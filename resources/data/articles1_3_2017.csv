Conservatives on Hill await health care bill,CNN,Lauren Fox,6/21/2017,"Washington (CNN) Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell might be on the verge of releasing a bill to repeal Obamacare, but hes got conservatives to convince before he can be sure he has the votes to pass it. On Tuesday, McConnell announced there would be a discussion draft unveiled Thursday on health care, but some in the right flank of his conference are already voicing skepticism for whats coming. I think theyve forgotten all the rallies where we said were going to repeal it. We had thousands of people standing up and cheering us on, saying were going to repeal it and now theyve gotten pretty   and I think they want to keep it, Sen. Rand Paul, a Kentucky Republican, told reporters Tuesday. Conservatives who are in the know are going to know that this isnt repeal. Most members havent seen legislative texts of the bill, but the process itself has been deeply frustrating for some of the conservatives who McConnell may need to convince to pass his bill. Tuesday afternoon Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah took to Facebook Live to tell constituents, if youre frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration. I share it wholeheartedly. Its not being written by us, Lee said, noting he was a member of the   working group. Its apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate. On policy, Paul has raised problems with voting for anything that included robust tax credits to help people buy insurance. And conservatives both on and off the Hill warn that they wont support any bill that doesnt lower premiums. Conservatives believe that in order to do that, Senate Republicans need to repeal many of the Obamacare regulations including community rating, which bars insurers from charging people with   conditions more for their health care coverage. The problem is that Senate leaders have been clear with the conference that they prefer not to repeal the community rating provision.  Sen. Ted Cruz, a conservative member of the Senates working group, said Tuesday    just days before a bill is expected to be released    that the Senate was nowhere near resolving the issues that are needed. It depends whats in the bill, Cruz said when asked if he could support it. There are many issues that are active topics of discussion. We are making steady progress, but were nowhere near resolving the issues that are needed. The most important issue is we have to drive down the cost of premiums. We have to make health insurance more affordable for families who are struggling. That is my number one priority. Across Capitol Hill, House conservatives are also growing a bit nervous with the lack of clarity on whats about to come out of the Senate. House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told CNN Tuesday in a phone call that he continues to have discussions with senators, but that no one seems to know whats about to be released. I think there is a whole lot of ambiguity, which gives everyone some concern that there isnt enough time to review, Meadows said. We have articulated some of the   and nice to haves on multiple occasions with a variety of senators. McConnell can only lose two Republican senators    any more than that and Senate leaders will fail to repeal Obamacare. That means McConnell cant afford to lose all three of his most conservative members. And conservatives are just part of the problem. Moderates also have deep concerns about what McConnell is about to release. Senators from Medicaid expansion states senators have been especially vocal against reports that Senate leaders may change the growth rate of Medicaid to standard inflation after 2025. That would put a significantly larger burden on states to finance their Medicaid programs."
Rubio jokes about failed Ivanka Trump hug,CNN,Caroline Kenny,6/21/2017,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Marco Rubio went on a tweetstorm Tuesday afternoon after his greeting with Ivanka Trump on Capitol Hill earlier that day went viral. A picture of the two apparently attempting an embrace surfaced on social media soon after the pair met at the Capitol to discuss tax reform and parental leave. Hours after the photo began to make the rounds on Twitter, Rubio responded from his account, saying he had just learned of the photo and would open his own investigation to expose what really happened during his encounter with Trump. Two minutes later, Rubio tweeted again, saying he has his own evidence to add to the discussion. He also added that he and his team were attempting to obtain video footage of the encounter to expose what really happened between himself and the White House adviser and first daughter. A call for help came next, when Rubio asked those who happened to be filming at the Senate carriage entrance Tuesday between 11:20 a. m. and 11:25 a. m. to hand over their footage. Thirty minutes after Rubio opened the investigation, he tweeted out a photograph that shed new light on the supposed hug. Just over a half hour after that first photo, Rubio tweeted another image providing a different perspective, announcing it as BREAKING NEWS. In a seventh tweet, Rubio closed the case by saying the evidence, and his own memory, concludes that no hug was attempted, although the images seem to show something different.  He closed out by calling the press covfefe false, a nod to the now famous misfire from President Donald Trumps Twitter account. Soon after Rubio closed the case, Ivanka responded to the anonymous sources by giving no comment. She also retweeted Rubios tweet with the photo of the blurred faces, calling it Fake news! and ensuring that her followers know that Rubio is, in fact, a good hugger, despite Rubios denial of the hugs. However, the two subjects of the investigation gave conflicting accounts of what exactly occurred. While Rubio claims a hug did not take place, Trumps tweets signify that a hug did indeed happen between the two.  While we may never know the truth, Rubio did show off his solid investigative chops. Maybe the senator has a future in journalism?"
Anger over Warmbier death grows amid travel ban calls,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,6/21/2017,"Washington (CNN) Anger over Otto Warmbiers fate continued to build Tuesday, with lawmakers declaring his death a murder and calling for travel restrictions to North Korea while the Trump administration considered how to respond.  The Warmbier family announced Tuesday that the    will be laid to rest Thursday morning in Ohio, as Republican and Democratic lawmakers decried his treatment by Pyongyang and floated the idea of banning American travel to North Korea as a first step.  The calls for a response come as spy satellites detected new activity at North Koreas underground nuclear test site for the first time in several weeks, according to two US officials who spoke to CNN. They also said military options for North Korea have recently been updated and will be presented to President Donald Trump if there is a nuclear test. However, on the eve of a   meeting with China, Pyongyangs largest trade partner and closest ally, the Trump administration has sounded a more cautious note, saying that they hold North Korea responsible for Warmbiers death but giving no indication of how they will respond.  Officials from Trump down have expressed sadness about the college students fate, but say that for now, they havent decided on a course of action.  We hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbiers unjust imprisonment, State Department spokesman Heather Nauert said Tuesday. Were still considering our options.  We have a great deal of resolve to try to handle the situation and try to hold North Korea responsible for the death of Mr. Warmbier and bring back those three Americans who do remain there, Nauert added.  Trump tweeted a somewhat conciliatory sounding message to Beijing, saying while I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi  China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried! He also tweeted that the U. S. once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim.  The usual menu of retaliatory measures against North Korea include sanctions that target its businesses and officials. Many lawmakers and analysts say the next step has to be sanctioning Chinese companies that do business with North Korea.  And lawmakers from both sides of the aisle are urging consideration of a ban on American travel to the isolated country.  Sen. Bob Corker, the Tennessee Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, raised the issue on MSNBC: Examining the travel implications and the fact that Americans do end up caught up in this situation, and should there be a travel ban for US citizens going there relative to this? Corker said. Thats something were looking at.  He noted that there are three other Americans detained in North Korea with   charges against them. Corker added: We have to figure out whether its best to allow people to do that, and then end up in a situation where were doing everything we can as a nation to get them out.  His colleague from Washington state, Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell, called for licensing of humanitarian groups that enter the country. We obviously want humanitarian work to continue in North Korea, but I think we need to think hard about making it safer for our citizens who do travel there.  The framework for a travel ban is already in place.  Last month, California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff and his Republican colleague Rep. Joe Wilson of South Carolina introduced the North Korea Travel Control Act. The bill would require the Treasury to issue regulations requiring a license for transactions related to travel to, from and within North Korea by US citizens    and bar licenses for tourist travel. Schiff was among many lawmakers who deemed Warmbiers death a murder, echoing Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain, Minnesota Democratic Sen. Al Franken and others when he said in a statement that the barbaric treatment of Otto Warmbier by the North Korean regime amounts to the murder of a US citizen.  Asked about potential travel restrictions, the State Departments Nauert said, were contemplating that right now.  Referring to Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, she added, the secretary has the authority to do it, he just has not come to a conclusion about how this would potentially work. Nauert stressed that the State Department issued a travel warning for North Korea that lays out the dangers. We think that our travel warning that weve had in place for some time is quite strong, she said.   Still, Americans continue to travel there for the novelty as well as to teach in universities and do discreet missionary work. About 17 US citizens have been detained in the past 10 years, including the three Americans who remain imprisoned there. Warmbier had gone for five days of sightseeing in 2016, only to be jailed for allegedly stealing a poster from a hotel and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. He was imprisoned for 17 months before being returned to the US, comatose, on June 13. Eastern Vision, a Hong   tour company that specializes in travel for university students and new graduates, stopped taking US citizens on tours to North Korea in early 2016, after Warmbiers arrest.  The company had previously taken two other Americans on a student exchange in Hong Kong to North Korea,   Rubio Chan told CNN on Tuesday. In the wake of Warmbiers death, Chan said the company will continue that suspension. On Tuesday, South Korean President Moon   expressed regrets over Warmbiers death and sent condolences to his friends and family, according to presidential spokesman Park  .  In an interview with a foreign media outlet, Moon said, it is deplorable that North Korea does not respect human rights, which are the universal norms and values of humankind."
"In Georgia, close isnt nearly good enough for Democrats",CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/21/2017,"(CNN) Winning isnt everything in politics. Its the only thing. And on Tuesday night, Democrats came up short in the   winnable special election of 2017: The suburban Atlanta 6th District of Georgia.  CNN called the race for Republican Karen Handel shortly after 10 p. m. ET, with her holding a lead of more than 10, 000 votes over Democrat Jon Ossoff. The race, which was to replace Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price in a seat Donald Trump carried by just a single point in 2016, was the most expensive in history    as both candidates, national parties and their associated super PACs dumped tens of millions into a seat widely seen as a barometer of the national mood. The final price tag on the race soared to north of $55 million. Both candidates messages were entirely nationalized as well. Ossoff sought to cast Handel, who had served as secretary of state in Georgia and run unsuccessfully for governor and Senate in recent years, as a tool of Trump.  Handel similarly sought to link Ossoff to Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Although Ossoff was heavily funded by liberal donors outside the state, he never cast himself as a progressive warrior    instead putting himself in the mold of a centrist problem solver.  That was enough to get him 48% in the states jungle primary in May in which all of the candidates from both parties ran on a single ballot. But it was not enough to push him over the top in a    race with a largely inoffensive Republican in Handel. While the race will be heavily analyzed for national repercussions and lessons    and it should be, given how much money and   both national parties did    this was also, in part, a local race. Handel was a known    if not beloved or maybe just      figure in the district thanks to her time in statewide office and her repeated unsuccessful runs for other offices.  Ossoff was a newcomer who didnt live in the district he was hoping to represent    a fact Handel and national Republicans made much of. (Nota bene: You dont have to live in the congressional district you represent you only have to live in the same state.) Neither was a very good candidate Ossoff was stiff and robotic on the trail while Handel struggled to win over voters that, ideologically, should have been hers from the start. The national implications, however, will dominate the story coming out of this race. Special elections    given their usually odd timing    are almost always a battle of base intensity between the two parties. The people who turn out to vote in a June 20 special election runoff    two months(!) after the initial vote    are hardcore partisans. The game in special elections, then, is not persuading voters who arent sure about their views. Its ensuring that the base is fired up and turns out. Everyone knew the Democratic base was ginned up beyond belief at the chance to send Trump a message about his performance in the first 150 days of his administration. The big question mark was whether the GOP base    perhaps worn down by Trumps seemingly   series of   wounds    would be equally as intense. It turns out that they were motivated    as has been the case since at least 2010    by the idea of Ossoff as nothing more than a Pelosi henchman. Republican strategists successfully convinced GOP voters that a vote for Ossoff was a vote for values anathema to their own. National Democrats will tell you that the race should have never been this close    and that Ossoff even threatening Handel suggests big trouble for Republicans on the ballot next November.  But deep down they know they needed    and still need    a win in a   race in which the fight was between   and  . Along with Archie Parnells loss Tuesday night in a South Carolina special House election, Democrats have now lost four straight specials this year where at least some within the party saw the chance for an upset. (Kansas 4th District and Montanas   seat are the other two.) There are no moral victories in politics. No matter what the losing side says    and they always say this    the only thing that really matters when it comes to special elections is the W and the L. Had Ossoff won, he would have become an immediate national sensation for Democrats    proof positive that the Trump agenda was being rejected even in   seats in the south. Donations to the Democratic House and Senate campaign committees would have soared. Democratic candidates on the fence about whether or not to run in 2018 would have taken the Ossoff victory as a sign that the national environment was beginning to tilt heavily in their sides favor. Now none of that will happen. Sure, it is still possible for Democrats to retake the House in 2018. As the May 2010 special election in Pennsylvanias 12th District proved, a single race is not necessarily all that predictive. Democrats won that   special only to go on and lose 63 seats    and the majority    less than six months later. But as important as what Democrats wont get is what Republicans avoid: The   panic that would have been triggered by a Handel loss. Had she come up short, any Republican incumbent in an even marginally competitive House seat would have immediately been on the phone to House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and National Republican Congressional Committee Chair Steve Stivers of Ohio fretting over how Trump was going to cost them their jobs. Those worries will disappear    at least for the moment    with Handels victory. So yes, this is one race. And history suggests theres just as good a chance that it means nothing as there is that it tells us everything we need to know about Trump and the 2018 election.  But Democrats are depressed and Republicans are rejoicing. And that tells you exactly why Georgia matters."
The secrets behind Kim Jong Uns personal piggy bank,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,6/21/2017,"(CNN) When the worlds most mysterious leader arrives for a parade, he steps out of a black Mercedes Benz and onto a red carpet. But who sold North Koreas Supreme Leader a brand new,     limousine? Despite international sanctions, Kim Jong Un continues to enjoy the good life, with recent purchases thought to include a gleaming white yacht, expensive liquors and even the equipment necessary to kit out a luxury ski resort. Those expenses soon add up: The country purchased $645. 8 million worth of luxury goods in 2012, according to a 2014 report from the UN. To put that into context, in 2015, North Korean imports totaled $3. 47 billion. But if you remove China    Pyongyangs biggest trading partner    from the equation, the breakdown reveals North Korea spent more on luxury goods than it did on licit imports from the rest of the world combined, according to UN data processed by the MIT Media Labs Observatory of Economic Complexity. So how can the leader a country that in March of last year warned its citizens to prepare for possible famine and severe economic hardship afford to live in such luxury? Experts say these types of purchases are made using Kims personal piggy bank, filled by Pyongyangs illicit dealings across the globe. North Korea has been accused of crimes such as hacking banks, selling weapons, dealing drugs, counterfeiting cash and even trafficking endangered species    operations that are believed to rake in hundreds of millions of dollars. That money also helps pay for the countrys nuclear and missile programs, both of which Pyongyang believes it needs in order to deter any   attempt at regime change, experts say. North Koreas nuclear aspirations have progressed forward rapidly despite sanctions, and Pyongyang has resisted any US attempts at negotiation that mandates   up front. North Korea has blatantly violated international law with their nuclear testing, illicit sales, and the ramping up of their nuclear program, said Republican Representative Doug Lamborn, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a leading advocate for missile defense in Washington. Its nearly impossible to track these illicit funds accurately, as theyre likely hidden away. But a 2008 Congressional Research Service report said Pyongyang could generate anywhere from $500 million to $1 billion in profits annually from its   gains. North Korea will sell anything to anyone as long as they pay, Anthony Ruggiero, a former deputy director of the US Treasury Department and an expert in the use of targeted financial measures, said at a panel sponsored by the Foundation for Defense of Democracies last week. That money funds Pyongyangs pursuit of a   nuclear weapon and the lavish lifestyle of the countrys elite, keeping them happy as sanctions cripple the economy, according to analysts CNN spoke to. In the end, its an important way for Kim to cement his power and prevent challenges to his authority, experts say. Thats income that goes directly into the pockets or the bank accounts of the North Korean leadership. (Taking it away) can actually have a disproportionately large impact compared to trade flow, said Sheena Greitens, a professor at the University of Missouri who has been studying North Koreas illicit finance activities for the last 10 to 15 years. In order to really pressure Kim until hes desperate enough to get to the negotiating table on the US terms, US President Donald Trump may need to go after that money, analysts say. But cutting off that revenue may prove difficult, like playing a game of international   . This is a regime thats really good at finding new, creative illicit ways to earn hard currency and sometimes thats coming up with new activities and sometimes its a matter of shifting geographic locations of those activities, said Greitens. If you wanted to try to pressure and contain North Koreas ability to earn from these illicit activities, youd have to also close off its ability to adapt. A pressure campaign Kims perceived flair for the dramatic    South Korean intelligence alleges hes conducted   gun executions and complex assassination plots    is something he shares with his late father, Kim Jong Il. The elder Kim was a noted cinephile and James Bond fan, and analysts say his fondness for spy thrillers appeared to influence his leadership    South Korea says he tried to assassinate enemies with a pen, kidnapped movie stars in order to boost the countrys own film industry and created of whats known as Office 39. The US Treasury Department says Office 39 is the bureau that provides critical support to North Korean leadership in part through engaging in illicit economic activities and managing slush funds.  The money basically hides in plain sight, according to   North Korea specialist John Park. North Korean overseas networks have been extremely adaptive to the combined pressures of international sanctions, in large part due to their ability to nest and disguise their illicit business within the licit trade, according to Park. Though the Obama administration tried to target it with sanctions, Office 39 is still believed to be in operation.   US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States will try to further stymie North Korean operations by punishing third parties that help Pyongyang skirt sanctions. Its a pressure campaign that has a knob on it, Tillerson told State Department employees on May 3. Id say were at about dial setting five or six right now. Though Tillerson did not specify how those   sanctions would work, part of the strategy involves asking countries around the globe to scale back their diplomatic relationships with Pyongyang. What we are more appropriately asking them to do is to take a look at the diplomatic relations that they have with North Korea . .. North Korea, in many countries, has a diplomatic presence that clearly exceeds their diplomatic needs, W. Patrick Murphy, the US State Departments deputy assistant secretary in the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs, told reporters on a phone call.  Keeping them high and dry, North Korean diplomats around the world have been accused of using their diplomatic privileges to conducted crimes such as smuggling gold and running guns. Embassy staff are useful to North Korea because they are mobile and can provide diplomatic cover for shady dealings, the United Nations says. To cut off the illicit money, the US likely needs to deny North Korea the opportunity to use embassies as fronts for criminal operations, something the United Nations accused the country of doing in 2016. North Korea has been quite wily in recent years in trying to evade the UN Security Council resolutions . .. using diplomatic cover for some of its activities, Murphy said. That creativity may have been on display in recent years in Southeast Asia, where local and international authorities have accused diplomatic staff in connection with a potential assassination plot and an intricate arms smuggling operation. To that end, one partner the United States says its pursuing to deal with North Korea is Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte, whos serving as the chair of the Association of Southeast Nations (ASEAN). Of the 10 states that belong to the regional organization, eight host North Korean embassies, according to the National Committee on North Korea. Another 39 countries around the world also host a North Korean embassy. If you think about strategy for attacking illicit sources of finance and pressuring illicit sources of finance, youd actually want to go to some of the places that are flying under the radar, Greitens said.  Whether US pressure works remains to be seen.  The United States has been pressuring a number of Southeast Asian states for years now to crack down or reduce the extent of their relationship with North Korea, said The Diplomats Prashanth Parameswaran.  Southeast Asian states maintain these links with North Korea out of various considerations    diplomatic, cultural links, economic links. And theyve proven that they want to keep this going on . .. these countries will make their own determinations with respect with what to do with North Korea. China factor, The US will need more than just buy in from Southeast Asia for the strategy to work, analysts say. Theyll need China too.  Beijing accounts for about 85% of Pyongyangs imports, according to UN data. Thats a lifeline for the North Korean economy, one which prevents the US from really putting the squeeze on North Korea. You certainly want to cut off all areas of revenue but its really just sort of nibbling around the edges when youre going to eventually have to come back to what youre going to do about China, Ruggiero, the former Treasury Department official, told CNN. Convincing China to take comprehensive action that not only targets its own companies but could disrupt the power balance in the region will be no easy feat, according to David Cohen, former deputy director of the US Central Intelligence Agency.  China is most worried about destabilizing the Korean Peninsula and has proven they will act in their own best interest, Cohen said.  But Pyongyangs reliance on Chinese entities also reveals an area of vulnerability, according to a recent study from C4ADS, a     research group focused on exposing illicit trade networks. From 2013 to 2016, there were only 5, 233 companies within China that either imported goods from, or exported goods to, North Korea. To put that number in perspective, as of 2016, 67, 163 Chinese companies exported to South Korea, the report said. Targeting specific key nodes can have a disproportionate impact. President Trump has been courting Chinese President Xi Jinping for his help with North Korea. He hosted Xi at his luxurious South Florida    estate in April for a   summit, during which North Korea was discussed. Trumps language toward Beijing    on the campaign trail he said China was raping the United States    has softened since the meeting. Experts say Beijings seriousness about cracking down on its unruly neighbor may be the key to stopping Pyongyangs illicit activities. It all comes down to China, said Ruggiero. In the end its going to require going after Chinese banks and Chinese companies that are complicit in North Koreas sanction evasion."
Otto Warmbiers family declines autopsy,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/21/2017,"(CNN) The family of American college student Otto Warmbier objected to an autopsy, leaving the former North Korea detainees official cause of death a mystery for the time being.  The Hamilton County Coroners Office in Ohio confirmed that it received and examined the   s body after his death on Monday. The Warmbier familys objection to an autopsy was honored, the office said, and only an external examination was performed.   The coroners office reviewed medical records from the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and the air ambulance service that helped bring Warmbier from Pyongyang to Cincinnati after 17 months. Extensive conversations with his treating physician took place, too.   No conclusions about the cause and manner of Mr. Warmbiers death have been drawn at this time as there are additional medical records and imaging to review and people to interview, the statement said. His death led to strong condemnations of the regime and speculation about the implications. Politicians renewed calls for the regime to release three US citizens being held in the country. RELATED: The tour company that took Otto Warmbier to North Korea halts trips for Americans, Warmbier visited North Korea in January 2016 on a sightseeing tour. He was arrested for allegedly stealing a political sign from a restricted area and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor.  US President Donald Trumps administration worked to secure his return. He died less than a week after returning from North Korea. He could not speak or move voluntarily and his doctors said he suffered extensive brain damage. His treating physicians said he suffered from unresponsive wakefulness, a condition also known as persistent vegetative state. In a news conference before Warmbiers death, they said they could not speculate on the cause of his condition. But they found no evidence that he had contracted botulism, casting doubt on North Koreas claim that he fell into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill.  This pattern of brain injury is usually seen as result of cardiopulmonary arrest where blood supply to the brain is inadequate for a period of time, resulting in the death of brain tissue, Dr. Daniel Kanter said last week. A funeral will be held Thursday at Warmbiers alma mater, Wyoming High School in Ohio."
Saudi Arabias king replaces nephew with son as heir to throne,CNN,James Griffiths,6/21/2017,"(CNN) In a surprise reshuffle at the top of Saudi Arabias royal hierarchy, the countrys king has removed his nephew as crown prince in favor of his son, Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz.  Mohammed bin Salman will now be first in line to succeed his father King Salman as ruler of the Gulf nation, a key US ally.  The    has been appointed deputy prime minister and will continue in his role as defense minister, according to a royal decree cited by state media.  Despite his youth, Mohammed bin Salman has long had a visible role in the government, and has spearheaded the kingdoms attempts to wean itself off oil as part of an economic strategy announced last year. Key reform policies currently in place    such as the Vision 2030 plan and a planned IPO by Saudi oil giant Aramco    were already being driven by him.  As defense minister, he has overseen the   military campaign against Yemens Houthi rebels, which has caused the deaths of thousands of civilians since 2015 and left the country spiraling towards total social, economic and institutional collapse, according to the United Nations. The consolidation of power, which was more rapid than expected, gives allies a clear indication of who will potentially lead the kingdom for decades.  It may also send a signal to other regional powers about Saudi Arabias foreign policy aims at a time of heightened tensions in the Middle East. Consolidation of power, When and if MBS, as he is know, succeeds his father, he will be the first Saudi king who is not the son of the countrys founder King Abdul Aziz Al Saud, also known as Ibn Saud. There has been speculation for years as to the future line of succession, with the throne moving between the increasingly aged sons of Ibn Saud.  By elevating his own son first to deputy crown prince, and now crown prince, King Salman appears to have cut off other branches of the family from the throne. Barak Seener, chief executive of Strategic Intelligentia and former Middle East fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, said that as successor, Mohammed bin Salman will have greater influence to implement social and economic modernization efforts.  Seener predicted this would spill over into Saudi Arabias foreign policy, with the new crown prince favoring a more confrontational stance in particular with Iran, a major Shiite power.  As the Trump administration has strategically realigned the US away from Iran and towards Sunni states, (Mohammed bin Salman) is the ideal leader for the US to coordinate defense and security efforts in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and the Gulf, Seener said.  Cousin bumped down line of succession  Mohammed bin Salmans elevation to    to the throne comes at the expense of his cousin, the now former Crown Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz. He had been named to that role in 2015, in what many at the time called a surprise power shift, replacing the Kings   Prince Muqrin as future ruler and bumping Mohammed bin Salman to second in the line of succession.  That move has now been overturned, with Mohammed bin Nayef also stripped of his title and his roles as deputy prime minister and interior minister. Images published in Saudi state media showed the new crown prince kissing the hand of Mohammed bin Nayef, who was said to have pledged allegiance to the man who has replaced him at the Safa Palace in Mecca. A young heir for a young nation, Mohammed bin Salmans appointment puts the age of Saudi Arabias heir much closer to the countrys median age of 27.  His age has made him popular among young people, especially after he demanded more entertainment choices in an effort to decrease the number of Saudis vacationing abroad. Since then, the conservative kingdom has set up a series of activities that are popular in the west, including comedy shows and monster truck competitions.   Mohammed bin Salman has long been a prominent figure in Saudi politics, seen as a key power player behind the king and a reformer by Saudi standards. He visited the United States in March, where he had lunch at the White House with US President Donald Trump. In an interview with the Washington Post in April, he praised the countrys relationship with the US, saying that without American influence we would have ended up like North Korea.  Saudi laws make it difficult for many women to work, travel, undergo medical procedures or go to university without the permission of a male relative, or spouse. Those laws are under review.  One of the key goals of Vision 2030 is to increase womens participation in the workplace. Since Mohammed bin Salman unveiled the project last year, three top jobs in finance    including the head of the stock exchange    have been filled by women. Women are also forbidden from driving in the kingdom, an issue Mohammed bin Salman has taken a cautious approach towards.  Society is still not convinced of women driving and believes it has very negative consequences if women are allowed to drive, he said in April 2016. This is up to Saudi society. We cant force something it doesnt want.  He has also called for Saudis to be given more influence in government, telling the Economist last year that he wanted to build a country that guarantees the participation of everyone in  .  Mohammed bin Salman has also voiced support for freedom of expression and human rights.  According to   NGO Freedom House, Saudi Arabia restricts almost all political rights and civil liberties through a combination of oppressive laws and the use of force.  In the most recent Freedom in the World report, the group listed Saudi Arabia as the ninth least free society in the world.  Tense region, The Saudi political reshuffle comes amid the biggest crisis to hit the Middle East in decades    an unprecedented,   diplomatic freeze of Qatar by key allies and neighbors which started on June 5. Gulf allies have accused Qatar of allegedly supporting terrorist groups but many observers have been surprised by the severity of their response.  US State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters this week Washington is mystified by the continued blockade of Qatar.  The more time goes by, the more doubt is raised about the actions taken by Saudi Arabia and the (United Arab Emirates), she said. Opinion: Qatar must start changing its behavior"
"Slain Muslim girl may have been sexually assaulted, police say",CNN,Chris Boyette,6/21/2017,"(CNN) A Muslim teen who was attacked and killed early Sunday as she and a group of teenagers walked back to a mosque in Virginia may have been sexually assaulted, investigators say. Police are investigating the possibility that Nabra Hassanen, 17, was sexually assaulted, Fairfax County police spokeswoman Tawny Wright said Tuesday.  At a news conference Monday evening, when asked if Hassanen had been sexually assaulted, Fairfax County Police Lt. Bryan Holland responded that there was an assault that occurred in Fairfax County and we had another assault that occurred in Loudoun [County]. Police said Darwin Martinez Torres saw the group walking and riding bicycles in the street and on the sidewalk. Torres became so enraged after arguing with one teen he drove up on a curb, police said. He later found the group in a nearby parking lot, chased them on foot with a baseball bat and allegedly beat Hassanen in what local police are calling a road rage incident. Torres, 22, put the injured teen in his car, officials said. Her body was found Sunday evening in Loudoun County. Torres entered the United States illegally, according to an immigration official. ICE spokeswoman Carissa Cutrell said Torres will be afforded all legal processes. Typically that means he will go through criminal court proceedings and serve any corresponding sentences if convicted. Then, based on the detainer, he would be transferred to ICE custody and take his case through immigration court, according to Cutrell.  Authorities in Fairfax County said theres no evidence the killing was a hate crime. Hassanens father said he believes she was killed because she was wearing an abaya, a traditional black cloak. The Virginia Commonwealths attorney for Fairfax County, Raymond Morrogh, declined to discuss the evidence of the case, and would not say whether he believed a hate crime occurred.  These cases evolve, the investigation is ongoing    who knows what will come up    so I would be loath to characterize it one way or the other, he said. Everything is on the table until we get all the evidence. Torres has been charged with murder and faces a maximum punishment of life in prison. Morrogh declined to comment on the possibility that Hassanen was sexually assaulted, but added that in any case, its not unusual to add charges. Torres appeared by videoconference from jail for an arraignment Monday in a Fairfax County juvenile court, Morrogh said. In court, Torres was appointed a federal defender, though the    told the judge that his aunt may hire him a lawyer he was hoping she would, Morrogh said.  A preliminary hearing in the case is set for July 19 in Fairfax County.  James Ware with the Fairfax County Office of the Public Defender declined to provide the name of Torres   attorney and added he had no comment on the Torres case. Hassanens funeral prayer service will be held at the All Dulles Area Muslim Society Center in Sterling on Wednesday, according to the Council on   Relations."
"Tour Group That Led Otto Warmbier to His Death Keeps North Korea Trips, Bans Americans",Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/20/2017,"Young Pioneer Tours, a travel operation that brings Western communist sympathizers into North Korea, Cuba, and other danger zones, announced Tuesday it will no longer accept Americans on its trips to North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier. [Warmbier, 22, died Monday following his release from North Korean custody last week. He had traveled to Pyongyang with Young Pioneer Tours and stood accused of attempting to steal a communist propaganda poster from his hotel.  In a March 2016 hostage video, Warmbier confessed to the crime and claimed that the U. S. government had bribed him to tamper with the poster. In that confession, he also thanked North Korea for its humanitarian treatment of a severe criminal like him. In a blog post on its website, Young Pioneer Tours announced, We will no longer be organising tours for US citizens to North Korea.  The devastating loss of Otto Warmbiers life has led us to reconsider our position on accepting American tourists. There had not been any previous detainment in North Korea that has ended with such tragic finality and we have been struggling to process the result, the statement reads. Now, the assessment of risk for Americans visiting North Korea has become too high.  While the group condemns the way that North Korea handled the detention as appalling and a tragedy, it does not condemn the North Korean regime for arresting Warmbier in the first place or for its record of detaining Americans to be used as diplomatic bargaining chips. The company also claims that it made constant requests to North Korean officials for information on Warmbier but was told only that he was fine.  Warmbier arrived in the United States last week with extensive brain damage according to American doctors that cared for him in Ohio before his death. North Korean officials claimed that he had been in a coma for about a year after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill, but American doctors said they saw no evidence of botulism. Warmbiers father, Fred, attacked Young Pioneer Tours and its ilk in the press conference he hosted last week, following Otto Warmbiers return to Ohio. The North Koreans lure Americans to travel to North Korea via tour groups, run out of China, who advertise slick ads on the internet proclaiming, No American ever gets detained on our tours and This is a safe place to go, he explained. At the time, the New York Times reported, the Young Pioneers website read that being American was not at all a problem in traveling to North Korea, despite U. S. State Department warnings against such travel. Since the change in policy this morning, the site notes that it will not accept American travelers on its North Korea trips. Other than that minor change, the groups misleading portrayal of North Korea, clearly designed to appeal to impressionable youth, remains on the site. Despite what you may hear, for most nationalities, North Korea is probably one of the safest places on Earth to visit provided you follow the laws as provided by our documentation and   briefings, the website claims. It applauds North Koreas not allowing foreigners to go anywhere in the country without a communist chaperone because it adds to the mysticism of the country.  It warns tourists not to speak too much during the trip: If youre quiet and listen youll be surprised just how much you can learn.  Young Pioneers also still boasts budget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from and a blog replete with praise for a dizzying array of oppressive regimes ranging from Cuba (Were taking you to Cuba this December for our annual Che Guevara Revolutionary Tour! ) to Myanmar (One of the most special and unique travel experiences, due to its stunning geography, rich and varied culture and warm, proud people) and China (Once in a lifetime Maoist adventure). Young Pioneers, named after the communist equivalent to the Hitler Youth, calls itself a company that craves communist kitsch.  Its founder, British   Gareth Johnson, writes in his biography that his   love for the people and culture of the DPRK led him to establish the group and praises North Koreas great, plentiful, and cheap! seafood. At least one American, Amanda Moore, is listed as an official in the company. While the company is in the public eye for leading Warmbier to his death, Young Pioneers is not the only group preying on the curiosity of young Westerners with North Korea trips. One tour group, the Koryo Group, also claims on its website that North Korea is probably one of the safest countries in the world for a tourist.  New Korea Tours promises a tour of communism which starts with the 1950s reconstruction.        Every tourist who has traveled with us has said it has been one of the highlights in their world travels."
Theres Only One Trump Administration Position Thats Gaining Popularity And Its Going To Shock You - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Carney,6/20/2017,"While support for the Trump administrations positions on many issues has declined in recent months, one of the presidents most controversial policies has held its ground or perhaps even grown in popularity. [Some of the administrations most popular positions have seen their popularity decline, according to CNBCs quarterly All American Survey.  The share of Americans who say they somewhat or strongly support the administrations plans to rebuild American infrastructure, for example, has declined to 62 percent from 75 percent three months earlier. Support for individual tax cuts has fallen to 59 percent from 64 percent, while support for cuts to business taxes fell to 50 percent from 54 percent.  Renegotiating trade deals has lost support, falling to 50 percent from 58 percent. Support for regulatory relief has declined to 44 percent from 47 percent. Public support for repealing Obamacare very nearly held steady, losing just one percentage point of support from 45 percent to 44 percent. But the public remains strongly divided on healthcare, with opposition to the administrations repeal and replace plans edging up to 38 percent from 37 percent in April. So which issue has gained popularity? Banning immigration from specific Middle Eastern and African countries. Public support for the ban rose by a percentage point, with 44 percent of Americans now saying the strongly or somewhat support the ban. That slight rise was due to a one percentage point gain in the strongly support category. Opposition to the ban has slightly declined, falling to 49 percent from 50 percent. The share of respondents who said they strongly oppose the plan, however, saw a steeper decline, to 32 percent from 36 percent."
Sean Spicer Confirms WH Meeting with Potential People for Press Vacancies - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/20/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer confirmed during Tuesdays briefing that the White House is seeking input and meeting with potential people after reporters asked him if his role would be changing. [Reporters asked Spicer about speculations of change in the White House press shop, and inquired as to possible changes in his role during the afternoon   press briefing.  He was asked if its true that his role is changing and whats in store? Spicer responded, Im right here.  He added, You can keep taking your selfies, an apparent reference to a tweet from two reporters in the room. Spicers favorite gals are here, for his swan song? @AprilDRyan pic. twitter.

Weve been meeting with potential people that may be of service to this administration. I dont think that should come as any surprise. But were always looking for ways to do a better job of articulating the Presidents message and his agenda. Spicer added that when they have an announcement regarding personnel, the administration will let the press know. Another reporter later commented: Youre probably wearing more than one hat at the moment before asking about a great deal of unrest      about a lack of press briefings, a lack of communication with you directly outside of say, the office        unpack the idea behind fewer on camera briefings? Spicer replied that the White House press team has respect for what reporters do. He added that the White House press team is very available and that the briefing is just one avenue to be available to the press. He asserted that data reflects that the President has had a significant level of interaction with the press when compared to previous administrations. Spicer said the press staff has been available almost    . He went on to say that the press will always advocate for more availability. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana"
Chelsea Clinton accuses Bannon of fat shaming Sean Spicer,CNN,Z. Byron Wolf,6/20/2017,"Washington (CNN) The punchline, for lack of a better word, in a piece in The Atlantic on the   decay of the White House press is a text message, presumably joking, from White House adviser Steven Bannon to a reporter explaining why Sean Spicer has spent less and less time in front of cameras at the podium. Sean got fatter, texted Bannon. We dont KNOW that Bannon was joking, mind you. He didnt respond to   questions, according to writer Rosie Gray in The Atlantic piece. But treating the question as a joke would be in line with how the Trump administration has generally regarded the press briefings, which have been rarer and rarer and not often in front of cameras. There was one scheduled late Tuesday morning for later in the day. Chelsea Clinton, the former first daughter whose mother was defeated last November by President Donald Trump, did not take the Bannon text as a joke. The White House using fat shaming to justify increased opacity. 2017, she tweeted. Later, she responded to a reporter from Breitbart, the conservative news site once run by Bannon. Oh ok. So using fat shaming to avoid answering questions about increasing opacity. Got it. 2017. She also responded to another tweeter who accused her of a   response from the   left. Actually, Clinton wrote back, Just me as I was standing in line @ Starbucks earlier. Fat shaming isnt a joke I find funny. Ever. There you have it. Heres what weve learned:  Conservatives think Bannon was joking. Thats in line with how the White House has treated the press briefingChelsea Clinton disagrees and thinks it is fat shaming. She also disagrees with the decay of the White House press briefing because it leads to opacity and allows the White House to refuse to answer questions. She stands in line and tweets at Starbucks like everyone else. We can presume that Clintons tweets wont do much to help Spicer, who is either stepping into a higher role at the White House or on thin ice (or both) depending on who youre listening to. Trump was apparently none too pleased earlier this year when Spicer was portrayed on Saturday Night Live by Melissa McCarthy, a sketch so successful it was stretched across the shows entire season. But it is also true that Trump has suggested the briefing is not a good fit for his White House since his spokesman cant be expected to keep up with his thinking. And he has consistently undercut things both Spicer and Sarah Huckabee Sanders have said from the podium. That doesnt mean the White House should stop doing the briefing, although journalists like CNNs Jim Acosta have raised serious alarm bells about that possibility. Chelsea Clinton, for her part, has come to the defense of Trump White House officials before, when it serves her purpose. Back in March, she called comments by Democratic Rep. Cedric Richmond about a photo featuring Kellyanne Conway taking a picture in the Oval Office despicable and demanded an apology for Conway. Cedric later apologized, although he denied he was joking in the first place.  Twitter trolling the Trump White House and general wrongness she sees on social media has increasingly become one of Clintons   roles. As CNNs Hunter Schwarz wrote earlier this year: Perhaps the Clinton most effective at Twitter trolling, though, is Clintons daughter, Chelsea. Employing Internet colloquialisms, like linking to the latest Trump controversy while referencing how early it is (as if to say, Trump has already ruined X, Y, and Z, and its only Monday) @ChelseaClinton benefits from being conversational. Her feed is more typical liberal millennial than her scripted political family members. In this case, she was able to troll the White House for its lack of transparency and call out fat shaming in the same tweet."
Warmbier death raises pressure on White House,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,6/20/2017,"Washington (CNN) Otto Warmbiers death as a result of his treatment in North Korea could increase calls for the US to take a tougher line on China, as the two nations prepare to meet in Washington on Wednesday. To date the Trump administrations policy for dealing with North Koreas increasingly aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons has been to push Beijing to pressure Pyongyang, its longtime ally. Its an approach that resembles the Obama administration strategy and, observers say, has shown no greater success in slowing Pyongyangs steady march towards developing nuclear weapons and the missile capability to deliver them as far as North America.  If ever there was a wake up to call to greater action, its Ottos death, said Bruce Klingner, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundations Asian Studies Center. Warmbiers family announced that the    passed away Monday. He was flown home from North Korea on June 13 after 17 months of detention in the isolated nation that counts China as its closest trading partner.  The news quickly sparked calls from Congress for a tougher line. The United States of America cannot and should not tolerate the murder of its citizens by hostile powers, Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona said in a statement. North Korea is threatening its neighbors, destabilizing the   region, and rapidly developing the technology to strike the American homeland with nuclear weapons, McCain continued. Now it has escalated to brutalizing Americans, including three other citizens currently imprisoned in North Korea. Warmbiers death comes two days before the annual   diplomatic and security dialogue in Washington where Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis will meet their Chinese counterparts. Pressure on Trump, The young Ohioans death may force President Donald Trump to take a tougher line with North Korea, a shift that could increase tensions with Beijing. Like Obama, Trump has been talking tough, but continuing to pull punches on both North Korea and China, Klingner said. Klingner pointed in particular to the Trump administrations failure so far to apply secondary sanctions on Chinese companies that do business with North Korea, particularly the companies involved in the countrys development of nuclear and ballistic missile technology.  The administration has imposed penalties on a limited tranche of North Korea violators and continues to not impose secondary sanctions on Chinese violators given a nave belief that President Xi will do more than China has in the past, Klingner said. Weve heard that song many times before and always been disappointed.  Leon Panetta, who served as Secretary of Defense under President Obama between 2011 and 2013, noted that we have sanctions in place, adding that they could be enforced in a more vigorous way by ourselves as well as the Chinese.  Panetta said that in the wake of Warmbiers death, the Trump administrations options include demanding an explanation from China, diplomatic protests, and increased sanctions. This is not acceptable and the Chinese government needs to find out what happened, Panetta told CNNs Wolf Blitzer.  Trump, who has said in the past hed be honored to meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, has repeatedly said that if China doesnt deal with Pyongyang, the US would be willing to go it alone. US reactions  On Monday, the President expressed dismay at the news of Warmbiers death, calling North Korea a brutal regime and telling tech CEOs gathered at the White House that a lot of bad things happened to the student while he was held there. In a written statement, Trump said, Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ottos family and friends, and all who loved him. Ottos fate deepens my administrations determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency, Trumps statement continued. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim. US Ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, also issued a statement that said Warmbiers fate would be an indelible reminder to us of the barbaric nature of the North Korean dictatorship.  Tillerson said that we hold North Korea accountable for Otto Warmbiers unjust imprisonment and demand the release of three other Americans who have been illegally detained. North Korea will be a top priority for Tillerson and Mattis going into Wednesdays talks with China, said Susan Thornton, the State Departments acting assistant secretary for the bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs.  Thornton told reporters Monday that US officials are aiming to advance concrete cooperation with China towards a peaceful resolution of the nuclear and missile threat from North Korea. Noting that repeated UN resolutions forbid the DPRKs ballistic missile and nuclear programs, Thornton added that, we continue to urge China to exert its unique leverage as North Koreas largest trading partner, including by fully implementing all UN Security Council sanctions. Klingner said that during the US meetings with China, the message should be very clear that the US agreement to hold back on secondary sanctions should be coming to a close.  He added that the Trump administrations hesitancy to impose secondary sanctions, like that of previous administrations, is simply giving de facto immunity from US law to Chinese violators. Nuclear ambitions, Klingner pointed to recent declarations by North Koreans in unofficial meetings with US figures    sometimes referred to as track two or track 1. 5 dialogues. At one such meeting recently, North Korean officials stated that denuclearization is off the table and that theres nothing the US or South Korea can offer that will induce them to stop pursuing nuclear capability. After multiple missile launches in May, the UN Security Council voted unanimously on June 2 to introduce new sanctions targeting Pyongyangs nuclear and missile program. Five days later, North Korea responded by firing four   missiles into the sea east of the Korean peninsula.  Administration officials have studiously avoided talking about retaliation for the condition in which Warmbiers condition, most recently Monday morning, before Warmbiers death, when Thornton told reporters that we are very happy to see that Otto Warmbier has been able to return to his family in Ohio and be reunited with them.  The former University of Virginia student was comatose when he returned early from a   prison sentence of hard labor for stealing a political poster. North Korea said his medical state was the result of botulism poisoning.  Intelligence reports suggest he had been repeatedly beaten."
"Vanity Fair: No, Gal Gadot Isnt Making 46 Times Less Than Henry Cavill",Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/20/2017,"Vanity Fair has   the recent viral outrage over Wonder Woman star Gal Gadot supposedly being paid 46 times less than Man of Steel star Henry Cavill for their work on similar films. [From Vanity Fair:  It was a   stat that swiftly went viral Tuesday morning: Gal Gadot, the magnetic star of the summer hit Wonder Woman, was paid just $300, 000 for a film that had already made $573 million worldwide. Meanwhile, Henrys Cavill had been paid $14 million   46 times as much!   for his own first outing as Superman in Man of Steel. It would be perfectly indicative of the gender pay gap that lingers in Hollywood. . . if it were at all true. As the Elle article that sent the stat viral said itself, Cavills $14 million earning include bonuses for box office performance, while Gadots $300, 000, per a 2014 Variety report, is just the base salary for each film shes made thus far in the DC Universe, they continued. Though the details of Cavills reported $14 million could not be verified, a source with knowledge of studio negotiations on franchise films told Vanity Fair, It certainly isnt for one picture. Thats insane. For superhero franchises just getting started, though, the process is usually simple: find a star on the rise, pay them relatively little, and then offer more if the franchise takes off. Marvel pioneered the effort with Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, and Chris Hemsworth, all of whom were reportedly paid less than $500, 000 for their first solo superhero outings, but eventually landed much bigger paydays for subsequent entries. (Downey Jr. famously made $50 million for The Avengers, and helped his   negotiate higher salaries themselves.) Cavill, like Hemsworth and Evans and Gadot when their franchises started, was more of an unknown, and likely to have signed the same lowball salary contract with a promise of future returns. Despite Vanity Fairs explanation, the exaggerated facts, which were pushed by Elle Magazine, have since gone viral, with Teen Vogues Lauren Duca receiving over 10, 000 retweets and 20, 000 likes on an outraged Twitter post, which was also shared by Piers Morgan, who responded, Now THIS is sexism.  Gal Gadot made $300, 000 for Wonder Woman as compared to Henry Cavills $14M for Man of Steel. The most compelling DC villain is the pay gap.

"Russian Fighter Makes Provocative, Erratic Approach Within 5 Feet of U.S. Recon Plane - Breitbart",Breitbart,John Hayward,6/20/2017,"U. S. military officials told Fox News on Tuesday morning that an armed Russian   fighter jet flew within 5 feet of an unarmed American   recon plane over the Baltic Sea on Monday. [The officials said the Russian aircraft made provocative maneuvers and flew erratically after making a rapid approach to the American plane. The U. S. military classified the encounter as unsafe.   The officials stated that the Russian jet had    missiles visible under its wings. As Fox News observes, there have been a number of provocative encounters between Russian planes and American planes and ships in the Baltic, but few of them featured the Russian pilots making an approach this close. The U. S. military recently completed a training exercise in the Baltics, and of course tensions are high after Russias threatening response to the American downing of a Syrian warplane on Sunday."
High School Basketball Coaches Fired After Taking School Bus on Beer Run - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,6/20/2017,"Two high school basketball coaches in Oklahoma were fired after taking a school bus to go buy beer while their team, from Tishomingo High School, attended a camp at Connors State University. [According to Tishomingo player Kyle Miller, We noticed that the school bus was gone but he had told us to stay in our dorms and so we proceeded to do that and we just didnt find anything out until the next day.   The coaches caper was unraveled by a store clerk who, apparently, thought it concerning that two men would show up to purchase beer in a school bus. The clerk then called Connors State, a school that does not allow alcohol on its grounds. Officials from Tishomingo High School became aware of the incident, then fired the two coaches. Sadly for the players from Tishomingo, the incident led to the team having to leave camp a day early. Miller summed up the disappointment of the team to KFOR. com, We were pretty upset because we paid money out of pocket to go to that camp, because we had to stay for three nights and we had to end up leaving on the second day.

Limbaugh: Democratic Party Has Become the Largest Hate Group in This Country - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/20/2017,"Tuesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh pointed out the mood of the Democratic Party, which he described as resentful and unhappy, and noted liberal comedians are consumed by hatred.   This combination of negative emotions according to Limbaugh has made the Democratic Party the largest hate group in the country. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): Let me tell you something, folks. There is an inescapable observation and conclusion, and it is this. You have to look very hard     and you have to spend a long time looking     to find a genuinely happy or content   political person. Whether theyre an activist or not. If theyre engaged in any way, shape, manner, or form of politics, theyre not happy, no matter what. When they elected Obama, they got angrier. They got more enraged. After every success they have, nothing is ever enough. No amount much success ever makes them happy. Every success they have seems to tell them how little theyve actually done and how much more there is and how deeply resentful of that they are. The bottom line is: You just dont encounter happy, laughing liberals. Even their comedians are consumed by hatred. The Democrat Partys become the largest hate group in this country. Even their comedians are angry and enraged, and that suffices as comedy. I think its one of the reasons why   comics have become primary sources of news for other   liberals. So theres never any happiness, there never is any contentment. You dont see any real laughter. You just see a constant level of rage     and Im telling you, it isnt healthy. Talk about sustainable? That cannot be sustained. A healthy mind and heart cannot be sustained by the degree of rage and hatred that we see in the American left today. You have to ask: Why dont their successes make them happy? Look at what theyve done in the area of marriage. Theyve totally upended it. They have succeeded in not just redefining a word that has stood for however many number of years     tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, millions of years     that humans have been plodding and walking the earth. And even after they succeed with this, they get angry. They dont ever seem satisfied. Its the most amazing thing. And were all paying the price for it, this constant rage, this constant anger. They lose elections, and it is taken as one of the most outrageous things that could happen. (  DailyRushbo) Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
CNNS Tapper: Trump Empirically Worse and More Opaque Than Obama - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/20/2017,"Tuesday on CNNs The Lead, host Jake Tapper said on transparency issues President Donald Trumps administration is empirically worse and more opaque.  than President Barack Obamas administration was.  Tapper said, Lets turn to our politics lead now. This afternoon, Press Secretary Sean Spicer held an   briefing and took reporters questions. That is something that in and of itself should not be news, but in this case, it is because the Trump administrators have been keeping reporters at bay for more than a week. In many ways, the Trump administration has been less transparent than its predecessors. Even those who thought the Obama administration never lived up to its ballyhooed promises of transparency, President Obama released his taxes, and President Trump has not released his.  President Trump shares literally nothing about who is coming to see him, he continued. President Obama golfed quite a bit, as does President Trump, but the Obama house would tell the public when he was hitting the links and with whom. This White House, for whatever reason, keeps that information private. Even the White House briefings are now shorter, with more   and a new trend of not allowing cameras or even audio recordings of what your White House is saying on any given day. People in power like to hide things from the public. We called it out under President Obama, and now it is empirically worse and more opaque.  Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
Fitton: Judicial Watch Pursues James Comey Records,Breitbart,Tom Fitton,6/20/2017,"The swamp creatures in Washington who gamed the system to appoint a special prosecutor need to be held accountable. [Judicial Watch is focusing on James Comey, the former FBI director who spirited away government documents, then arranged for the contents of those documents to be leaked to the media to force the appointment of a special prosecutor.  We aim to get the bottom of both the records removal and the leaks to the media, then hold accountable the persons involved.  Just today, we sued the Justice Department, which oversees the FBI, for a key Comey memo.  The lawsuit seeks access to a memorandum Comey wrote after a private meeting with President Trump regarding the pending investigation of Gen. Mike Flynn and potential Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election (Judicial Watch v. U. S. Department of Justice (No. 1:  )). We filed the suit here in D. C. after the Department of Justice failed to respond to our May 16 FOIA request: The memorandum written by former Director James Comey memorializing his meeting and conversation with President Trump regarding the FBIs investigation of potential Russian interference in the 2016 United States presidential election. For purposes of clarification, this memorandum was reportedly written on or about February 13, 2017 and is the subject of a New York Times article        dated May 16, 2017. The memo purportedly recounts a conversation between Trump and Comey about Flynn. Judicial Watch is pursuing six FOIA lawsuits (see here, here, here, here, here, and here) related to the surveillance and unmasking of President Trumps associates during the FBI investigation of potential Russian involvement and the subsequent leaking of information about that investigation to the media. Having to sue to get a document that was leaked to the New York Times is a scandal. The memo should be released forthwith, and, frankly, the president can and should order its immediate release. The lawsuit was only one of several significant actions we took this week. Yesterday, we sent acting FBI Director Andrew G. McCabe a letter reminding him about the FBIs legal obligation under the Federal Records Act (FRA) to recover records removed from the agency, including Comeys memos, apparently taken by Comey when he left the FBI and subsequently leaked them to the media. My June 14 letter states: As you are well aware, former FBI Director James Comey gave sworn testimony last week before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Among other things, Mr. Comey confirmed that, while in office, he created various memoranda regarding his meetings with President Trump. Mr. Comey also confirmed that, after his departure from the FBI, he provided at least some of these memoranda to a third party, Columbia Law School Professor Daniel Richman, for the purpose of leaking them to the press. Various media outlets now have reported that Professor Richman has provided these memoranda to the FBI. It is unclear whether he still retains copies of the memoranda. I am writing to you on behalf of Judicial Watch, Inc. a    educational organization that seeks to promote transparency, accountability, and integrity in government and fidelity to the rule of law. In furtherance of its public interest mission, Judicial Watch regularly requests access to the records of the FBI through the Freedom of Information Act and disseminates its findings to the public. In fact, on May 16, 2017, Judicial Watch submitted a FOIA request seeking these specific memoranda removed from the FBI by Mr. Comey. Judicial Watch also has pending FOIA lawsuits in which the memoranda may be at issue. These memoranda were created by Mr. Comey while serving as FBI director, were written on his FBI laptop, and concerned official government business. As such, they indisputably are records subject to the Federal Records Act. 44 U. S. C.        and  . The fact that Mr. Comey removed these memoranda from the FBI upon his departure, apparently for the purpose of subsequently leaking them to the press, confirms the FBIs failure to retain and properly manage its records in accordance with the Federal Records Act. Even if Mr. Comey no longer has possession of these particular memoranda, as he now claims, some or all of these memoranda may still be in possession of a third party, such as Professor Richman, and must be recovered. Mr. Comeys removal of these memoranda also suggests that other records may have been removed by Mr. Comey and may remain in his possession or in the possession of others. If so, these records must be recovered by the FBI as well. As you may be aware, the Federal Records Act imposes a direct responsibility on you to take steps to recover any records unlawfully removed from the FBI. Specifically, upon learning of any actual, impending, or threatened unlawful removal, defacing, alteration, corruption, deletion, erasure, or other destruction of records in the custody of the agency, you must notify the Archivist of the United States. 44 U.

Third Generation Pennsylvania Miner Face of Trumps End to War on Coal,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/20/2017,"The sun finally came out after a drenching rain storm in Pennsylvanias Alleghany Mountain country on the first day of the work week. It marked a symbolic development for the coal miners whose future is brighter thanks to President Donald Trumps efforts to revive an industry that the Obama administration had promised to all but abolish. [For Joey Kostya, that means he can continue a family tradition.  My father and my grandfather before me were miners, Kostya said after emerging from a shaft of the mine that broke ground just recently and was celebrated by Trump with Corsa Coal Corporation officials and other dignitaries overlooking the pit that reveals the rich vein of coal that runs beneath the rolling hills. Im absolutely thrilled to be speaking with you on this great, great day, Trump said via video. The miners of Pennsylvania are mining coal again. Washington may be 180 miles down the road, but I want you to know each and every day, Im fighting for you and all the forgotten men and women of America, Trump said. Kostya told Breitbart News that he thinks theres a future in coal now and hes glad to keep his job working in the mines. I like everything about it, Kostya said. Its a fun job.  Something different every day so it keeps it interesting  Kostya continued before donning his working gloves again and heading back into the mine. Under a tent perched hundreds of feet above a freshly dug coal pit, about 200 miners, business leaders, and politicians celebrated amid the surge of enthusiasm for the industry, the Associated Press reported on opening day.  Mining headgear lay atop red, white, and blue table cloths labeled Make Coal Great Again, AP reported. Indeed, the Acosta Deep Mine in Somerset County, Pennsylvania promises up to 100 jobs and an operation that will create countless tons of metallurgical coal, the ingredient used to make coke, the building block to produce steel     a commodity thats builds much of what America and the world uses, from buildings and bridges to technological devices. The mining will take place at this site over at least the next 15 years, revitalizing an area that was hard hit by the Obama energy policies. The miners will earn between $50, 000 and $100, 000 a year, according to the New York Post     a boon to an area where the median income is around $29, 000 a year. The underground mine will eventually stretch out for miles without so much as a blade of grass being disturbed on the lush farmland that dominates the region. Everyones excited about having a mine this big going in, Ben Gardner, mining engineer with Corsa Coal  the company that owns it, told Breitbart News. And the mine will not only benefit the miners and the local economy, but will have much broader economic impact felt far beyond the Keystone State, from the millions of dollars worth of   equipment used in the operation, to the transportation industry necessary to deliver the coal to its domestic and global destinations. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat who endorsed Hillary Clinton, said the state awarded a $3 million grant for the project. We have not always capitalized on our standing as one of the worlds leaders in these resources, but were changing that, Wolf said at the mines opening. Theres no official signage on the winding roads and picturesque farmland in this part of America, but theres no doubt this is Trump country. The war on coal is over, Corsa CEO George Dethlefsen said. Easing the regulatory burden, lowering taxes, stimulating infrastructure spending, balancing out the interest of economic growth versus environmental policy     its very good for coal.  Corsa hopes to open another metallurgical coal mine next year, and another mine in 2019."
"Delingpole: The Pause in Global Warming Is Real, Admits Climategate Scientist",Breitbart,James Delingpole,6/20/2017,"The Pause in global warming is real and the computer models predicting dramatically increased temperatures have failed. [This is the shocking admission of a paper published this week in Nature Geoscience. Its shocking because the papers lead author is none other than Ben Santer     one of the more vociferous and energetic alarmists exposed in the Climategate emails.  According to the papers abstract: In the early   century,   tropospheric warming trends were generally smaller than trends estimated from a large   ensemble. And: We conclude that model overestimation of tropospheric warming in the early   century is partly due to systematic deficiencies in some of the   external forcings used in the model simulations. Translation: the   temperature increases were much smaller than our spiffy, expensive computer models predicted. Its significance did not pass unnoticed by this veteran climate scientist: Wow! most early 21st century      model tropospheric warming is substantially larger than observed https:  .     @RyanMaue,     Roger A. Pielke Sr (@RogerAPielkeSr) June 19, 2017,  His surprise is understandable given that, previously, alarmist scientists like Ben Santer have gone to great lengths to deny the existence of a Pause in global warming, to pour scorn on those who have argued otherwise and to insist that their computer models are fundamentally reliable. Indeed, only last week the Spectator published an article by one such Pause Denier     a scientist from the University of East Anglia (ground zero of the Climategate scandal) fondly known as the University of Easy Access, named Phil Williamson. It is titled The Great Myth of the Global Warming Pause and it claims, somewhat imaginatively: The Paris agreement will be the future, whereas the     hiatus is already history. And lets not forget that in the dog days of the Obama administration, alarmist scientists were so desperate to pooh pooh the Pause in the run up to the Paris climate talks that they concocted a junk science paper     now the subject of a federal investigation     which used dodgy data to try to airbrush the Pause out of history. Truly, as the Daily Caller notes, the alarmists   on this subject has of late been remarkable. Do they believe in the Pause (or hiatus as they sometimes term it) or dont they? Santer recently   a separate paper that purported to debunk statements EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt made that global warming had leveled off.  But Santers paper only evaluated a   and    portion of Pruitts statement by removing the term hiatus.  Moreover, climate scientists mocked Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz for talking about the global warming hiatus during a 2015 congressional hearing. Instead, activist scientists worked hard to airbrush the global warming slowdown from data records and advance media claim that it was a myth.  Santer and Carl Mears, who operate the Remote Sensing System satellite temperature dataset, authored a lengthy blog post in 2016 critical of Cruzs contention there was an   hiatus in warming that climate models didnt predict. The fact that Ben Santer is involved in this embarrassing retraction     his admission on the Pause is bad enough, but what the paper says about the unreliability of the computer models is breathtaking in its implications     will be particularly piquant to those who remember his prominent role in the Climategate emails. Santer revealed himself to be one of the nastier and more aggressive members of Michael Manns Hockey team when he emailed one of his colleagues: Next time I see Pat Michaels at a scientific meeting, Ill be tempted to beat the crap out of him. Very tempted. (Climatologist Pat Michaels, now of the Cato Institute, incurred Santers wrath by being one of the first climate scientists to pour cold water on Catastrophic Anthropogenic Global Warming theory. In other words, Michaels made the disgusting,   error of using actual science and being right). But perhaps Santers lowest point was the occasion where he effectively hijacked one of the early IPCC Assessment Reports and ramped up the scaremongering in a way that had rather more to do with political activism than it did to science. I describe it in my book Watermelons: Ben who? Well quite. Unless his name rings a bell as the guy from the Climategate emails who wanted to beat the crap out of climate sceptic Pat Michaels, you almost certainly wont have heard of him. Yet in the   this climate modeling nonenity was somehow placed in the extraordinary position of being able to dictate world opinion on global warming at the stroke of a pen. He achieved this in his role as lead author of Chapter 8 of the scientific working group report on the IPCCs Second Assessment Report (SAR). Nothing to write home about there, you might think, except that Santer was personally responsible for by far the most widely reported sentence in the entire report: the one from the Summary for Policy Makers (the only part of the IPCCs Assessment Report most people actually bother to read) claiming the balance of evidence suggests that there is a discernible human influence on global climate.  But was this line actually true? Was this really a fair summary     the kind of summary the IPCC purports rigorously and definitively to give of us     of the general state of scientific understanding at that particular moment? Er, well not according to some of the scientists whod contributed to that chapter of the report, no. The original version of the chapter     as agreed on and signed off by all 28 contributing authors     expressed considerably more doubt about AGW than was indicated in Santers summary. It included these passages: None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.  No study to date has positively attributed all or part (of the climate change observed) to ( ) causes.  Any claims of positive detection and attribution of significant climate change are likely to remain controversial until uncertainties in the total natural variability of the climate system are reduced.  When will an anthropogenic climate be identified? It is not surprising that the best answer to the question is We do not know.  Strangely, none of these passages made it to the final draft. They were among 15 deleted after the event by Santer, who also inserted a phrase entirely of his own to the effect that the body of statistical evidence now points to a discernible human influence on climate.  In other words the chapter did not represent the consensus position reached by 28 scientists. What it in fact represented was the scientifically unsupported opinion of one man, Benjamin D Santer. We climate rationalists do still get an awful lot of stick from the alarmists for our old fashioned belief that scientists should stick to the evidence and use actual data rather than plucking stuff from thin air based on their fanciful notions of what ought to be true or what might get them more  . How delightful it is to have it confirmed     albeit in the arid language of a science paper     that yet again are 100 percent correct."
#RESIST as Marketing: Fearless Girl Statue Taking Home Awards at Cannes - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/20/2017,"The Fearless Girl statue which stands opposite of the iconic charging bull on Wall Street is racking up awards this week at Cannes Lions, the largest annual gathering of marketing executives. [The statue was commissioned on behalf of asset manager State Street and advertising agency McCann New York as a way of encouraging firms to hire more female executives.  Its simplicity in the use of symbolism transcends geography, it transcends language, it transcends culture, Wendy Clark, CEO of DDB North America, told Adweek. For us, while it is a girl, it elegantly captures womens journeys and our path to empowerment. And it also encapsulates our hopes and our ambitions for every little girl in the world.  Clark also serves as the jury president of the Cannes Lions awards week, which was inspired by the Cannes Film Festival and takes place at the same conference center in Cannes, France. The Fearless Girl statue took home the Grand Prix in the Glass, PR and Outdoor Lions categories on the festivals first day. The statue was sculpted by artist Kristen Visbal in an effort to encourage gender diversity amongst corporate executives. The girl is standing there like this in front the bull, saying, Now, what are you going to do?  Arturo Di Modica said, who sculpted the Charging Bull statue. Di Modica argues that the Fearless Girl statue violates his artistic rights as it changes the meaning of the bull statue. Remove her and place her somewhere else in the city, Di Modicas attorney said. Weve got lots of ideas. And damages must be awarded to Arturo for violation of his legal, statutory rights.

Lawsuit Claims San Francisco State University Exhibits Pattern of Anti-Jewish Animus,Breitbart,Breitbart Jerusalem,6/20/2017,"The Algemeiner reports: San Francisco State University (SFSU) was hit by a lawsuit on Monday brought by students and local community members accusing the school of an extremely disturbing and consistent pattern of   animus. [Claiming that SFSU has allowed a hostile environment toward Jews since at least 1968, when the social   College of Ethnic Studies was established, the plaintiffs said that the situation has only gotten worse over time and that SFSU and its administrators have knowingly fostered this.  The plaintiffs include two current students, one recent graduate and three members of the local Jewish community, represented in part by attorneys from the Lawfare Project, a   legal think tank.  All of the plaintiffs attended the April 2016 lecture by Jerusalem Mayor Nir Barkat, which was dramatically disrupted by students, including members of the SFSU student group General Union of Palestine Students (GUPS) who allegedly made incessant threats and amplified chants, including shouting, Get the f*** off our campus! and Intifada!

Speaker Paul Ryan Lays Out His Tax Reform Plan,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/20/2017,"Speaker of the House Paul Ryan ( ) turned his attention to tax reform Tuesday as he addressed a meeting of the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM). [We are going to fix this nations tax code once and for all, the speaker said to the NAMs Manufacturing Summit in Washington, DC.  After describing with dismay the complexities and uncertainties of the current tax code, Ryan launched into some specifics of his plan for reform. First, we will eliminate harmful taxes including the death tax and the alternative minimum tax, he said. Next, we will clear out special interest   and expensive deductions, Ryan continued, explaining that the home mortgage, retirement, and charitable giving deductions would not be on the chopping block. Seven current individual tax brackets would be reduced to three, with the savings from discontinued deductions and streamlining allowing lower tax rates. Ryan promised a postcard sized income tax form would be possible under the plan. Americas 35 percent corporate tax rate came into Ryans crosshairs, which he compared to Canadas 15 percent. Ryan partly blamed this tax rate, along with high individual rates for businesses that filed that way, for widespread offshoring of American jobs. We cannot accept a system that perpetuates the drain of American businesses overseas, he said. The solution, according to Ryan, is a move to a territorial system that allows American companies to move cash from overseas into the country without being taxed. This promise smacked of similarity to the Border Adjustment Tax concept that has caused controversy in earlier Republican tax reform proposals under Ryans speakership. Shortly before taking office, President Donald Trump expressed his objections to the concept to the Wall Street Journal. In setting the stage, Ryan touted as legislative successes his caucuss use of the Congressional Review act, more than a dozen times, to roll back administrative state regulations, before promoting the American Health Care Act (AHCA) the one major bill passed by House Republicans during President Trumps administration. The AHCA faces an unclear fate in the Senate. Ryan had made clear in the past he was waiting for the House to pass a healthcare bill before moving on taxes. With the House having done so last month, Ryan appeared to be moving forward with plans to introduce tax legislation regardless of how that bill, the AHCA, fares in the Senate. Shortly after the AHCAs passage, Ryan spoke to New York Citys AM 970 about tax reform prospects, saying, We are convinced that we can get this done in 2017 so that the economy can really start to take off.        All the planets are aligned, meaning you have the House, the Senate and the White House all working on this plan together.  At the start of the month, House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows told a crowd at the conservative Heritage Institute that he would push for Congresss August recess to be canceled if a tax bill has not been passed by then. Speaker Ryan seemed to echo that sentiment Tuesday, saying tax reform would move full speed ahead but set a later deadline of the end of the year: You will hear that tax reform is coming along. You will hear that it is dead. Then you will hear it is back on track. Then you will hear it is on life support. Sometimes you will hear all of this in the same week, the same day, or heck, even the same hour. Do not be surprised by any of it. But I am here to tell you: We are going to get this done in 2017. We need to get this done in 2017. We cannot let this     moment slip by. Ryan promised that any bill his Caucus introduces will insist on changes to the tax code."

"Fred Fleitz: If Dems Continue Pointless Trump Investigations, Congress Should Investigate Hillary Clintons Criminal Activity",Breitbart,Dan Riehl,6/20/2017,"Senior Vice President for Policy and Programs at the Center for Security Policy and former CIA analyst, Fred Fleitz, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss the death of Otto Warmbier just days after returning from North Korea and the possibility of Loretta Lynch testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee. [Fleitz said hes still hopeful that there could be an investigation into Loretta Lynch, I really hope so, he said, because that was the criminal activity of the 2016 campaign. Why was the law not enforced concerning the Clinton email server, the mishandling of classified information, the Clinton Foundation, and what I think are numerous instances of foreign governments trying to buy influence with a prospective president?  There are clear instances of    with the Clinton Foundation, he continued. The email server broke so many laws. If I had done a small fraction of the things connected with that incident Id have lost my job, Id have enormous legal bills and frankly, I think Id be serving prison time.  Fleitz added that he hopes Lynch and other Obama officials are questioned by the Senate. Said Fleitz of the Democrats, If theyre going to pursue this route, this relentless series of pointless and false investigations of President Trump, lets investigate Hillary Clinton and all the criminal activity that she is clearly responsible for.  As regards American college student Otto Warmbier, Fleitz Said, This is just such a terrible story. The North Korean government murdered this young man. They murdered him. And we know that North Korea is a criminal regime. But what Im very angry about is how the Obama administration did almost nothing to get him back.  There were no consular visits, Fleitz continued, which are required under international law by the state representing us, Sweden, to check on him while he was in prison. There were none.  Fleitz continued to blast the Obama administration for dropping the ball. A young man who was his hotel roommate before he was arrested, hes a British citizen, says the Obama administration never contacted him to find out the particulars of why he was arrested. The Obama administration said to the Warmbier family, stay silent, do nothing, and the Obama administration pursued their idiotic policy of strategic patience, which we now know was an utter failure.

Senator Chuck Grassley: Free Speech Is Under Assault on College Campuses - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/20/2017,"Senator Chuck Grassley ( ) condemned American universities for stifling free speech during a congressional hearing on Tuesday.[  Higher education rests on the free flow of ideas, Grassley began, reading from prepared remarks. Education requires that positions be held tentatively, tested by opposing arguments that are rationally considered, and evaluated.  All colleges, therefore, must protect free speech.  Public institutions must adhere to the various guarantees of the First Amendment.  The judiciary committee heard testimonies from several witnesses on Tuesday about the state of free speech on American college campuses. Grassley argued that free speech has been sacrificed in the name of political correctness. He condemned administrators for shielding students from hate speech.  But on too many campuses today, free speech appears to be sacrificed at the altar of political correctness.  Many administrators believe that students should be shielded from hate speech, whatever that is, as an exception to the First Amendment.  Unfortunately, this censorship is no different from any other examples in history, when speech that authorities deemed to be heretical has been suppressed based on its content. The hearing comes in the aftermath of chaos at Evergreen State College, where biology professor Bret Weinstein faced demands for his termination after he dared to disagree with the facultys progressive orthodoxy. The Washington State Senate committee discussed the state of public safety at Evergreen during a Tuesday hearing. The entirety of Senator Grassleys prepared remarks can be read below: Higher education rests on the free flow of ideas.  Education requires that positions be held tentatively, tested by opposing arguments that are rationally considered, and evaluated.  All colleges therefore must protect free speech.  Public institutions must adhere to the various guarantees of the First Amendment. Too often, all of these fundamental principles have been under assault.  Even worse, some people who have exercised their First Amendment rights have been themselves assaulted.  As a result, those who would curtail free speech have been emboldened and those who disagree with the prevailing orthodoxy have been censored or chilled from speaking freely.  There is no point in having a student body on campus if competing ideas are not exchanged and analyzed. At Kellogg Community College, administrators required prior approval for speech in public forums, a   violation of the First Amendment.  Amazingly, students there were arrested for distributing copies of the United States Constitution.  Their lawsuit against the college and against its administrators in their personal capacity is pending. Many students erroneously think that speech that they consider hateful is violent.  Yet some students engage in acts of violence against speech, and universities have failed to prevent or adequately punish that violence.  At the University of California Berkeley, two invited speakers were prevented from speaking due to mob violence and other projected safety concerns that the University failed to control.  That university should be reminded of a passage in one of the Supreme Courts most important First Amendment rulings: If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics      .   A lawsuit has been brought that alleges that Berkeley has systemically and intentionally suppressed speech protected by the First Amendment because its viewpoint differs from that of university administrators. At Middlebury College, the eminent scholar Dr. Charles Murray was at first shouted down from speaking, then when the event was moved, students pulled the fire alarm to prevent him from speaking.  It was not Dr. Murray, but the students, who essentially falsely yelled fire in a crowded theater.  The Middlebury professor who moderated the debate was physically assaulted, and has yet to fully recover from her serious injuries.  It was not a mere handful of students, but a mob, who engaged in such appalling conduct at an institution theoretically devoted to rationality and intellectualism.  Not including those who were not captured on video, the college disciplined more than 70 students.  But none was expelled or even suspended.  As a practical matter, most students received no more serious punishment than the double secret probation immortalized in film.  As Dr. Murray noted, such weak punishment will not deter any future student disruptions, The First Amendment is clear.  The Supreme Court has decided that offensive speech is protected, that speech cannot be restricted based on viewpoint, that public forums must be places where free speech rights can be exercised, and that prior restraints on speech are highly disfavored.  Otherwise, any speech that anyone found offensive could be suppressed.  Little free speech would survive.  And as Justice Holmes said, If there is any principle of the Constitution that more imperatively calls from attachment than any other it is the principle of free thought, not free thought for those who agree with us but freedom for the thought that we hate.  But on too many campuses today, free speech appears to be sacrificed at the altar of political correctness.  Many administrators believe that students should be shielded from hate speech, whatever that is, as an exception to the First Amendment.  Unfortunately, this censorship is no different from any other examples in history, when speech that authorities deemed to be heretical has been suppressed based on its content.  Even more unfortunate, this   attitude is so pervasive that students are being socialized and possibly indoctrinated into favoring censorship at odds with the First Amendment.  A recent Gallup poll found that students by   margin believe that it is desirable to restrict the use of slurs and other language intentionally offensive to certain groups.  And by a   margin, they favor restricting expression of political views that are upsetting or offensive to certain groups. College students vote.  Not only academia, but our democracy depends on the ability to try to advocate to inform or to change minds.  When universities suppress speech, they not only damage freedom today, they establish and push norms harmful to democracy going forward.  These restrictions may cause and exacerbate the political polarization that is so widely lamented in our society. Whatever the nature of the speech being suppressed, I am concerned.  However, prominent liberal university administrators admit that the vast amount of disfavored speech is on the conservative side of the spectrum.  Harvard President Drew Fausts recent commencement address, which I will put in the record, noted the lack of conservative ideas on campus.  And as former Stanford Provost John Etchemendy has observed, [T]here is a growing intolerance at universities . . . . a political   that is the antithesis of what universities should stand for.   And he fears that university administrators will take the easy route of giving in to student pressure to restrict debate.  I ask consent to include his excellent remarks in the record as well. Dr. Etchemendys fears are being realized.  In a recent interview, the President of Northwestern University undercut the apparent lip service he paid to the First Amendment.  Rather than making students confront the speech that makes them uncomfortable, he advocated making students feel comfortable by ensuring a safe space where they will not hear it.  Even worse, when asked whether he would be comfortable were the speakers shouted down at Middlebury and Berkeley to speak at Northwestern, he replied that he would permit their appearances on a    basis.   No.  The First Amendment does not permit arbitrary prior restraints on speech by university administrators on a case by case basis.  That is an open invitation to discriminate based on viewpoint.  That is where too many colleges are right now.  Any great university would welcome numerous speakers whose positions made the President and many others on campus uncomfortable. Some may advocate legislation in this area.  Theoretically, private colleges that accept federal funds could be subject to individual private lawsuits when free speech rights, including religious free speech rights, are violated.  Some may even suggest an analogue to section 1983.  Under that approach, officials of private universities that accept federal funds would be subject to individual private rights of action for damages if they violate free speech or fail to train university officials and campus police to adhere to the First Amendment. Fortunately, not all schools adopt the censorship approach.  The University of Chicago has adopted a policy that some other universities have followed, which I will also put in the record.  This policy prohibits the university from suppressing speech that even most people on campus would find offensive or immoral.  It calls for   rather than suppression by people who disagree with speech.  And while protecting protest, it expressly prohibits obstruct[ing] or otherwise interfer[ing] with the freedom of others to express views they reject or even loathe.   Finally, it commits the university to actively protect that freedom when others attempt to restrict it.  The Committee has assembled a distinguished panel to speak on this important subject.  I welcome them all. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

Some smaller regional jets cannot take off in temperatures hotter than 117 degrees, it said in a statement.  Our smaller regional operations    those that use our CRJ aircraft types    will be most affected by the heat, the airlines communication specialist Kent Powell told CNN. We really arent expecting any change to the operation with our mainline aircraft. Because hotter air is thinner, planes also need more speed to take off and, thus, require more runway. Sky Harbors runways are long enough to accommodate most planes in hot weather, American Airlines said.  2. Heat records are being shattered,    In Phoenix, the 118 degrees on Monday tied the record set exactly a year ago.     On Sunday, several Northern California cities    including Sacramento (106 degrees) San Jose (103 degrees) and San Francisco (88 degrees)    saw record hot temperatures.     The   continued Monday with Sacramento hitting 107 degrees, a step hotter than its   record from 1988. It could get even hotter on Wednesday, with a forecast temperature of 109 degrees.    On Monday, Stockton, California, saw a record high of 109 degrees and Lancaster in southern part of the state had 110 degrees.  3. Wildfires are burning, Firefighters across California are battling several fires, including one near Big Bear spreading to 950 acres. They dealt with a grass fire in Sacramento that broke out during Mondays evening commute.  Cal Fire warned of high fire danger with hot and dry conditions.  4. Power is being knocked out, Power outages have been reported over the last few days in Californias Central Valley, the Bay Area and southern parts of the state.  As temperatures increase, more people turn on air conditioners, which use a lot of electricity and can strain the power system. 5. Roads buckle under the heat  The heat couldve been a factor as four lanes of Highway 50 in West Sacramento began to buckle on Sunday. Drivers reported the giant cracks forming on the road and the lanes were repaired, reported CNN affiliate KGO. How to beat the heat, Heat kills more people in the United States than any other type of weather, so take precautions.  Hot car deaths are a consistent problem, If you cant avoid being outside and staying close to air conditioning, here are some ways to beat the heat:    Never leave your car locked or unattended without checking for pets and children inside.   Hydrate with water, avoiding sugary drinks and alcohol.   Wear   clothing, which can hold down your body temperature several degrees.   Wear sunscreen SPF 15 or higher to protect your skin from harmful UV rays.   Dont forget to check on neighbors, friends and family, especially the young and the elderly, who are at more risk of heath damage from excessive heat."
Rowan University Guidebook Claims Meritocracy Is a Microaggression - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,6/20/2017,"Rowan University has published a guide for their professors instructing them how to call out supposed microaggressions in the classroom, with ideas such as meritocracy and wanting to be inclusive highlighted as especially negative. [Interrupting Microaggressions, which is available on the Rowan University Bias  Response Team (BART) website, has a section entitled The Myth of Meritocracy, which states that arguingeveryone can succeed in this country, if they work hard enough, is in fact not a reflection on the social mobility of America but a microaggression that could easily hurt the feelings of students.  Colour blindness, the idea that someone does not believe in race when dealing with people and treats everyone equally regardless, is also listed as a problematic idea. The speaker should be asked to articulate what they do believe in instead, according to the guide. The same applies to inclusivity in regards to gender. A quote from the guide details the philosophy of the university in dealing with microaggressions: At Rowan University efforts to provide a respectful, inclusive learning environment and community are dependent on everyones ability to recognize, respond to, and prevent   incidents       As a [professor] you have an obligation to take an active role in fostering an appreciation for diversity and sending the message loud and clear that   acts will not be tolerated. Along with the full guide published by the university, the website contains links to other resources on the subject, including a video by Fusion Comedy that compares microaggressions to mosquito bites, and an article by Everyday Feminism that tells prospective allies to help minorities and oppressed people by talking less.  A separate document entitled Tips for Interrupting Bias is designed to assist those called out for their microaggressions, which offers helpful advice such as taking responsibility for and acknowledging your own behavior and to be mindful to avoid their natural defensive tendencies when they are criticized.

Declassified NSA Documents Show Poor Digital Security Practices - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/20/2017,"Recently declassified NSA documents show a worrying lack of attention to digital security at the National Security Agency. [The declassified document obtained under a Freedom Of Information Act (FOIA) request by the New York Times, outlines a number of security measures taken by the NSA to secure their digital documents and systems. According to the report, the NSA regularly left physical server stacks completely unsecured and open to tampering, did not use   authentication in many of their digital systems and did not use access control lists to verify which users should have access to sensitive information.  While much of the report is redacted, information related to the poor security practices of the NSA can still be found. The declassified security review was conducted following the leak of over one million NSA files by Edward Snowden between 2012 and 2013. The report states that the NSA did not have guidance concerning key management and did not consistently secure server racks and other sensitive equipment in the data centers and machine rooms in accordance with their    initiative. Data centers were also left unsecured as   access controls were not implemented at the time of the report. Similarly,   authentication had not been rolled out to all   access users either. The report states that far too many NSA employees had administrator privileges, meaning they could make direct changes to NSA systems without approval from   within the organization. These administrator accounts were also poorly monitored according to the report, and the number of NSA employees that were given permissions to perform data transfers had not been lowered in an attempt to secure data. In three separate NSA facilities, in Texas, Utah, and North Carolina State University, the team conducting the security audit observed unlocked server racks and sensitive equipment, leaving data extremely easy to access. The declassified document further states that the NSA did not keep accurate and detailed documentation that identified its methodology for completing each initiative, and did not describe how it measured the initiatives completeness and effectiveness.  This means that these security vulnerabilities were still present within NSA systems up until August of 2016. The NSA will reportedly take the findings of the security audit into consideration while tightening their internal security, but due to the heavily redacted nature of the declassified document, it is hard to determine what the NSA plans to do about their network security.

"Foreign Guest Workers Increasing under Trump, Say Fed Data",Breitbart,John Binder,6/20/2017,"President Donald Trumps administration has seen increases in the number of foreign workers entering the U. S. according to new federal statistics. [Numbers from the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) show that in the Trump Administrations first three months in office, the number of foreign workers who were given permission to enter the U. S. increased by nearly 25, 000 compared to the same time last year under the Obama Administration.  Between January and March 2016, Obama admitted more than 112, 000 foreign guest workers. In 2017, Trump allowed close to 137, 000 foreign workers to enter the country. Every year, hundreds of thousands of foreign workers are given permission by the federal government to enter the U. S. through a variety of   foreign guest worker visas, including the       and   visas. Often, Americans are fired and replaced by foreigners, as companies can pay the foreign replacement a lesser salary under the visas rules. This has left millions of Americans displaced as they see their jobs eventually transferred to a foreign nation. This year, the Department for Professional Employees estimated how foreign workers continue to increase in a multitude of American industries: Guest workers are highly concentrated in STEM occupations. Guest workers were 14. 2 percent of the computer and mathematical science workforce in the United States 6. 7 percent of the architecture and engineering workforce and 10. 5 percent of the life, physical, and social science workforce in 2016. Further, guest workers made up 24. 9 percent of software developers, 13. 3 percent of computer programmers, 17. 4 percent of computer hardware engineers, 20. 6 percent of computer and information research scientists, and 14. 6 percent of mathematicians, statisticians and miscellaneous math occupations in the United States in 2016. The highest concentration of guest workers in STEM occupations was among medical scientists and life scientists where guest workers were 28. 5 percent of the workforce in 2016. [35] All of these guest workers are employed under a variety of skilled worker visas, including the B,       O, and OPT. Though the Trump Administration campaigned against the   visa, which is responsible for a number of   of American workers at Disney, IBM and Carnival Corporation, it is possible that his administration had little control over the increase in foreign workers. The reality is, I dont even think Trump runs that department yet,   expert John Miano told Breitbart Texas. Its ridiculous.  Trumps nominee to run USCIS, Lee Francis Cissna, is a friend to immigration hawks who want to see less foreign nationals taking American jobs. Seems that the Trump Administration is fighting inertia here, Miano said. As Breitbart Texas reported, nearly 55, 000 illegal aliens were given Temporary Protected Status (TPS) in Trumps first three months in office. Critics blasted TPS as being an indirect amnesty system.

Donald Trump Meets Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko After Sanctioning Russian-Backed Separatists,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/20/2017,"President Donald Trump met with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on Tuesday as his administration imposed sanctions on   separatists in the country. [Trump said the two had very, very good discussions, calling Ukraine a place that weve all been very much involved in.   Behind the scenes, the White House revealed that Trump and Poroshenko discussed support for a peaceful resolution to the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced sanctions on two Russian officials and several separatists in Eastern Ukraine to support the Ukrainian amidst ongoing   conflicts in the region. This administration is committed to a diplomatic process that guarantees Ukrainian sovereignty, and there should be no sanctions relief until Russia meets its obligations under the Minsk agreements, Mnuchin said Tuesday. Poroshenko said it was a great pleasure to meet with Trump to discuss issues important to Ukraine and called the president a supporter and strategic partner of the country. Were really fighting for freedom and democracy, he said."
Donald Trump: China Effort on North Korea Has Not Worked Out - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/20/2017,"President Donald Trump appears disappointed in Chinas efforts to stop continued aggression from North Korea. [While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi  China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out, he wrote on Twitter on Tuesday afternoon. At least I know China tried!  After meeting with President Xi Jinping in April, Trump appeared optimistic that China would help   North Koreas actions in the region, even stalling some of his aggressive actions on trade. Look, Ive been talking about China for years, he told Fox News host Martha MacCallum during an interview. Now, I speak nicely about China because I really do believe theyre trying to help out with respect to North Korea.  Trump also addressed reports of North Korea launching missiles in May, asserting that China was trying hard to get them to stop. Trumps new focus on North Korea might have been sparked by the death of Otto Warmbier     an American student who died, despite coming home to the United States after spending more than a year in a coma in a North Korean prison. Its a total disgrace what happened to Otto, Trump said on Tuesday. It should never, ever be allowed to happen. And frankly, if he were brought home sooner, I think the results would have been a lot different."
German Police Accused of Covering up Child Rape in Asylum Home,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/20/2017,"Police and the local government in Herford, Germany, have been accused of covering up the rape of a child at an asylum home for almost two weeks. [The alleged rape occurred two weeks ago at the former British Harewood Barracks which was recently converted into an asylum shelter. The man accused of the rape, a Ghanian of unknown age, is said to have sexually abused a    girl originally from a former Soviet republic, local newspaper   reports.  The    is said to have been raped so brutally she had to be taken to a nearby hospital. Senior prosecutor Udo Vennewald said: He is a man from Ghana. Weve got a warrant, and the man is sitting behind bars.  The man has since been charged with the sexual abuse of a minor. Though his asylum claim is independent of the case, he is unlikely to receive a positive decision as only 3. 4 per cent of Ghanaians are accepted for asylum. Fearing revenge attacks once the news of the rape became widely known, police recommended many of the Africans in the asylum centre should move to a different facility. The local government rejected the proposal.   Rrig, the independent commissioner for Issues of Child Sexual Abuse for the German Federal Government, has warned since 2015 of the vulnerability of children in asylum homes. No accurate figures exist for the number of children abused. The total number of sex abuse cases in North   in which asylum seekers were the victims totalled 119 cases in 2016, though no record of the age of the victims is kept. There have been several cases in which asylum seekers have abused underage children in asylum homes, not only in Germany but also in other countries like Sweden. In one particular case, a group of Afghan migrants brutally assaulted a boy both sexually and physically and filmed the entire ordeal in the Swedish city of Uppsala. In other cases, migrants have sexually assaulted minors outside of asylum homes, most notably in swimming pools and outdoor festivals. Earlier this month, several Syrian asylum seekers were arrested in Lbau after filming underage girls at an outdoor swimming pool and sexually molesting them. The men involved were aged 19 to 30 years old. Underage migrants in asylum homes face physical harm from adult migrants, as well. A case in Arnschwang this month saw a    Afghan migrant stab a    child to death before being shot by police."

"Mayoral Candidate Paul Massey:New YorkIs Terror Target Number One, Time to Get Proactive",Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/20/2017,"NEW YORK     New York City is target number one for terrorist organizations and the citys security services must prepare by becoming more proactive, contended NYC Republican mayoral candidate Paul Massey in an interview. [Massey slammed his opponent, Mayor Bill de Blasio, for maintaining a challenging relationship with the New York Police Department (NYPD) resulting, Massey argued, in a breakdown of respect for the mayors office among police officers.  Massey was speaking during an onstage interview at the JBiz Expo, an annual business networking and   event hosted by the Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce. Asked what he would do to enhance counterterror measures for NYC, a city this reporter contended was the top target for worldwide Islamic terrorist groups, Massey replied: Id say I thoroughly agree with you that we are target number one and we have to act like it. Prior administrations were very proactive. First of all, we have the best police force in the country. NYPD are fantastic. They have a challenging relationship with our current mayor. I think that there is an issue of a breakdown of respect there. Massey referred to a survey last March that found a whopping 96 percent of NYPD cops had an unfavorable opinion of de Blasio. And he brought up another poll, conducted by the Patrolmens Benevolent Association, which found that 87 percent of NYPD officers believe the city is less safe under de Blasio. That goes to the inherent disrespect between them and the mayor, he said of the findings. And everybody in New York City feels that and it is very disconcerting.  Regarding proposed counterterror measures for the city, Massey stated: That being said, I want to focus on what the NYPD is doing to proactively address potential terrorist threats. Prior administrations had NYPD active in other hot markets around the world. Listening, looking, cooperating with federal forces other countries intelligence organizations. We need to be proactive about our   activity and we need to have a mindset that we are a target and we have to keep safe. Massey is a businessman who founded Massey Knakal Realty, a successful real estate firm that does business across NYCs five boroughs. His campaign website touts Massey as the leader New York City needs to bring integrity back to our government and turn our city around.

Gr-r-reat? Why Amazons Whole Foods Deal Will Hurt Kellogg And Similar Brands - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/20/2017,"Market analysts are anticipating an increase in fresh food sales as a result of the   Foods merger, according to a CNBC report. [Such a shift in the market would hurt brands like General Mills and Kellogg, according to the report. The transition from a mixed emphasis on processed and fresh foods to a greater emphasis on fresh products will hurt brands like Kellogg, who focus almost exclusively on processed foods.  I would say its the smaller brands that are going to be most affected. Conagra and the midtier companies are probably going to be the most hurt. Theres probably a lot of independent brands that are owned privately around the country that have the least pricing power and will be hit hard by this, Bernstein analyst Alexia Howard told CNBC. Its not good news for the cereal companies, but its generally not good news for packaged companies.  Shares of Kellogg Company and General Mills declined sharply when the   Foods   was announced. Market trends suggest that consumers are moving away from processed foods and towards fresh products. Analysts suggest that the   Foods merger will serve to accelerate this market shift. Shifts in the retail environment, particularly in North America, may pose risks broadly for   processed food manufacturers, including General Mills. Consumers continue to drive away from processed foods, wrote Piper Jaffray analyst Michael Lavery ahead of the merger. We expect continued downward pressure on pricing from intense retail competition, driven by retailers like Walmart, Aldi and Lidl and online retailers, too.  Other analysts have credited online information with inspiring the move away from processed foods, which many now argue are bad for the consumers health. Bernstein analysis Alexia Howard claimed that consumers have developed a mistrust of legacy brands such as General Mills as a result of online dialogue on the health ramifications of eating processed foods. Thats allowing new challengers or small brands gaining market share, and youre seeing a fragmentation of the industry. Consumers, particularly mothers of small children, have started to talk about whats in our food, said Howard. Its created a distrust of the legacy products. Thats whats reduced barriers to entry and allow a lot of new brands to come up, and thats another big challenge.  As the food market evolves, processed food companies like General Mills and Kellogg may be forced to shift the focus of their production to introduce some fresh food offerings. Kellogg announced in November that it was pulling ads from Breitbart. com because its 45, 000, 000 monthly conservative readers were not aligned with our values as a company.  In response, Breitbart News, one of the worlds top news publishers, launched a #DumpKelloggs petition and called for a boycott of the ubiquitous food manufacturer. Shares of Kellogg have declined by 9. 3 percent since the #DumpKelloggs campaign began. Tom Ciccotta is a libertarian who writes about economics and higher education for Breitbart News.

London Attack Suspect: Pub Fights and Anti-Muslim Rants,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/20/2017,"LONDON (AFP)     The    accused of driving a van into a crowd of Muslim worshippers outside a London mosque is troubled according to his family, while those who know him describe a man who has verbally abused Muslim children. [Darren Osborne, a father of four from Cardiff in Wales, was arrested after the attack near Finsbury Park Mosque early Monday and is being questioned by police on suspicion of attempted murder and terrorism.  According to witnesses who detained the man before police arrested him, he was shouting that he wanted to kill all Muslims before he was taken away. Neighbours said Osborne had been thrown out of The Hollybush, his local pub in Pentwyn, a suburb of Cardiff, on Saturday for drunkenly insulting Muslims. He was cursing Muslims and saying he would do some damage, according to a regular at the pub quoted by The Sun. His Muslim neighbour, Khadijeh Sherizi, said she had never had any problems with Osborne until this weekend, when he insulted her children. Her son Nadeem, 12, was quoted in The Guardian as saying: I was on my bike and he just came up to me and said inbred.  His sister Nadia, 10, said she and her grandmother had heard Osborne using the same word. All of a sudden we heard him say inbred. Other neighbours said that Osbornes behaviour had become erratic in recent weeks, and that he was living in a tent in the woods after splitting up with his   partner. Around two weeks ago I saw him and he was a right state, Peter Mackuin, 53, told The Sun. His missus had been out looking for him, I saw him wandering out of the woods.      Too much trouble     Sherizi told AFP of her shock when she recognised the suspect, saying: I saw him on the news and I thought, Oh my God, that is my neighbour. He has been so normal. He was in his kitchen yesterday afternoon singing with his kids.  His mother Christine, 72, said she screamed when she saw her son in television footage. My son is no terrorist     hes just a man with problems, The Sun quoted her as saying. In a statement on behalf of the family, his nephew Ellis Osborne, 26, said: We are massively shocked. Our hearts go out to the people who have been injured.  His uncle was not a racist he said, adding: Its madness. It is obviously sheer madness.  Darrens sister Nicola added that the suspect had shown no interest in politics, telling The Sun: He wouldnt even know who the prime minister was.  Some neighbours described a normal but loud character. I know him. Ive lived here for five years, he was already living here when I moved in, said    Saleem Naema. If I ever needed anything he would come. I just cant believe that he did that. I am a Muslim.  But others described a man who attracted trouble, and who often argued in the street with his wife. Hes quite a shouty person, always shouting at his wife and kids, pharmacist Rebecca Carpenter told The Times. Osborne was reportedly born in Singapore and is believed to have moved to Wales from    in west England. Locals in    told the Times newspaper that he had left because he was too much trouble frequently getting into pub fights."
Exclusive - Paul Nehlen: Paul Ryan Has Zero Manufacturing Credibility - Breitbart,Breitbart,Paul Nehlen,6/20/2017,"Its been reported that Speaker Ryan is going to speak to a room full of manufacturing leaders at the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) today. Ryans office is billing as his first major address on tax reform this year, and that Ryan will participate in a    session afterward. [This should be interesting.  Paul Ryan has zero experience with manufacturing. There is not one instance of Ryan ever holding a job managing manufacturing operations tasked with competing against local or foreign manufacturers. However, Ive run heavily engineered manufacturing businesses around the globe. So Ill take this opportunity to pose a few questions for Speaker Ryan that those in attendance might think about asking him: Its been reported Ryan will say something to the effect of, With more jobs, higher wages, and a stronger economy, American workers and families would be the greatest beneficiaries of this reform, Ryans office said. Thats why, following the principles outlined earlier this year by President Trump, the House, Senate, and administration are working together to meet this historic opportunity.  Does Paul Ryan realize that foreign manufacturers will flock to the U. S. when the Corporate tax rate is dropped to 15 percent? Does Paul Ryan realize that the engine plant that left Kenosha for Canada did so because the tax rate in Canada is 15 percent? Does Paul Ryan realize that the GE plant that just announced it is leaving Waukesha is doing so because Canada offered $2B and a 15 percent tax rate? Canadian workers are inferior to American workers. I can say so with authority because I closed a Canadian factory in 2015 while with Neptune and brought those jobs back to America   more profitably I might add. While with Tyden and SPX, I moved Mexican and Chinese factory jobs back to the U. S.   again more profitably. Id do so again in a heartbeat. The Speakers office last week said Ryan chose to give the speech at the NAM conference because one of his goals is to encourage companies to bring jobs back to the U. S. Thats odd. Then why would you refuse to do the one thing that would drive that more than any other, reduce the Corporate Tax rate to 15 percent like President Trump suggests? We want tax reform now. We think its really important, said Dorothy Coleman, vice president of tax and domestic economic policy at NAM. The Hill reported that she added that its becoming increasingly apparent that the U. S. tax code is holding businesses back. It is very encouraging: NAM is one of several prominent business groups that has not taken a stance on the border adjustments proposal. NAM should take this opportunity to reject the BAT and endorse President Trumps 15 percent Corporate tax. Ryan and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) have touted the BAT as removing the Made In America tax.  Thats just, as my grandfather would say, hogwash. Paul Nehlen is not another lifelong politician, but a business executive and inventor. Nehlen started out on the factory floor, and through Gods grace, grit, and determination rose to lead Fortune 500 manufacturing businesses around the world. Nehlen challenged Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsins 2016 First Congressional District to stop   Partnership and secure Americas border. Today he is waging the battle against the refugee resettlement racket and leading the cause to fight for Americas values. Nehlen has announced he is challenging Ryan in the 2018 Wisconsin First Congressional District primary. He lives in Delavan, Wisconsin."
"FBI: MS-13 Is Most Violent, Organized Gang in America",Breitbart,Bob Price,6/20/2017,"is not the largest street gang in the United States it is increasingly the most violent and  an official with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) told the House Homeland Security Committee Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence on Tuesday morning. The FBI assistant director said the gang had a propensity for gruesome violence. [William F. Sweeney, Jr. the assistant director in charge of the FBI in New York told the committee that street gangs in general show no signs of decreasing memberships or a decline in criminal activity.  In fact, according to the FBIs 2015 National Gang Report, memberships in gangs increased in 2013 to 2015 in 49 percent of jurisdictions. Sweeney told the members of Congress that the FBI estimates there could be up to 10, 000 members of the   gang living in the United States.  Although the leadership of the notorious   gang is based in El Salvador and Honduras, the clique leaders in the U. S. coordinate not only with each other in this country, they work with leaders in El Salvador, Sweeney said. They frequently discuss targets, members who have fallen out of favor, and ways to expand their operations.  This makes the   gang atypical in their approach to crime and organizational structure.  Members also capitalize on the ability to extort individuals living in the United States who still have family in Central America, threatening to harm family abroad. Using fear as a method of extortion, the gang often targets small business owners and restauranteurs, individuals who dont want to join the gang, and gang members who no longer want to be active, Sweeney said. The FBI assistant director told the committee that the gang has gained notoriety because of their brutal nature.  Their motivation is rooted in a desire to kill for the sake of killing. The attacks on their victims are gruesome, typically up close and personal. They often involve mutilation and dismemberment and are sometimes recorded.  On May 5, Breitbart Texas Managing Director and    Brandon Darby and Ildefonso Ortiz reported: Five Facts Every American Must Know About the Brutal   Gang.  For one,   members work as foot soldiers for Mexican cartels on U. S. soil. Two Minnesota teens were kidnapped and tortured by   gang members who were working on behalf of the Mexican Sinaloa Federation cartel. After a Sinaloa Cartel methamphetamine stash house had been robbed in St. Paul, Minnesota, the cartel hired   members from Los Angeles, California to fly to Minnesota to investigate. They tortured two local teens, nearly severing one finger off of one of the teens to try to get information. And although liberals blame deportations for the gangs creation,   originated from illegal immigrants in California.   members often pose a bigger threat to Border Patrol agents than the Mexican cartels the gangs work for. As reported by Breitbart Texas, the rise of   gang violence has dramatically impacted crime in the nations   city, Houston. In April, Governor Greg Abbott announced the creation of a Texas   Task Force to target these criminal alien gang members. Houston is one of the five cities that the FBI has identified to have a large   presence. Darby and Ortiz reported that the State of Texas considers the gang to be a Tier   threat     the most significant threat level. In March, two   gang members appeared in a Harris County courtroom laughing and waving at news cameras after being charged with the kidnapping and rape of one    girl, and the kidnapping, rape, and murder of another young girl in Jersey Village     a city within the Houston metropolitan area. The murdered girl was allegedly killed as part of a satanic ritual. On June 10, Breitbart Texas reported that the numbers of unaccompanied minors (UACs) being apprehended at our southern border with Mexico, particularly from El Salvador, was once again on the rise. Although there had been a   downtrend, 8, 005 UACs from El Salvador have been apprehended after crossing the border illegally since October 1, 2016. There were 1, 493 apprehended in May alone     nearly a fifty percent increase from the previous month.   members frequently recruit children who are illegal immigrants. The FBI assistant director from New York told members of the Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence that   members are typically much younger than those connected to other street gangs.  They take cues from the gang instead of relying on a productive family structure. Also, those emigrating from El Salvador to the United States are known to be exposed and desensitized to extreme violence at an early age.  Sweeney reported that the FBIs Long Island Gang Task Force (LIGTF) has arrested over 200   gang members since 2010. Over 35 of these gang members were involved in homicides. A majority of those   members have been convicted on federal racketeering charges for participating in murders, attempted murders, and assaults. Moreover,   is believed to be responsible for more than 20 homicides in Suffolk and Nassau Counties just since 2016 he told members of Congress on the committee.

"GOP Sen Lee: Im Frustrated by Lack of Transparency In GOP Healthcare Bill, Small Handful of Leadership Staffers Writing It - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/20/2017,"In a Facebook video Senator Mike Lee ( ) said that even though hes a part of the Senates healthcare working group, he hasnt seen the healthcare bill the Senate is working on, and it has become clear that the bill isnt being written by the group, but rather its being written by staffers of the Senates GOP leadership.  Lee said he hasnt seen the bill, even though Ive been a member of this working group among Senate Republicans assigned to help narrow the focus of some of this. I havent seen the bill. And it has become increasingly apparent in the last few days that, even though we thought we were going to be in charge of writing a bill within this working group, its not being written by us. Its apparently being written by a small handful of staffers for members of the Republican leadership in the Senate.  He added, So, if youre frustrated by the lack of transparency in this process, I share your frustration. I share it wholeheartedly. The American people need and deserve to be able to see legislation as it moves through the Senate.  (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
"Google Adds Jobs Section to Search Engine, Including Employer Ratings - Breitbart",Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/20/2017,"Google has revealed a new jobs section for their search engine, which will allow users to find job listings in their area, along with commute times and employer ratings. [At Google   this year, we announced Google for Jobs, a new   initiative focused on helping both job seekers and employers, through collaboration with the job matching industry, declared Google in an official blog post on Tuesday. One major part of this effort is launching an improved experience for job seekers on Google Search. Were happy to announce this new experience is now open for all developers and site owners.   For queries with clear intent like [head of catering jobs in nyc] or [entry level jobs in DC] well show a job listings preview, and each job can expand to display comprehensive details about the listing, they continued. If you already publish your job openings on another site like LinkedIn, Monster, DirectEmployers, CareerBuilder, Glassdoor, and Facebook, they are eligible to appear in the feature as well.  Employers will be able to list their available positions on the search engine, along with their company logo, job details, and reviews and ratings from current employees. Users looking for a job will be able to filter terms and positions in their determined location, allowing them to find more specific openings than other job listing sites. For added convenience going forward with any job hunt, it will also be possible to turn on alerts for a particular job search, with Google sending a notification via email when relevant new positions are advertised online, explained TechRadar. We should hopefully see this functionality introduced in the UK (and other territories) before too long, but for now, as mentioned, this is a   proposition.

Fred Fleitz: The North Korean Government Murdered Otto Warmbier as Obama Administration Did Almost Nothing,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,6/20/2017,"Fred Fleitz, senior vice president for Policy and Programs at the Center for Security Policy and former CIA analyst, joined Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesday to discuss the death of Otto Warmbier just days after returning from North Korea. He also talked about the possibility that Loretta Lynch will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee. [Fleitz said, This is just such a terrible story. The North Korean government murdered this young man. They murdered him. And we know that North Korea is a criminal regime. But what Im very angry about is how the Obama administration did almost nothing to get him back.   There were no consular visits, Fleitz continued, which are required under international law by the state representing us, Sweden, to check on him while he was in prison. There were none.  Fleitz continued to blast the Obama administration for dropping the ball. A young man who was his hotel roommate before he was arrested     hes a British citizen     says the Obama administration never contacted him to find out the particulars of why he was arrested. The Obama administration said to the Warmbier family, Stay silent. Do nothing, and the Obama administration pursued their idiotic policy of strategic patience, which we now know was an utter failure.

Fr. Paul Scalia: Our Spiritual Yearning Has Turned to Secular Politics and the Economy,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/20/2017,"Fr. Paul Scalia, son of late Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, joined SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Tuesdays Breitbart News Daily to talk about his new book, That Nothing May Be Lost: Reflections on Catholic Doctrine and Devotion. [Scalia said he assembled his book from two decades worth of essays at a providential moment when truth and Catholic doctrine [are] being neglected by American culture.  LISTEN: I think its timely precisely because people dont regard truth enough, he said. Theyre not devoted to it enough. In fact, they even see it as somehow a threat to them. The major theme in my book is that the truth of Christ and the truth the Catholic Church teaches is not confining or enslaving. It doesnt threaten us, but it actually brings us true freedom, true fulfillment, and peace.  Scalia said his book answers the question of: How does Gods life get to us?  Jesus Christ makes some fairly serious demands on us, in terms of morality. In fact, the Gospel for todays Mass is, You must be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. So this is more than just sort of being nice people. Were called to sanctity, he explained.  How does that happen? How do we live the demands of the Gospel, except by way of the grace of Christ? How does that come to us? It comes to us through the sacraments, beginning in baptism. It comes to us by way of these ceremonies that have a physical component, and, obviously, a spiritual component, he said.  They also have a communal component, Scalia continued. These are sacraments of the Church     they are things that are received together. These are the channels of grace. These are the means by which the life of Christ is imparted to us so that we can live His life and so that we can live according to His commands. It would have been cruel of Him to have given the commands that He did, and to call us to the kind of life that Hes called us, if He did not at the same time grant to us the grace to live what He requires.   That is why the sacraments are so important     because its how Christs life gets to us. This gets to the heart of what it means to be a Christian, which is not just to go and do nice deeds, on the hope that were being nice to people and were being kind and all that. To be a Christian really means to continue the life of Christ in the world. That cant be done apart from the sacraments, he said. Marlow asked Scalia if   would benefit from reading his book. There is a lot in there, and Ive thought this for a while. This is not just for a Catholic audience, Scalia replied. First of all, there is a lot in there thats common to all Christians, not exclusively Catholics. Second, I wrote all of these with a view to explaining the faith more and drawing people to the faith more. I think those who are curious about the Catholic faith     whether just out of an intellectual curiosity or with a view perhaps to becoming Catholic     I think this is just kind of a nice, gentle entry into it.   As I say in the introduction, Im not breaking any new ground theologically. Whats in the book is sort of the meat and potatoes of Catholic life. I think it gives a fair and rather simple and accessible presentation of the Catholic faith, he said. Marlow and Scalia discussed the importance of having a continuous conversation with God, rather than turning to prayer only at moments of great peril or gratitude. Scalia pointed to a line in the catechism of the Catholic Church, St. Pauls exhortation to prayer, which says: In order to pray always, or at all times, we need to pray at some times.  That continuous dialog with the Lord, its really brought into meaning by having occasional conversations with Him, Scalia elaborated. A friend of mine describes it as sort of power lines. In order for the power lines to go from one point to another, you have to have the poles at various intervals. It doesnt do much good to have a pole every two miles. The power line cant reach that. Its a good image of the prayer life. These intervals are what keep us in sync with the Lord and in that conversation.  This is the meat and potatoes of Catholic devotion, to take various moments throughout the day to just pause and turn ones attention to God, and maybe say a certain set prayer, or just ones own spontaneous prayer, but having those set times at which we do stop what were doing, set it aside, and turn our attention to God, he said. That way, when we return to what were doing, whatever ordinary activity with the family, at work, wherever, were more conscious of His presence there. Increasingly, were doing everything in union with Him at all times. Those periodic pauses to pray, those occasions help to buttress and to continue that constant conversation with the Lord, said Scalia. He described the spiritual state of the country as confused.  Man will always have a spiritual yearning, Scalia observed. God has created us to yearn for Him, and to seek Him. Were hardwired, if you will, that way. We will always be yearning spiritually. The reason that its confused now is, as I said before, we pushed truth and doctrine and organized religion to the side. We say those things sort of get in the way. But thats wrong.  Youve got charlatans throughout history who can mislead people, he noted. But this spiritual yearning every person has, it needs truth in order to be guided accurately. If its not, its really like an unguided missile. That spiritual yearning is launched, or rather it launches us. If it doesnt have something to guide that, then it becomes a very dangerous thing.  I think a lot of the spiritual yearning now is just turned elsewhere, Scalia proposed. For some reason, we think that Christianity is not tenable or our nation really did not have this view of the importance of religion, the importance of God, and so the spiritual yearning is turned, I think, a lot of times, into the secular. A lot of times people can make a god out of the secular world, out of politics, out of the economy or whatever else, and try to find salvation in those things. I think thats where we are most confused about this yearning that we all have.  Marlow and Scalia both referred to G. K. Chestertons famed observation: When men choose not to believe in God, they do not thereafter believe in nothing they then become capable of believing in anything.  The American founding is based on a concept that there is something true about the human person, Scalia pointed out. The Founders were not Catholic, and some of them were actually quite hostile to the Catholic Church, but this is the common patrimony of Christianity, and I would say the   tradition. There is something true about the human person, and from that truth arises, first of all, our obligations, but then also our rights.   What were seeing now is a confusion about the truth of the human person, and in many places, a denial that there is anything true about being human. What faith proposes is that, yes, there is something true about being human, and that unites all of us: our common human nature, what used to be called the brotherhood of man. When we have a concept that there is something true about the human person, then we can construct a society around that, he argued.  But if we deny that truth, then its every man for himself. Whoever has the most power wins. Thats why Pope Benedict, prior to becoming pope, wrote The Dictatorship of Relativism. Once truth is rejected, then its just a matter of power, and whoever has more power gets to set the rules. But when we have common truth to appeal to, then even the powerless have a voice because they can point to what is true, said Scalia. Marlow asked Scalia to tease something in That Nothing May Be Lost that readers will find surprising. He pointed to his writing on the paradox of the faith.  Paradox is a way to truth and greater devotion, Scalia explained. I point that out because I think a lot of people will run into seeming contradictions in the life of faith, and when they run into them, those can be difficult. People confuse difficulty for doubt, and so they stop there. Instead of grappling with these things and trying to understand them more and show reverence for the mystery of what God has revealed, people just kind of stop because they think theyre doubting. But really whats happened is, theyve run into difficulty.  Paradoxes really are the way for us to grow, when we grapple with them and try to understand them more, he said. That, I think, is the most surprising thing in the book because its the most surprising thing in faith.  Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

Frank Luntz: Trump Voters Blame Paul Ryan for Holding up Agenda as Speaker Finds Himself in Predecessor John Boehners Position,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,6/20/2017,"Focus group guru Frank Luntz, during an appearance on CBS This Morning on Monday, noted that he senses a rebellion against House Speaker Paul Ryan brewing among supporters of President Donald Trump nationwide. [It is the most significant condemnation of the Speaker since what I heard Trump voters saying about John Boehner about two years ago, Luntz said of his most recent focus groups thoughts on Ryan specifically and Republicans generally, except for Trump. They think Congress is holding up the agenda. They think Congress is part of the swamp. And they blame the Republicans as well as the Democrats.   Luntz even urged Ryan to tune into the broadcast of his full focus group. Luntzs focus group of Trump voters, which aired on CBS News and focused on Trump supporters across America, found that Trump backers are still generally impressed with the president despite whatever the media says. Luntz said of the Trump supporters fury with Washington   and support for him: Its not different at all [from what was seen during the 2016 presidential campaign]. Its just more passionate, and the divisions are just so much deeper. What surprised me the most about that segment was when we showed Trump pushing aside the European leaders at that meeting and they applauded him. They loved it, because to them it was the White House   it was the president asserting his rightful role as leader of the free world. The fact that Luntz would compare Ryans predicament inside the Republican Party to disgraced former Speaker John Boehner   who resigned amid a revolt from members in his own party back in 2015   is remarkable. Luntzs firm was once paid by Ryans campaign, and he praised the man who is now Speaker of the House while he was on the Ryan campaigns payroll, per a 2012 report in leftwing activist group Media Matters for America. When Boehner refused to enact the agenda of the American electorate, a group of more than 30 Republican members banded together and threatened to depose him from the Speakership. The members, led by now House Freedom Caucus chairman Rep. Mark Meadows ( ) used a little known tool called a motion to vacate the chair, by which they could have forced a vote. That would have set up a situation in the fall of 2015 in which Boehner would have needed to win reelection as Speaker in the middle of a Congress rather than at the regularly scheduled Speakership elections at the beginning of each Congress. Boehner did not have enough support in the Republican Party to win reelection. Since fellow defeated leadership official former House Majority Leader Eric Cantor   who was embarrassed by Republican voters in his own district in Virginia in 2014 when they elected  . Dave Brat ( )   was gone, the establishment GOP rallied around   Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to try to bump him into the Speakership after Boehners demise. But McCarthy could not get there owing to rumors about a potential sex scandal between him and   Rep. Renee Ellmers ( )   with Rep. Walter Jones ( ) putting a spotlight on that   so the establishment GOPs last hope was Ryan. Establishment Republicans made a desperate push   which ended up being successful   to   Ryan into the Speakership as their grip on power weakened and came down to one last person for the current Speaker. But in the     GOP presidential primaries, the establishment was unsuccessful, as Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush   among other GOP establishment donor class candidates   could not win the GOP nomination for president. Donald Trump, a vehemently   nationalist populist, stormed his way to the GOP nomination   and then past Democrat Hillary Rodham Clinton into the White House   with no help from Ryan. Ryan, as Breitbart News has demonstrated, purposefully abandoned Trump in October. I am not going to defend Donald Trump   not now, not in the future, Ryan said in a   GOP   conference call, audio of which was obtained by Breitbart News and published after the election. Ryans press team, in March 2017, argued those October comments from Ryan throwing Trump under the bus were specific to the Access Hollywood tape of Trump making vulgar remarks about women. But Ryans comments in the tape did not specify. As Speaker, Ryan has repeatedly undermined President Trumps agenda in the beginning six months of the Trump administration   the biggest example being Ryans repeated failures on healthcare.  The American Health Care Act only passed the House after Ryan took a trip to Hollywood and Europe. In his absence, Republicans across the conference negotiated a fix to pass the American Health Care Act, which Ryan himself had failed to secure. Ryans efforts on Tuesday to insert himself in the way of President Trumps tax reform agenda further threaten his future, and potentially jeopardize the presidents goal of reforming the tax code. Ryan also failed to secure funding for President Trumps promised border wall, and if the money is not in the upcoming government funding bill in September, the revolt Luntz speaks of against Ryan by Republicans     like the one Boehner faced in 2015   could be not that far behind."
Exclusive: Source Says Megyn Kelly Would Not Be Welcomed Back at Fox News,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/20/2017,"Controversy usually creates cash and big ratings   except if you are NBC News Megyn Kelly. [After Kellys controversial and   interview with Alex Jones tanked by again failing to beat out reruns of 60 Minutes and Americas Funniest Home Videos, New York radio host Mark Simone tweeted on Monday that NBC is trying to unload Kelly and convince Fox News to take her back.  But a   Fox News source told Breitbart News that there is no way Kelly could come back to the network. Quite simply, the source told Breitbart News, Kelly would not be welcomed back.  Inside scoop:  NBC now trying to get rid of Megyn Kelly. Even trying to get FOX to buy out her contract and take her back.     MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Simone also suggested that if Kelly becomes more toxic and her ratings tank even more, NBC will have to take her off the network, and if they are stuck with her, theyll give her an MSNBC show.  NBC will have to take her off the network     if they are stuck with her, theyll give her an MSNBC show,     MARK SIMONE (@MarkSimoneNY) June 19, 2017,  Before she bolted to NBC, Kelly anchored The Kelly File on Fox News. During the 2016 election cycle, Kelly won praise from mainstream media journalists when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the first Republican presidential debate in August of 2015 in Cleveland, Ohio. She also gave Never Trumpers a forum on her primetime show to constantly slam Trump throughout the election cycle. And as the Daily Beasts Lloyd Grove noted, Kelly also hastened [Roger] Ailes forced resignation last July with her fateful decision to recount his misconduct to a team of lawyers hired by 21st Century Fox to investigate allegations made in the sexual harassment and retaliation lawsuit filed by Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson.  New York magazines Gabriel Sherman reported that Kelly told investigators that Ailes made unwanted sexual advances toward her about ten years ago when she was a young correspondent at Fox.  As Grove pointed out, Kelly, in her book, said there was some poetic justice in the role she played in helping boot Ailes out of Fox News. I worked my tail off       I established myself as a serious person, Kelly wrote. I built my own power. And when the allegations against Roger hit, I used it. Perhaps there is some poetic justice in that.  NBC reportedly invested nearly $20 million a year to bring Kelly to the network, and NBCs investment has not paid any dividends at all. After her interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly was mocked for being way out of her league. And when HuffPost obtained the full unedited interview in which a nervous Kelly lobbed Putin softballs, Kelly was subjected to another round of criticism. Her interview with Jones did not have any news value and may have damaged NBCs and her reputation more than it helped. Advertisers like J. P. Morgan Chase fled while Kelly lost credibility in the eyes of many when, in a leaked recording that Jones released, Kelly is heard telling Jones, Its not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.  NBC did not help matters when it released a photo of Kelly and Jones that, as The Hills media columnist Joe Concha described, looked like they were on a Tinder date pulling up to a  .  Yet despite all of the hype, Kellys interview with Jones still flopped. 60 Minutes and Americas Funniest Home Videos reruns even beat Kellys show by nearly 40 percent in the coveted 18 to    demographic, as Concha noted. A television executive told CNN over the weekend that NBCs fundamental mistake was thinking that Kelly was actually a superstar.  NBC executives have already reportedly determined that viewers are not going to tune in to Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly just to watch Kelly and are freaking out over the ratings disaster that is Kelly."
CNN reporter lashes out at Sean Spicer for off-camera briefing: Hes just kind of useless,Business Insider,Mark Abadi,6/20/2017,"CNN correspondent Jim Acosta blasted the White House on Monday   for holding an   press conference that news outlets were   not permitted to record.     Speaking to CNNs Brooke Baldwin after the briefing, Acosta   lashed out at press secretary Sean Spicer, and questioned why he   and other reporters bothered attending in the first place.     The White House press secretary is getting to a point, Brooke,   where hes just kind of useless, Acosta said. If he cant come   out and answer the questions, and theyre just not going to do   this on camera or audio, why are we even having these briefings   or these gaggles in the first place?     Acosta pointed to multiple recent instances in which Spicer has   declined to answer questions about President Donald Trumps   position on climate change, leading Baldwin to wonder aloud if   Spicer is even having conversations with the president about the   subject.     Its a really good question, Brooke, and its a question that I   would ask, but unfortunately at this White House we wouldnt have   the video or audio to show you the answer to that question   because of the stonewalling were getting over here, Acosta   said.     Acosta then linked Mondays   press briefing to Trumps   reluctance to hold press conferences     hes held a handful of   brief joint press conferences with foreign leaders, but only one   on his own since becoming president in January.     I dont know why everybody is going along with this, Acosta   said. It just doesnt make any sense to me, and it just feels   like were sort of slowly but surely being dragged into what is a   new normal in this country where the president of the United   States of America is allowed to insulate himself from answering   hard questions.     The commentary echoed points Acosta made on Twitter during   Mondays briefing, in which he again accused the White House of   stonewalling and bemoaned what he saw as a suppression of   information.     tttThe Spicer    audio gaggle has begun. I cant show you a pic of Sean. So here is a look at some new socks I bought over the wknd    tttMake no mistake about what we are all witnessing. This is a WH that is stonewalling the news media. Hiding behind no   audio gagglestt  tttThere is a suppression of information going on at this WH that would not be tolerated at a city council mtg or press conf with a state gov. tt  tttCall me old fashioned but I think the White House of the United States of America should have the backbone to answer questions on camera. tt    Spicers   press gaggle coincided with reports that he   is  for his own replacement to take over the   briefings.

"EXCLUSIVE: Carnival Corporations Alleged Outsourcing Plan Sends Jobs to India, Europe",Breitbart,John Binder,6/20/2017,"Carnival Corporation, with the help of an outsourcing firm, is set to offshore hundreds of American jobs overseas to India and Eastern Europe, according to an alleged leaked  document obtained by Breitbart Texas. [The document depicts a map showing the American positions which the company will purportedly outsource to two foreign regions, leaving hundreds of American workers jobless.  Positions listed as moving from the U. S. to India, according to the alleged internal document, include a mix of high and   jobs involving: Meanwhile the jobs allegedly being offshored to Poland and Romania include: The only jobs listed to be allegedly remaining in the U. S. within the companys IT department involve account, operational, and compliance management and   support, among others. A source close to Breitbart Texas said earlier this year in February, Carnival Corporation began executing the outsourcing plan led by Capgemini, telling Americans to either take jobs with the outsourcing firm and risk being fired six months later or leave the company altogether. Carnival Corporation teamed up with Capgemini, a French outsourcing firm, to allegedly mass   the American IT workers remaining at the company who had yet to be replaced by cheaper, foreign workers. In a statement to Breitbart Texas regarding the allegations of offshoring, Carnival Corporation Spokesman Roger Frizzell said: This is a relatively small group of employees within the company     roughly 130 people within our IT organization     that moved over several months ago to Capgemini, which has offices in Miami and throughout the U. S. A vast majority of these individuals     100 or so     will continue in their existing IT roles to support Carnival Corporation at their existing Carnival office locations (and existing salaries). Discussions are underway with the remaining 30 employees, who are being considered for other positions in the U. S. within Capgemini. It also important to note that every Carnival employee within this IT group was offered employment several months ago with Capgemini as they evaluated the needs of our business. As I mentioned, more than 100 of these individuals are continuing in their existing roles in support of Carnival Corporation in the same Carnival Corporation office location.        Based on the latest update from Capgemini, it looks as if they are optimistic that new positions and opportunities will be found for the other 30 employees. A source familiar with Carnivals alleged outsourcing plan said they doubted the companys claim that only 130 employees were impacted by the changes, saying at the original group of employees impacted was likely closer to about 250. We were forced to take the Capgemini jobs, the source told Breitbart Texas. They forced me into Capgemini and because I didnt take it, they said I resigned, but I didnt. I wasnt given a choice.  The source also said that although many employees did take jobs at Capgemini originally, some eventually left their new positions because they understood that their job would eventually be   overseas. Capgemini, like other outsourcing firms such as Infosys and Tata Consulting, is known for contracting with major U. S. corporations to replace Americans through the   visa. After they are replaced with   foreign workers, the jobs are eventually offshored altogether. As reported by Breitbart Texas, domestic companies have been able to get away with importing   foreign workers by hiding   visa applications behind the outsourcing firms they partner with. In Carnival Corporations case, the company has the potential to deny any such offshoring and   of Americans, as Capgemini is technically handling the operation.

Border Patrol Agents Arrest Two Illegal Workers after Ben &amp Jerrys Protest,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/20/2017,"Border Patrol agents in Vermont arrested two illegal immigrants who worked as dairy farmers following their participation in a Ben  Jerrys protest march. Agents stopped the suspects as they returned from the demonstration to go back to work. [The agents arrested Yesenia   and Esau   on Saturday after a stop at a routine immigration check. The location of the stop is near the U. S.  Border. Agents transported the two migrants to a detention facility after determining they had no legal status in the U. S. the Washington Post reported.  The two illegal workers joined with others protesting conditions at a Ben  Jerrys factory in Waterbury, Vermont, Breitbart News reported. The workers marched to demand better pay and living conditions on the farms that provide milk to the nationwide ice cream maker. We cant wait anymore. We are going to pressure them and see what happens, Mexican migrant worker Victor Diaz told reporters. Diaz is a Mexican immigrant who works on a dairy farm in Vergennes. Following the arrest of the two illegal farm workers, others gathered outside a U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) office in St. Albans. We were there to denounce the arrest of Esau and Yesenia and to call on ICE to use their discretion to release them back to their families, back to their community so they can continue to live and work in Vermont and continue to raise their voice for their dignity and human rights, Migrant Justice organizer Will Lambek told the Post. The Washington news outlet reported that Vermont has about 1, 000 farm workers who are Latino. They reported that many of those are in the country illegally. The Migrant Justice group claims their workers are being targeted for selective enforcement by immigration officials. They brought up Enrique Balcazar and Zully Palacios, who protested on Monday. The two migrant workers were arrested in March and were released later that month. Ben  Jerrys responded to the protests with the following statement: We are concerned that   productive members of our community, who contribute to the success of dairy farms in Vermont, would face criminalization. We need policy change that serves Vermonts dairy workers, farmers, and industry as a whole. The company said it is working to resolve its differences with the workers. They did not make any statement about the illegal immigration status of their workers. Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

"German Police Hold Day of Action Against Hate Postings Online, 36 Targeted",Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/20/2017,"BERLIN (AP)     German authorities are taking action against 36 people suspected of posting hate speech online, most of them accused of   incitement. [The Federal Criminal Police Office said police across the country searched homes of suspects, questioned them and took unspecified further measures early Tuesday. There was no word of any arrests.  The   day of action against hate postings followed a similar exercise last year. The police office said most of the postings targeted Tuesday had a   motivation, but authorities also targeted a suspected   extremist, two   suspects and one case where the victims sexual orientation was attacked. In April, the Cabinet approved a bill to punish social networking sites if they fail to swiftly remove illegal content such as hate speech. Parliament has yet to approve it."
Republican wins Georgia House special election,CNN,Eric Bradner,6/20/2017,"Atlanta (CNN) Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a   special election for a Georgia House seat on Tuesday, denying Democrats their first major victory of the Donald Trump era.  Handel bested Ossoff by 3. 8 percentage points in the most expensive House race in history.  It was a much closer margin than the   point wins typically posted by former Rep. Tom Price    whose departure to become Trumps health and human services secretary created the vacancy.  But it wasnt what Democrats who pumped $23 million into Ossoffs campaign so desperately craved: A win.  Handels victory showed that even with Republicans in power, the GOPs message in recent election cycles    focused largely on urging voters to reject House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi    remains potent.  The successful execution of that playbook could calm congressional Republicans ruffled nerves as the GOP advances major legislation to overhaul the nations health care system and eyes a massive reform of its tax structure.  It also calls into question whether Democrats can sustain the energy fueling the partys   resistance after losses in four consecutive special elections    including Kansas, Montana and South Carolina.  At a Hyatt Regency in northern Atlanta, more than 100 attendees cheered and celebrated Handels victory.  A little after 10:30 p. m. ET, Handel took the stage and told supporters shed received a call from Ossoff conceding the race.  He was more than gracious and he thanked me for a spirited campaign. And I wish him and Alisha all the best in the new life that they are going to be starting, she said, referring to Ossoffs fiancee, Alisha Kramer.  Handel thanked Trump, who had tweeted his support for her campaign in recent days, by name    prompting the crowd to interrupt with cheers and chants of Trump, Trump, Trump.  A special thanks to the President of the United States of America, she said. And lets not forget, our equally great vice president, Mike Pence.  Handel also thanked House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who remains in the hospital recovering from the recent shooting at a GOP congressional baseball practice.  Right up until that tragic day on the ballfield, Steve would drop me a text message every single week to make sure I was doing OK and hanging tough, Handel said. He even called me the terminator in one of them. Handel issued a call for civility, saying that we also need to lift up this nation so that we can find a more civil way to deal with our disagreements. Because in these United States of America, no one    no one    should ever feel their life threatened over their political beliefs.  Ossoff and Handel faced off Tuesday in what has become the most expensive House race in history, with the candidates, their parties and super PACs pouring more than $50 million combined into the effort to win a single House seat in the northern Atlanta suburbs.  More than 140, 000 voters cast their ballots early    an astounding number for a special election, and one that nearly matches presidential contests.  The race was viewed nationally as a gauge of whether Trumps sagging approval ratings are a drag on Republicans that could threaten the partys control of the House in the 2018 midterm elections.  Democrats, meanwhile, saw in Georgia an early test of their strategy of trying to win typically Republican seats in suburban areas    districts that are relatively highly educated, wealthy and diverse.  Trump weighed in on Twitter late Monday and early Tuesday, attacking Ossoff for living just outside the district, claiming Ossoff will raise taxes and calling Handel a hard worker who will never give up! With the inflated price tag and the   lag time between the special election and the November 2018 midterms, the contest might not hold much predictive value.  But it did carry the potential to provide the winning party a huge psychic boost.  With Handels win, Republicans on Capitol Hill are likely to feel they are on the right track    helping the GOPs push for health care and tax reform legislation. It could also show House incumbents that they can separate themselves from Trump effectively on the campaign trail, and stave off a potential wave of retirements.  Ossoff and Handel were the top two finishers in an April 19 primary, advancing to the    runoff election.  The district has historically leaned heavily Republican. Price won each time he was on the ballot since 2004 with more than 60% of the vote. Mitt Romney carried the district by more than 23 points when he faced former President Barack Obama in 2012.   However, it was Trumps collapse    besting Hillary Clinton by just 1. 5 points in the district in 2016    that led Democrats to believe it could be in play.  It was the best shot the party had of the four House special elections this spring to win a seat that now belongs to Republicans. But in November 2018, Democrats are expected to have many better   opportunities. According to the Cook Political Reports Partisan Voter Index, there are 71   districts that have less   electorates than Georgias 6th District.  Georgia was not the only special election that happened Tuesday. CNN projected just after 9 p. m. ET, Republican Ralph Norman will win the special election in the South Carolina 5th Congressional District, defeating Democrat Archie Parnell in a closer than expected race to fill Mick Mulvaneys seat. This story has been updated to reflect the latest results."
German Defence Commissioner Vows: In The End There Will Be A European Army,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,6/20/2017,"As negotiations between Britain and the EU over Brexit get underway, a senior German politician has declared that a European Army is inevitable.[  Bartels, the parliamentary commissioner for the Armed Forces, insisted: In the end, there will be a European Army.   Bartel alleged the   system of national armies accountable to national governments was disorganised, technically fragmented and duplicate structures unnecessarily. He claimed Europes peoples do not want to go down the solitary national path anymore. Not in Germany, not in the Netherlands, not in the Czech Republic and not in Italy.  He added: Every step in the right direction [towards an EU army] is important.

Towards the end of 2016,   Thompson warned that Government officials were signing Britain up to military integration schemes so ambitious that he considered it tantamount to the UK joining the single currency in its last two years of EU membership. The plans use all means at the EUs disposal to encroach on every single area of UK defence planning, he said. Policy, procurement, funding, intelligence services, command structure and defence research are all appropriated by these EU plans.

"Americans Laid Off by H-1B, Outsourcing to Rally at White House",Breitbart,John Binder,6/20/2017,"Americans who saw their jobs taken by foreign guest workers on the   visa and outsourcing schemes will rally outside the White House before President Trumps meeting with Indias Prime Minister. [Attorney Sara Blackwell, who represents Americans laid off due to the   visa and outsourcing, has organized the Youre Fired rally, named after the recent 60 Minutes special that exposed how American companies hire cheaper foreign workers.  You got our vote, now we want a voice, the flyer for the rally reads, as it addresses Trump. Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa and allowed to stay for up to six years. That number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced and forced to train their foreign replacements. Outsourcing and offshoring of American has similarly been a detriment to U. S. workers. Blackwell previously told Breitbart Texas that The offshoring is worse than the visa program.  I sat in on a Goldman Sachs conversation where they said they would offshore if   was reformed, Blackwell said at the time. The business model is to use   and then offshore those jobs in the  .  The   worker rally will come days after Trump met with tech CEOs, often accused of mass  . At the recent meeting, the White House signaled that Trump would be willing to work with the tech industry on such immigration issues, despite blasting their demands for unregulated immigration and more   visas on the campaign trail. The policies pushed by the tech industry are often criticized by immigration hawks for depressing the wages of American workers. As Breitbart Texas reported, the tech industry has increased their lobbying for more   foreign workers since Trump took office, claiming that they have a shortage of Americans with the skills they need. The rally is also purposefully being held days before Trump is set to meet with Indias Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Because Indian nationals are the biggest beneficiaries of the   visa, lawmakers in the foreign country have been lobbying Modi to demand Trump drop his ongoing   legal review of the   system and its impact on Americans. India has profited so much from the U. S.s immigration policies, including the   visa, that a new study revealed that the foreign nation has enjoyed an economic tech boom as American jobs are taken by Indian nationals and outsourcing fully to India, as Breitbart Texas reported. The Youre Fired rally will take place in front of the White House on June 26 at 11 a. m. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder."
Boeing to Begin Testing Self-Flying Airplanes - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/20/2017,"Airplane manufacturer Boeing is set to start testing   vehicles according to new reports. [The Independent reports that Boeing will soon be testing   planes, possibly utilizing artificial intelligence to make decisions usually left up to human pilots. Boeings aim is to develop an aircraft that can operate entirely with minimal human interaction. Planes can already take off, cruise, and land without much interaction from human pilots, so the idea of a fully functioning artificial   plane is not too far fetched.  Mike Sinnett, Boeings vice president of product development, told Reuters, When I look at the future I see a need for you know 41, 000 commercial jet airplanes over the course of the next 20 years. And that means were going to need something like six hundred and seventeen thousand more pilots. Thats a lot of pilots.  He continued to say, so one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none.  So one of the ways that may be solved is by having some type of autonomous behaviour and that could be anything from taking instead of five pilots on a long haul flight down to three or two, taking two pilots down to one in a freight situation, or in some cases going from one to none, he explained. Starting this summer, Boeing will use advanced cockpit simulators used in the training of pilots to test the new   technology before implementing it in an actual aircraft. Boeing isnt the only airplane manufacturer looking at automated travel: Airbus is currently working on   flying cars and will be testing   flying taxis by the end of 2017 with the aim of rolling out further access to the taxis in 2021. Airbus, however, is looking to develop an     system while Boeing seems to be focusing on long haul, large passenger flights.

Singapore PM apologizes for family feud,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,6/20/2017,"(CNN) Singapores Prime Minister has made a rare public apology for a family spat that has gripped a city  unused to elites airing their grievances.   Lee Hsien Loong refuted allegations that he has violated the will of his late father,  Singapores former leader Lee Kuan Yew, for his own political gain.  I deeply regret that this dispute has affected Singapores reputation and Singaporeans confidence in the government. As your Prime Minister, I apologize to you for this, Lee said in a video statement posted to Facebook that also aired on national TV. The high esteem in which most Singaporeans hold their former leader and the  s strict censorship laws have made the public spat something of a political soap opera for the Singapores 5. 5 million people. The extent of any political fallout is still unclear. The Lee family is fighting over the future of their late fathers home in central Singapore. The Prime Minister wants to preserve the house, while his brother and sister want to demolish it. As the eldest of the siblings, it grieves me to think of the anguish it would have caused our parents if they were alive, he said.  Lee went on to say hes done all he can to avoid the current situation.  He said he would also refute the allegations in Parliament on July 3, adding that he has instructed the ruling Peoples Action Party whip to be lifted    allowing members of parliament to ask questions and not be bound by the party position.  I hope that this full public airing in Parliament will dispel any doubts that have been planted and strengthen confidence in our institutions and our system of government, Lee said.  The house at the center of the squabble, The family patriarch, Lee Kuan Yew, is credited with turning Singapore from a colonial trading post into a thriving  . He served as the countrys leader from 1959 to 1990 and died in 2015. In his will, Lee had asked for his home    a   bungalow the countrys founding father lived in since the 1940s    to be demolished immediately after his death, or if his daughter, Lee Wei Ling, preferred to live in it, after she moved out. All three of the elder Lees children publicly issued a statement in 2015, saying they hoped the state would honor their fathers wishes. Lee Hsien Loong also said he would recuse himself from all government decisions involving the home.  However, in a statement released last week, Lees sister and brother    Lee Wei Ling and Lee Hsien Yang    claimed the Prime Minister and his wife are behind what is represented as government initiatives to preserve the house. They further alleged Lee threatened them and demanded their silence over their fathers wishes hoping to inherit the faith Singaporeans had in Lee Kuan Yew through the visible symbol of the house.  The Prime Minister forcefully denied that charge in his statement. These allegations go beyond private and personal matters and extend to the conduct of my office and the integrity of the government. As much as I would like to move on and end an unhappy experience for Singaporeans, these baseless accusations against the government cannot be left unanswered. They must be and will be dealt with openly and refuted, he said.  Lee said his father left the house to him. My siblings were not happy about this. I tried to deal with the unhappiness privately, Lee said, including offering to sell the house to his sister for $1. Lee said that offer failed, so then he sold the house to his brother at a fair market value and donated the proceeds to charity. There should be no reason for any quarrel, since I no longer own the house and I do not take part in any government decisions on the house. However, my siblings have decided to go out and make serious allegations, publicly, Lee said.  On Tuesday, Lee Hsien Yang responded to the Prime Ministers public message with yet another post on Facebook, suggesting the issue is not going away any time soon.  We object to LHLs   about Lee Kuan Yews demolition wish, he said. We asked a simple question, that he has refused to answer for a week: Was our father, Lee Kuan Yew, unwavering in his demolition wish? Yes or no? While the elder Lee was lauded for his economic accomplishments, he also was responsible for stringent laws and regulations that dictated most, if not all, aspects of society    including media and political freedoms, censorship and even the selling of chewing gum.

12-year-old girl comes out to her Mormon congregation,CNN,Paul P. Murphy,6/20/2017,"(CNN) Savannah, 12, made a decision this January she was going to come out as lesbian at her Mormon Church. Nothing was going to stop her. Shes a normal   girl in Utah: She loves to draw and make art. When she grows up, she wants to be a Disney animator. Her favorite bands are Imagine Dragons and Fall Out Boy. On June 22, 2016, one day after her birthday, Savannah came out to her parents as lesbian. Mom had suspicions and knew that day might come.                                                 I looked at her and said, OK, I love you.  And Ill support you no matter what you do, said Heather, her mother. The family felt strongly that they didnt have the right to prevent Savannah from telling her story publicly, including sharing it with CNN, but asked that their hometown and last names be withheld to give them a measure of privacy. After coming out to her parents, Savannah began the process of coming out to her friends and extended family. Six months later, she felt a calling. I had a feeling like I should come out to the church, Savannah said shyly.  I came out to all of my family and I just wanted to do something more. Both her parents were taken aback by their daughters desire to come out in front of her church.  I was mostly nervous for her and where this would take her as a    girl, said Josh, her father.  Josh and Savannah are still members of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints, the official name of the church. Heather left the church a year and a half ago after official church policy documents were leaked online in 2015. Those documents, confirmed by the church to CNN to be authentic, apostatize   couples who marry and bar any of their children from blessings or baptism until they themselves reach legal age. They remain church policy.  Official church policy welcomes members of the Mormon faith that have   attractions. They say its possible to be Mormon and gay. Church teaching, however, mandates that members with   attractions cannot act on those feelings. They must remain celibate and they cannot get married to members of the same sex. It resonated in my heart that it felt wrong, said Heather, speaking about those policies.  Her inklings about Savannahs sexuality kept running through her mind.    The family gathered, walking Savannah through the good and the bad that could come from her speech.  They walked through what the Mormon Church teaches about   attraction. We let her make that decision, not us, Josh said pointedly.  I had nothing to do with . .. coercing her or anything.  Heather remembers Savannahs rationale.  I want to be a voice for those that might be positive, she recalls Savannah saying.  I want them to know that Im an ally.  That theyre safe with me.  I want them to know that its OK to be Mormon and be gay.  She also wanted to garner more respect for gays in her church, something she feels is lacking. We came to the conclusion it wasnt our place we couldnt silence her, said Heather.  It would be giving her a bigger message that she wasnt allowed to speak or there was something wrong with her.  So, Savannah went to work writing.  Draft after draft, she began crafting her message. She decided on giving testimony on Fast Sunday, which is traditionally when Mormons hold testimony meetings. Its sort of what you believe in, Savannah says of testimony.  Its your spiritual talk.  An emailed statement to CNN from the local bishop, Judd Law, said, It is common for members of The Church of Jesus Christ of   Saints to stand before a congregation of families and share feelings and beliefs    a testimony    during a worship service. The day had arrived.  Savannah put on a tie and battled her anxiety, making her way to the rostrum.  Friends of hers began quietly recording videos as a keepsake, which they later gave to the family.  The family then provided that unedited, raw video to CNN.  Edited versions of the video have since been published on social media Savannah first told her story on an LGBT Mormon podcast, I Like to Look for Rainbows. She began speaking.  Hi, my name is Savannah and I want to share my testimony with you. Her voice didnt betray her nerves.  Savannah read slowly, focused on getting her testimony out.  She was scared to see peoples faces and their reaction to her testimony so she did not look up once to see their reactions. Then Savannah said it she came out as gay in front of her congregation. God loves me just this way, because he loves all his creations, she said in the speech.  I do believe he made me this way on purpose. She didnt stop with theology. Savannah wanted her congregation to know about her hopes and dreams, too. For Savannah, even at 12, its simple.  She wants to love herself and not feel shame for being who she is.  I hope to find a partner and have a great job.  I hope to get married and have a family, she said.  I know these dreams and wishes are good and right.  I know I can have all of these things as a lesbian and be happy.  Shortly after that, the mic suddenly cut out.  Its unclear what exactly happened, but one of the church leaders leaned over and began speaking to Savannah. I thought it was broken at first.  So, I turned around to talk to him, she said.  And then he told me to sit down.  Despite repeated requests to church headquarters and Law, the bishop, they did not explain why Savannahs mic ceased to work.  On a Mormon Church website titled Mormon and Gay, it offers the following advice on Mormons who want to come out: If you decide to share your experiences of feeling   attraction or to openly identify as gay, you should be supported and treated with kindness and respect, both at home and in church. In the video, Savannah returns to her seat as murmured chatter continues around her. I was telling her that she was perfect and beautiful, says Heather. A church leader stood up and made a small speech as Savannah was sitting down, in part saying, I also want to recognize that we are all children of God.  And that we are loved by our heavenly Father.  And I have no doubt that heavenly Father has made us all unique in different ways.  For that, I am grateful. In the emailed statement to CNN, Law took issue with the recorded video, saying it was unauthorized. Additionally, he said that a group of visitors jubilantly left the service. . ..  Everyone is welcome and understands the standards of decorum and behavior if they decide to participate.  It is unfortunate that this group of adults chose to violate them.  Law said the video was being exploited for political purposes.  But Savannahs parents dont see it that way. They say they didnt witness anyone being disruptive.  They also say there was no group present. Savannah invited a few close friends as allies, Heather tells CNN, responding to the statement from the local bishop.  There was no group.  The family did leave shortly after. Heather says Savannah was distraught and crying. Savannah says she was feeling a mixture of emotions. She was confused because she didnt know what was going on, she was happy because she finally came out at church and felt accepted. But she was sad because she couldnt finish her speech. Her parents, though, are proud.  Josh responds, absolutely, when asked.  She has more courage than Ive ever seen in anybody, Heather says.  To be able to share something so personal with everybody.  That made my heart soar as a parent.  This incident has created some tender emotions, first and foremost for a brave young girl, said Law in his emailed statement to CNN.  As a congregation, we continue to reach out, and do all that we can to make sure she knows that we love her and her family."
"More women are signing up to run, but will they succeed?",CNN,Kelly Wallace,6/20/2017,"(CNN) Republican Karen Handels victory in the Georgia special congressional election makes history for women: She is the first female Republican in the state to ever be elected to Congress. Her victory follows some groundbreaking moves for women in politics overseas. Britain recently elected a record number of women to Parliament    more than ever before    to make up a bit more than 30% of the legislative body. After that news, I took to Twitter and asked  What will it take for this to happen in the US? Sadly, we havent seen dramatic change over the past 20 years when it comes to women in elected posts. If you follow the issue, you know the numbers by now: Women, while composing more than 50% of the population, make up just 19. 4% of the House of Representatives and just 21% of the Senate, according to a recent report by the Center for American Progress. Beyond Washington, the news isnt much better: Women hold fewer than 25% of state legislative positions, 10% of governorships and 19% of mayoral posts in all cities with more than 30, 000 residents, the Center for American Progress reports. There are reasons to be somewhat optimistic that those numbers, especially on the local level, could start to change, as thousands of women have stepped up saying they plan to run following the election of President Donald Trump. Emilys List, which backs Democratic female candidates who support abortion rights, says that since Election Day, it has heard from almost 15, 000 women looking to run for office, according to a spokeswoman. Emerge America, which also recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office, says it has trained more than 1, 000 women since November. The Center for American Women and Politics, which is nonpartisan, had 270 women attend its Ready to Run workshop for potential candidates this year, compared with about 175 women who typically attend, said Jean Sinzdak, the groups associate director. Of the 270 women, 140 said they were Democrats, 70 said they were Republicans, a handful said they were with a third party. The remainder did not declare a party connection, she said. And IGNITE, which is also nonpartisan and focuses on younger women, starting as young as high school and urging them to run in their school elections, has seen tremendous interest, which isnt easing up, according to Anne Moses, the groups founder and president. Since February, Moses says, it has had inquiries from 500 women across the country who want to start college chapters and a similar number of educators who want to bring IGNITE programming into their schools. The group has had to find new venues for its young womens political conferences, which are held across the country, because they are selling out and more women want to attend, she said. Every single one of those is closed to capacity a month before, Moses said. Its across the board everywhere. Everywhere we go, were selling out of everything (and) getting shut down for space. The interest and activism was sparked in a big way by what many women say was the sexism and misogyny they witnessed during the presidential campaign. There is no question there is more energy and momentum on the part of women considering tossing their hat into the ring, but will that translate into more women actually running for office and more of them winning? Political qualifications are no longer a thing Moses says its up to her and other womens organizations and networks to get all these women to run but concedes that shes not sure how many will actually do it. She tells the story of a conversation she recently had with a woman who seems like a perfect candidate: Shes a   executive doing significant work for her community, a married mother motivated by the issues and someone really interested in running. And yet, when Moses started to talk to her about 2018, she could see her hesitation. Oh, Im not ready, she told Moses. You can see, wow, its still going to be really hard to get these women to do it. Historically, there has been what scholars call an ambition gap when it comes to men and women and their desires for political office. If you polled college students, you tended to hear less ambition on the part of women versus men to run for elected office, said Judith Warner, senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and author of the organizations new report, Opening the Gates: Clearing the Way for More Women to Hold Political Office. But that isnt likely to hold up with younger women, especially after they watched Hillary Clinton come very close to becoming the first female president of the United States, she said. I think (the fact) that a generation of girls and young women have seen a female presidential candidate means that its going to become normal for them, said Warner, who is a also a contributing writer to the New York Times magazine and author of Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety. Its not going to be this kind of freak occurrence, and thats a great thing. When something is normalized, then younger people can aspire to it. How much sexism played a role in Clintons defeat remains an open question, but the research shows that for congressional elections, it isnt an obstacle to women running and winning and, therefore, should not necessarily be holding women back, Warner said. The research now looking at voter opinion and also looking at media coverage for women who are running for Congress really shows that they do not suffer from a disproportionate amount of bias, she said. Even if things are still said and comments are still made and they absolutely are, when push comes to shove, it doesnt play out at the ballot box. Marianne Schnall is author of the highly regarded What Will It Take to Make a Woman President? Conversations About Women, Leadership  Power, which includes interviews with newsmakers including Gloria Steinem, Sheryl Sandberg and Nancy Pelosi. (Last year, Beyonce said it was the one book she thought all her fans should read.) When I did interviews for the book, what was talked about a lot in holding women back is that women often question whether they are qualified enough or expert enough, do they know enough about foreign policy or all the issues to run for office, and it holds them back, said Schnall, who has started a nonpartisan digital platform, What Will It Take, that aims to inform, connect and engage with women on all areas of leadership. She says that regardless of ones politics, it is fair to say that Trump was a candidate who never had a career in government and has little experience on the range of domestic and foreign policy issues he faces. His success can send a message to women that if you just want to do this, youre more than ready and able, Schnall said. Moses, of IGNITE, agrees. Women tend to hold themselves to a higher standard in terms of qualifications but may think about things differently after Trumps victory. Whether or not you like him, people chose him because they wanted someone who was coming from outside the political sphere, she said. Clearly, political qualifications are no longer a thing, and so I think thats been liberating. . .. I think women are going to stop holding themselves to such a high standard. The power of incumbency  If more women conquer those internal barriers and decide to run for office, what are the chances theyll be successful? Warner, in her recent report, found that one of the biggest obstacles women continue to face is a gatekeeper system that helps insiders and limits ballot access. These institutional gatekeepers are basically people in the political party apparatus, incumbents and businesspeople, she said. They are the people who decide, Who are we going to back to run for office? she said. They are the kingmakers, Warner said. They designate who is going to be a good candidate, who is a viable candidate, who are they going to put money into, and then those people then . .. run for office and win, and those people are very rarely women. Moses says the system favors incumbents, and incumbents are usually men. Its always easier to win an open seat than it is to take out an incumbent . .. and so there is an inherent disadvantage in the system in that regard. She said that based on the power of incumbency, the lack of term limits in the House of Representatives and the Senate and the gerrymandering of congressional seats to favor one political party or the other, it will take a long, long, time to see women in greater numbers at the national level. One way to speed change is to follow the leads of Britain and other European countries, which set gender targets for each political party, she said. In Europe, when the European countries jump up (in female elected officials) its because of quotas, Moses said. Americans dont like to talk about quotas. They think theres got to be a different way to talk about it, but lets call a spade a spade. Thats whats going to get us there. When Schnalls book was published in 2013, the United States ranked 79th in the world when it came to women in national legislatures, she wrote on CNN. com for International Womens Day. The situation has actually worsened in 2017, with the US falling to 104th in the world, which she calls shocking. She hopes her platform will connect women to all the groups that exist to help any woman who is considering running for elected office. Women may not realize there are so many tools and resources out there to support them, she said. This is part of why I launched the What Will It Take movement platform is because I wanted to offer a   central hub of all these wonderful groups and programs and trainings that are just out there, ready to train women and give them the network and support that they need to be successful, Schnall said. Going local, starting young  As a mother of two teenage girls, one of whom is active in politics at college, Schnall believes that a key way to get more women to run and win is to start early on, when they are girls, reversing some of the messages theyre receiving about their place in the world. This starts very early on in girlhood, where actually sometimes being seen as powerful, as a leader, is discouraged, or this pressure on women and girls to fit in and please and be liked and not take up too much space, she said. One of the things we really need to do is just that first step of encouraging women and girls to see themselves as leaders in the first place. Moses believes that getting to girls early is really the most promising intervention point. Getting to them as they are thinking about their careers is much easier than persuading a    woman with two kids and a career to give up her job and run for office or, if its a     legislative position, try to take on that post along with doing her job and taking care of her family. With young women, what were having great success with is, we can actually get them into the next step very, very easily, which is, OK, youre going to graduate college or grad school. You need to get a staffer job, because guess what? When your legislator moves on, youre more apt to be tapped.   One young woman in Boston, a freshman at Harvard who recently hooked up with IGNITE, will be running for Cambridge City Council in November, she said. Another young woman in Oakland who started with IGNITE when she was in college is now running for Oakland City Council. Women should know that they do not need to wait, she said. There are 520, 000 elected offices in the United States, 99. 9% of them at the local level, she said.  You do not need to be a    attorney with a big long career to run for them, Moses said. Most local offices are     you have to have another job. Its in some ways   for young women. Local office may not seem as sexy, she said, but it is a key way to get more women in state and federal elected positions. Youve got to get people in the pipeline so they can move up the pipeline. People move from local office to state office. They move from state office to federal office. Thats how guys did it, and thats how the change is going to happen. Through her platform, Schnall also hopes to showcase more women sharing positive stories of making a difference in elected office. Even at a time of unprecedented activism, politics can look like a really dysfunctional place, she said. What also will help get more women in office is making the case for why we need women, she said. In my interviews, many people spoke to this fact that women . .. tend to be consensus builders and have very different ways of communicating that could be helpful especially in the partisan atmosphere that were in now. I actually have never been more positive, she said. There are women and girls who never really had thought too much or connected too much with the fact that there was this lack of parity or that there was sexism in the culture . .. but theres new energy out there."
Georgia special election: Highlights,CNN,Daniella Diaz,6/20/2017,(CNN) Republican Karen Handel has beat Democrat Jon Ossoff in Georgias 5th District special election. On mobile? Full live blog here. Read more on the Georgia 6th District race: Who is Karen Handel? Who is Jon Ossoff? 5 things to watch in Georgias   House special election
5 things to watch in Georgia special election,CNN,Eric Bradner,6/20/2017,"(CNN) Democrats have been desperate to deal President Donald Trump a real setback at the ballot box for months    and all their hopes are riding on Tuesdays House election in Georgia.  In whats become the most expensive House race in history, both Democrats and Republicans have tons at stake.  A win by Democrat Jon Ossoff will give his party a crucial proof point that Trumps unpopularity is damaging Republicans up and down the ballot    and make it much harder GOP lawmakers on Capitol Hill to tie their own political fortunes to Trump on health care, tax reform and more. It would also give progressives who pumped $23 million into Ossoffs campaign something to celebrate.  A win by Republican Karen Handel, meanwhile, would give Trump and Republicans confidence in their agenda. And it would deliver a sharp blow to Democrats who had seen the race as their last, best shot at a special election win that would pump their base up and help them draw   candidates for the 2018 midterms. Ossoff and Handel were the top two finishers in an April 19 primary, and advanced to the June 20    runoff. The polls in Cobb, Fulton and DeKalb counties    the three where the sixth district House seat is located    close at 7 p. m. ET on Tuesday.  Here are five things to watch in Georgias special election:  Will Republicans show up? Would they vote for Ossoff? In ordinary years, this is no swing district. Former Rep. Tom Price    whose departure to become Trumps health and human services secretary opened the seat up    won by at least 23 percentage points every time he was on the ballot since 2004. Mitt Romney carried the district by 23 points in 2012.  The only reason Democrats have even an inkling it could be competitive is that Trump collapsed here, besting Hillary Clinton by just 1. 5 points last fall.  That all means there are many more people who typically vote Republican in the district than Democrats.  Its created a rare scenario where the huge early vote turnout    140, 000 people have already cast their ballots, including 36, 000 who didnt vote at all in the April primary    could actually benefit Republicans.  The question is whether these scores of what have historically been reliably GOP voters are separating this race from their distaste for Trump and sticking with Handel    or have been turned off more broadly by the Republican brand under Trump and are willing to back Ossoff.  The 36, 000 voters who did not participate in the primary are perhaps the most baffling to both parties. Both sides have placed major emphasis on turning out voters who participated in Georgias presidential primaries last year but did not vote in April    and there are more Republicans than Democrats in that pool of potential voters.  What it all means: No one is quite sure what to expect, aside from a close race.  Democrats focus:   turnout, Democrats have placed a particular emphasis on turning out     voters. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has pumped hundreds of thousands into ads on black radio stations and digital ads, as well as $325, 000 for     mail pieces targeting those voters.  The makeup of the electorate is critical to watch. Ossoff has endorsements from two leading   Georgia Democrats    Rep. John Lewis, a civil rights icon, and Rep. Hank Johnson. But he is also just 30 years old and does not have   political connections through the district.  To win, Ossoff will need something approaching   turnout from Democratic base voters    and   are a crucial component of that base.  If Ossoff wins: Democrats will eye a majority, Ossoffs campaign has been a testing ground for Democrats hopes that Trumps unpopularity will allow them to compete for   seats in suburban areas across America.  Many of those districts are actually less Republican than Georgias sixth district. What they tend to have in common: Relatively highly educated, wealthy and diverse populations, plus people who    like thousands in Ossoffs district    voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and then backed Hillary Clinton in 2016.  An Ossoff win would be a proof point suggesting that Democrats are on the right track.  It would also be important in two other significant ways: Online,   fundraising has shattered records so far this year, and an Ossoff win would likely keep that money flowing in. And Democrats are deep into recruiting their crop of challengers for GOP seats in 2018 an Ossoff victory could embolden more top prospects to jump in.  If Handel wins: House GOP leaders can breathe easy, The outcome of Georgias contest is likely to become a prism through which congressional Republicans view Trump    a reality with major policy and political implications.  A spate of retirements from nervous incumbents who lack the stomach for a bitter   battle could be avoidable: A Handel victory could show worried party members    particularly those in suburban districts that Democrats are targeting    that they can still rely on a strategy of turning out their base in   districts, even if Trump is unpopular there. Shell have even helped write the playbook, after relentlessly working to tie Ossoff to Nancy Pelosi and hitting him on national security.  It would also make life easier for congressional GOP leadership, which cant afford to shed many votes from nervous members if it is to advance tax reform and health care legislation in the coming months.  But make no mistake: Republicans are closely watching the results to see just how much of a drag Trump is on Handel. Even a razor  win in a district where GOP congressional candidates typically top 60% would be a stark reminder of the wave potential of the 2018 midterms. After all, 71 incumbent Republicans sit in districts that are    per the Cook Political Reports partisan voter index    less   than Georgias 6th District.  A clear Handel win could show Republican lawmakers that theres no need to distance themselves from Trump    but anything short of that could send them scurrying from the President.   Was Ossoff too liberal or too moderate?  Ossoff became a fundraising phenomenon because he represented progressives best chance of swiping a House seat from Republicans early in the Trump presidency. He raised more than $23 million that way.  But if you watch Ossoff on the campaign trail or in TV ads, youd never know it.  Through the campaign, Ossoff was hesitant to even say Trumps name. Instead, he sold himself as a moderate who would happily work across the aisle, who fretted about deficit spending and who wasnt even sure hed vote for Pelosi for House speaker.  This reality has Sen. Bernie Sanders liberal wing of the party concerned that the Democratic establishment is recruiting and running too many moderates    and the establishment worried that Sanders insurgency could view a loss as proof the party needs to embrace a much more aggressive, populist,   message.  Sanders himself fed this narrative when he pointedly answered, I dont know, when the Wall Street Journal asked him this spring whether Ossoff is a progressive. Some Democrats are progressive, and some Democrats are not, Sanders said    though he later clarified that he does support Ossoff.  This could worsen tensions that already exist between the   left, which fumed over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committees refusal to spend heavily on races in Kansas and Montana, and the DCCC."

In Search of a Star: Desperate Democrats Turn to Losing Candidate Under Age 40 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,6/19/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     The Democratic Partys future in American politics is currently in such dire straits that the party has begun rallying around a failed Senate candidate as its potential future face. [With no deep bench ahead of the 2018 midterm elections   and the   looming 2020 presidential campaign, in which President Donald Trump will stand for reelection against a member of the Democratic Party   the Democrats have shifted their efforts to building up a literal loser from Missouri.  Despite Hillary Clintons   loss to Trump in Missouri last November,    Jason Kander     a former intelligence officer in Afghanistan who is the president of the Let America Vote PAC and now former Secretary of State of Missouri     lost to Sen. Roy Blunt ( ) by just a few points. Politico points out that Kander drew a slightly bigger crowd than Bernie Sanders had at the same event two years earlier and that hes kept doing   travel and generating   buzz, though the highest office hes ever held is secretary of state   of Missouri.  The fact that Democrats are seriously considering rallying behind someone who could not even hit 47 percent in a U. S. Senate race   Kander only managed to get 46. 4 percent of the vote in the general election   highlights the gravity of the predicament the party has slumped into since Clintons devastating loss in November. With a scarcity of national stars   Sens. Kamala Harris ( ) Cory Booker ( ) and Liz Warren ( ) really represent the only national Democrats with any profile at all   and a weak, aging bench, the Democrats are doing the unthinkable: Theyre looking to champion statewide candidates who lost last time, but got close to winning. A   poll by Morning Consult shows former Vice President Joe Biden as the Democratic bases favorite candidate, with a 74 percent favorability rating followed by Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) who had a 51 percent favorability rating. Clocking in at third and fourth places were Sen. Al Franken ( ) at 45 percent Sen. Cory Booker ( ) and Hillary Clintons former vice presidential nominee Sen. Tim Kaine ( )   tied at 37 percent. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo got 35 percent, and Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ) got 28 percent. Harris, a freshman U. S. Senator from California who has used the Russia hearings as a platform to fight with Trump administration officials, comes in next at 27 percent, while her colleague Sen. Chris Murphy ( ) places next after that with 23 percent. Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe got 22 percent, and Starbucks executive Howard Schultz and Montana Gov. Steve Bullock each tied with 21 percent. Sen. Amy Klobuchar ( ) got 20 percent, and then at 19 percent were a number of potential candidates including Kander. Kander was tied in 12th place with a 19 percent favorability rating. He was tied along with Gov. John Hickenlooper ( ) Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti ( ) and Disney CEO Bob Iger. Most of those Democrats are older. Franken is 66= . Kaine is 59, Biden is 74, Warren is 67, Hickenlooper is 65, and Iger is 66. Cuomo is 59. Gillibrand is 50. Harris is 52. McAuliffe is 60. Schultz is 63. Bullock is 51. Klobuchar is 57. Out of the list of potential 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who received 19 percent or higher approval rating on the Morning Consult poll, only three other than Kander   Murphy, Booker and Garcetti   are younger than 50. Murphy is 43, Booker is 48, and Garcetti is 46. Kander is the only under age 40. That is a distinctly different position from that of Republicans in recent years throughout the Obama administration, when several young Republicans were elected into senior positions throughout the country. From Gov. Scott Walker in Wisconsin to Sens. Ted Cruz ( ) and Marco Rubio ( )   among others   to even House Speaker Paul Ryan, Republicans found themselves with a deep bench walking into 2016. Trump, who just turned 71, ended up winning, however. But thanks to their deep bench, Republicans still control most levers of government at the state and national levels throughout the United States.   Democratic National Committee (DNC) chair Tom Perez, and his appointed vice chair Rep. Keith Ellison ( ) are charged with rebuilding the partys crumbling infrastructure as Republicans dominate both chambers of the U. S. Congress, a majority of governors mansions, a majority of statehouses, and now the White House. But in the absence of a true star, they have turned to last years crop of flops to find young, fresh blood   and the partys top figures are rallying behind Kander as their guy. Hes clearly a star and everybody knows it, Franken told Politico of Kander. Politico also wrote that Kander has been embraced by the insular Obama orbit and all but adopted by Joe Biden, who sees in Kander a little of his late son Beau, another earnest young Army veteran.  Interestingly, Politicos point that Kanders ability to draw bigger crowds than the aging Sanders does not necessarily translate into electoral success. Sanders also drew larger crowds that Clinton did, and he couldnt beat her. But Kanders appeal for the Democratic Party is tied as much to his age as how much better he did than Clinton in Missouri. In other words, he lost by less than she did. During an interview on Politicos Off Message podcast, Kander said, All I can tell you is what people say when they invite us. They say that they want me to come talk about the future of the party, how we were able to run 16 points ahead [of Clinton].  But there is no evidence yet that Kander can somehow translate his young energy into electoral success in a serious national election. The Democrats bench has been so depleted that their candidates are now forced to share the stage with political losers like Jason Kander, Missouri Rising Communications Director Jeremy Adler says. Newsflash to the former Missouri Secretary of State: you have to actually win   races if you want to become a national figure.  Speaking of which, Kander appeared in Georgia on Monday to rally for Democrat Jon Ossoff, who is running against former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel in the 6th congressional district for Dr. Tom Prices seat. Price was appointed by President Donald Trump as Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year. Ossoff has run his campaign on Bernie Sanders ideas and received the Independent, progressive Vermont senators endorsement earlier this year. As American Rising put it: Kanders appearance in Georgia today is great evidence for the problem Democrats are facing in a nutshell. Because their partys bench is so depleted, their candidates are now forced to campaign with political   that carry no weight and are more famous for their losses than anything else. For the sake of his own presidential ambitions, Kander better hope he doesnt transfer the losing gene to Ossoff before Tuesday. In an exclusive interview with Breitbart News on Monday, Handel said, There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing I have ever experienced. But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow.  Democrats are not expected to have a chance at retaking the U. S. Senate in the 2018 midterm elections, further complicating the partys   prospects. And Democrats will face an uphill battle in their fight to retake the House of Representatives, something that is by no means a guaranteed proposition walking into the   fight next year.

Sean Spicer might be leaving White House podium,CNN,Jim Acosta,6/19/2017,"Washington (CNN) The White House is mulling a new role for White House press secretary Sean Spicer that would take him away from the podium and into a different role inside the West Wing, a White House official said Monday. It remains unclear when the change might happen for Spicer, who for months has found himself at the center of discussions about a potential West Wing shakeup the official said the timing remains fluid.  It just seems chaotic, the official said. Both Politico and Bloomberg reported Monday that the White House is reevaluating Spicers role. The shakeup would cap off Spicers tumultuous   tenure at the White House podium, which made him not only one of the administrations most prominent personalities, but also the face of the White Houses unfocused messaging strategy. We have sought input from many people as we look to expand our communications operation, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement. As he did in the beginning, Sean Spicer is managing both the communications and press office.  Spicer began his tenure as White House press secretary by taking to the White House briefing room and criticizing reporters for the coverage of Trumps inauguration crowd size. In subsequent months, he would see the statements he made at the White House podium contradicted by the President    raising questions about the administrations credibility and Spicers ability to speak for Trump with confidence.  Spicers time at the White House briefing room podium in recent weeks has decreased amid rumors that Spicer would soon transition to a different role, with some suggesting the President was unhappy with Spicers performance in the   role. The daily briefings from the White House podium were frequently broadcast live on the major cable news networks and his combative    with reporters soon earned him a lampooning on  NBCs Saturday Night Live, where actress Melissa McCarthys portrayal of him has become a national sensation. UPDATE: This story has been updated to reflect earlier reporting by Bloomberg and Politico."
Supreme Court takes partisan gerrymandering case,CNN,Ariane de Vogue,6/19/2017,"Washington (CNN) The Supreme Court will take up the most important gerrymandering case in more than a decade, it announced Monday.  The case involves district lines in Wisconsin that challengers say were drawn unconstitutionally to benefit Republicans. The case could have a major impact on how district lines are drawn up nationwide. The court has said that too much partisanship in map drawing is illegal, but it has never said how much is too much.  Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, told CNN that this case could have enormous ramifications. Although a majority of the court has suggested that states can violate the Constitution if they draw legislative districts primarily to benefit one political party, the justices have never been able to identify the specific point at which states cross the constitutional line. In this case, a lower court held that Wisconsin had indeed crossed that line, he told CNN. He continued: If the justices agree, it would be the first time the court has articulated a constitutional rule in this context, which could    and likely would    have enormous ramifications nationwide. This will be the biggest and most important election law case in decades. However the Court rules will affect elections for years to come, Josh Douglas, a law professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law who specializes in election law and voting rights, told CNN. The court    after orders were released    issued a separate order granting Wisconsins request to freeze the current maps until the Supreme Court hears the case next term. The order was  . This move is a victory for Wisconsin. This is the second time justices have acted on gerrymandering this year. Earlier this year, justices sided with Democrats and civil rights groups who challenged the North Carolina maps arguing that they unnecessarily packed   into two districts. This made it easier for   to   incumbents to those two seats, but diluted their votes in surrounding areas. A federal   panel rightfully held that Wisconsin lawmakers drew maps for the benefit of their own political party, with little regard for the will of the voters, said Paul Smith, vice president of litigation and strategy at the Campaign Legal Center, who will argue the case before the Supreme Court. Partisan gerrymandering of this kind is worse now than at any time in recent memory. The Supreme Court has the opportunity to ensure the maps in Wisconsin are drawn fairly, and further, has the opportunity to create ground rules that safeguard every citizens right to freely choose their representatives."
Trump defiant as pressure grows,CNN,Stephen Collinson,6/19/2017,"Washington (CNN) America is edging ever closer to a new long, national nightmare, given President Donald Trumps explosive response to signs that special counsel Robert Mueller is approaching the epicenter of White House power. The investigation has taken a serious turn in recent days, raising the clear possibility that whether Mueller finds wrongdoing or not, a period of political stress and upheaval is inevitable.  Trump appears willing to test the bounds of convention and his own powers against a legal and political establishment that he believes is conspiring against him. The higher the pressure, the more defiant the President becomes    even if it puts him at odds with his legal team. Trump has decided that this is a political fight and hes going to fight it, a White House official told CNNs Jeff Zeleny. But the sense of chaos around the White House is deepening. The President again called the Russia probe a witch hunt over the weekend while a legal adviser tried to walk back Trumps admission Friday that he is under investigation. The MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the Witch Hunt, Trump tweeted on Sunday. The political stakes rose significantly in recent days amid signs the probe on Russian election hacking could eventually expand to consider Trumps actions. The President and his allies have declared open season on Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who is overseeing the probe.  You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people!  #MAGA. Trump said in a tweet last week that signified an attempt to undermine both men. The tweet sparked speculation that Trump may pull a nuclear option by firing Mueller and Rosenstein, a move senior aides have fervently advised against    given that it could provoke a constitutional crisis. It looks like we have got a simmering tea kettle here, and the President seems to be testing the waters about whether he ought to go ahead and fire Robert Mueller, said Richard   a former Watergate prosecutor who is now a CNN legal analyst. You dont mess with the criminal justice system in this way . .. the President is on very tenuous ground here,   told CNNs Don Lemon Friday. The   approach may have grave political consequences. Trump and his aides may well end up in the clear, but months of recriminations ahead will further polarize the capital and cast a shadow over his administration, which is already struggling for traction after a tumultuous first five months. If Mueller decides there is a case to answer for either the President or his aides in the issue of alleged collusion with Russia or over a potential   the political uproar will be incalculable. At best, it could further complicate Trumps efforts to pass a meaningful legislative agenda and ultimately his hopes of a successful presidency. At worst, it could force the nation to confront a third debate on whether to remove an elected President in just 45 years. The lessons of history suggest such traumas raise questions of political legitimacy and constitutional process that have the potential to sour life in Washington for years in the future. Trumps in a political fight and hes going to fight it Back in the present, the Presidents mood is fueling the sense of crisis. One thing weve learned I think from the testimony of multiple people now is the Presidents pretty fired up about this, OK? Republican Sen. Marco Rubio said on NBCs Meet the Press Sunday. He, from every pronouncement we have seen, feels very strongly that he did nothing wrong, and he wants people to say that, because he feels very strongly about it, Rubio said. I dont think thats a mystery. And hes expressing himself in that way. But the more frustrated that Trump gets, the more he often hurts himself politically.  A case in point is the firing of Comey and Trumps subsequent admission that he had Russia on his mind when he dismissed the FBI director, an admission that could provide a rationale for an obstruction of justice probe. Trump has a compulsion to   and is very pugnacious. I dont think it serves him well, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a Trump supporter, on ABCs This Week, adding that the President was right to be infuriated by this whole Russia baloney. Legal team contradicts the client, In another sign of the gravity of the situation, Trumps legal team blitzed Sunday talk shows to contradict the Presidents tweet Friday where he said he is already under investigation. The President is not a subject or target of an investigation. That tweet was in response to a Washington Post story that ran with five unnamed sources, without identifying the agencies they represented, saying that the special counsel had broadened out his investigation to include the president, said Jay Sekulow, a Trump legal adviser on CNNs State of the Union. Sekulow also opened a conflict between the Presidents political team and his legal one, hinting that the Presidents tweets should be discounted even though the White House said they are an authentic expression of his views. It was 141 characters. Theres a limitation on Twitter, as we all know, Sekulow said. Then, in a subsequent interview on Fox News Sunday, Sekulow sowed further confusion by saying Trump was under investigation    then denied he said anything of the sort. Special counsel moving forward, Law enforcement sources have told CNN that the special counsel is gathering information and considering whether there is evidence to launch a full scale obstruction investigation.  Muellers investigators have asked for information and will talk to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Adm. Mike Rogers, according to a source familiar with the matter.   Investigators have also sought information from recently retired NSA Deputy Richard Ledgett, according to the source. Ledgett wrote a memo, according to the source, documenting a conversation in which the president allegedly urged Rogers to help get the FBI to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation. Any confirmation that Mueller has expanded the investigation to consider whether the President obstructed justice with the Comey firing would carry no guarantee of a guilty finding. But it would deal a political blow to the White House in the battle of perception, since the idea that Trump is not under investigation has been at the centerpiece of his administrations defense strategy."
"A Mother Is Shot Dead on a Playground, and a Sea of Witnesses Goes Silent - The New York Times",New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,6/19/2017,"To the right of where the hooded gunman paused and lifted his revolver, Jessica Whites three young children were twirling down a pockmarked metal slide. They paid no mind to the swirl of life in the housing project playground around them: men rolling blunts at a graffitied concrete table, tenants playing bingo, rap and RB blaring from a boombox. Their mother, buoyant after a long day behind the counter at a Shake Shack, was sitting nearby on a   bench, unspooling her dream of getting her first apartment. Sorrows had come to her family in stampedes. First, her father and older sister were killed in an apartment fire in 1997, when Ms. White was 9. Next, in 2012, in a different tower of the same South Bronx project, her brother was lured into a stairwell and shot to death. But on this evening, Ms. White, 28, was telling her mother that after five stays in a homeless shelter, she had saved just enough to move into a place of her own. It was just after 10 on June 11, a busy Saturday night. The rain had stopped and the air was swampy. Ms. Whites children savored being outside their grandmothers stuffy   apartment, above the buildings boiler room. Five minutes, five minutes, five minutes! the children kept calling. Again and again Ms. White and her mother, Gola White, caved: O. K. five more minutes and were going inside the house.  The first gunshot exploded from the walkway, between two London plane trees. Mommy, the kids! Ms. White screamed. The kids! her mother yelled back. Ms. White bolted from the bench, her body low to the hopscotch court as she reached for Damian Jr. Jessiah and Danielle     3, 5 and 9     who were already scurrying toward her. A bullet whistled past the play set, passed through her left breast and pierced her heart. Ms. Whites brothers ran out of their apartment and cradled her as she took her last breaths. She joined the ranks of the unintended, as detectives call those who bleed over someone elses beef. In the days that followed, at marches and speeches and basketball games in Ms. Whites memory, everyone promised that the outcome would be different     that in 2016, with a plunge in crime freeing up police resources, a man could not shoot a young mother dead on a crowded playground and walk free. But tenants of the project, the John Adams Houses, say they got what they have come to expect in one of the poorest communities in the country: public safety on a budget. A $2, 500 reward for tips, the bare minimum. Detectives shouldering caseloads that, by July, already exceeded what the departments chiefs considered manageable over an entire year. Promises by a local police commander to look into adding tower lights at the playground, made more difficult by the fact that those he had     just two     were being used in other   spots. Detectives, in turn, were frustrated that even the killing of an innocent woman did not get the tip line ringing. Wanted posters with pictures of the gunman and his getaway car were torn off lampposts and trees. The young men at the playground claimed not to know a thing. Yall far from the hunch, one said in an interview, and left it at that, a line detectives heard again and again. The playground is deserted now. Tenants organized a nighttime   system in one of the   to keep out strangers with guns. And Gola White, who raised eight children in the Adams Houses, all of them homebodies with big, brown eyes, is trying in vain to move out before she loses another. With weariness more than anger, she said that the government skimps on public safety for black families like hers. She said she had asked the police about the $2, 500 reward, which was not   the reward offered this summer after a young white woman was killed while jogging in Queens, generating weeks of intense news coverage. I think its a racist thing     I cant beat around it, Gola White said. If you look at things on TV and somebody says, I need this donated, if theyre white, theyll get it faster than a black person.  Her daughters fianc, Damian Bell, was stung by an encounter about three weeks after her killing when he asked two patrol officers just outside the Adams Houses for an update. He said they did not recognize Ms. Whites name. They feel like we dont care, so they dont care, Diana Void, Mr. Bells mother, said of city officials. But its not everybody that doesnt care. Theres a lot of us who do care.  The crimes, the rivalries and, often enough, the gang or drug ties in a murder victims past usually fill the first pages of the manila homicide file. Before forensic evidence is back from the lab, that history acts as a road map for detectives. Ms. White was a blank page. The crime scene did not reveal any better clues. Witnesses heard anywhere from three to six shots, but detectives found only a single bullet: the one in Ms. Whites chest. They thought it was a . 38 caliber, but the bullet was so deformed that they could not say for sure. There were no fresh nicks on the trees, the jungle gyms or the church wall behind the playground that detectives noticed. No guns in the garbage chutes. And no bullet casings on the pavement or in the grass, which indicated that the weapon was a revolver. Virtually the only sign detectives found of anyone having been killed there was Ms. Whites black sneaker lying near the bench. Detective John Caruso and a team of 40th Precinct investigators set out to find surveillance video of the gunman fleeing. Some witnesses said he had made a sharp left onto East 152nd Street. Others were sure it was a sharp right. Detective Caruso pulled video from areas in both directions but found no trace of the   gunman or his pearly white sneakers. Their search was delayed by a problem technology could not solve. Many of the bodegas and barbershops in the neighborhood were closed the day after the murder, for the Puerto Rican Day Parade, so the police could not immediately access their cameras. Two days after the killing, Detective Caruso found crucial video of the gunman darting across East 152nd onto a side street. As he sprinted toward a getaway car, a   Volkswagen Jetta, the killer made a mistake: He rested his hand on the hood of an S. U. V. for balance, most likely leaving fingerprints. But by the time the detectives got the video and found the S. U. V. the prints were smudged and a dozen other hands could have left theirs. Likewise, images of the getaway cars license plate were too blurry for the Police Departments standard video software to enhance. Detective Caruso played the video again and again on his computer at home, looking in vain for any extra clues. The clock was ticking. Detectives in the 40th Precinct get four days to work a homicide before they start picking up other cases again     the robberies, the assaults and the grand larcenies that are the publics barometer of street crime and that can attract outsize attention from One Police Plaza. Every day without an arrest, the embers of the White case grew colder. It was the ninth murder logged this year by the precinct. With three more murders since, the precinct is the second deadliest in the city, behind the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn. Someone like that, with her kids, you take it personal and you take it home with you, Detective Caruso said. What else can I do? What angle can I go? Money and muscle have a way of making witnesses and crime victims around the Adams Houses forget a lot. Gola White worries that the $2, 500 offered by the city is no match for those forces, especially when drugs are involved, as detectives believe they may be in Ms. Whites killing. One of the men at the playground that night was a dealer who had recently gotten out of prison, said Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad. Witnesses said he had been rolling blunts at a concrete table where the White family usually sat, just a few paces in front of the bench they took that night instead. The dealer had once worked for a   drug boss and now wanted the crown for himself, residents said. So he recruited a few teenagers to sell for him around the Adams Houses, boys who used to go to school and were now causing headaches for their parents. Their wares were crack, powder cocaine and marijuana. The Adams Houses had been open territory since 2013, when the police and federal prosecutors stitched together wiretaps, surveillance and tips from street informants into a takedown of the drug ring that had controlled the development for more than a decade and killed Ms. Whites brother. Recently, a new dealer had looked to claim the project. The dealer with deeper roots told the interloper he had to leave. Detectives believe, in what they say is the most solid of many competing theories in Ms. Whites case, that the new dealer may have taken offense. He comes back there, fires some shots, just to show, You cant push me off this easy, Sergeant LoPuzzo said. And now a woman is dead.  The ebb and flow of drug violence never ends, residents say. The takedown of the drug ring gave way to a peaceful spell, but last year the tide started to turn again. Every time they shut down one, another one comes about, Gola White said of the drug crews. You want to take over the world.  In a community like the Adams Houses, densely packed and secluded, the crews exert insidious influence. Prosecutors said Gola Whites son Doneil White, who was killed in 2012, had been a   and   drug dealer. No one cared much about his sales except for Jamal Smalls, a leader of the Bloods gang who was nicknamed Poo Black (a spin on Winnie the Pooh) and Mack (for Machiavelli). Hundreds of pages of court transcripts detail how petty drug feuds, undetected in their early stages by the police, spawned fear that touched everyday citizens     as well as the   investment required of the authorities to snare a   killer who kept moving drugs, even from a Rikers Island jail cell. The first time Mr. Smalls tried to shoot Mr. White, on July 18, 2012, he wounded a bystander in the Adams Houses, who identified Mr. Smalls as the gunman to a state grand jury. Soon, prosecutors said, Mr. Smalls paid or tried to pay the victim to forget the man, confronted with his grand jury statements at a recent trial in Federal District Court in Manhattan, said he could not identify the shooter. The second time Mr. Smalls tried to shoot Mr. White, on July 25, he missed again, but a    girl was in the lobby and witnessed part of the setup. When she was called to testify, Mr. Smallss associates filled the court benches in front of her, causing her to break down in tears on the stand and equivocate for nearly half an hour before pointing him out. Mr. Smalls finally paid $10, 000 to a friend, nicknamed Boo Banger, to lure Mr. White into a project stairwell and kill him. During Mr. Whites autopsy, pathologists found an old bullet lodged in his pelvic bone from an earlier shooting in the same housing project. Ms. White and her mother attended Mr. Smallss trial dressed in memorial   emblazoned with Mr. Whites picture     a courageous statement, given that Mr. Whites daughter was wearing it on the day of her fathers funeral when Mr. Smalls pointed at it and taunted that he had got slaughtered.  Before Mr. Smalls was sentenced in August to 55 years in prison, a prosecutor, Joshua Naftalis, read a letter from Gola White. I dont think anyone can understand this pain unless they have been through it themselves, she wrote. I hope that no mother would have to go through the pain of losing not one but two children to gun violence.  The blacktop playground in the Adams Houses looked different when Ms. White was a little girl. There were concrete turtles to sit on and a net to climb where there are now plastic yellow cylinders to spin and a play set with a sailors wheel. Ms. White, ebullient and curious, used to run through the canyonlike corridors of the Adams Houses before heading to sleepovers in friends apartments. The police said they had been paying attention to a robbery crew there called Jack Boyz, and had arrested young men on theft and gun charges nearby in the days before Ms. Whites killing. But residents said they rarely saw officers patrolling for very long on foot. At night, the project takes on a whole nother life, said Gloria, 41, a family friend of the Whites, who like many people interviewed for this article declined to give her full name for fear of the killer. Officers make their rounds and check the roofs around 7 or 8 p. m. Gloria said, and then you see the drug addicts come out, you see the drug dealers come out, you see the riffraff.  After Ms. White was killed, almost no one played there tenants said ghosts had moved in. Most days, around the time school lets out and young men start flashing wads of cash and getting antsy, patrol officers pull a car onto the walkway and stand outside the playground. Young men have complained about police harassment, but many tenants are thankful for the heavier presence. As a patrol officer in the 40th Precinct in the   Detective Caruso had played stickball with boys in the neighborhood, among them the dealer who was rolling blunts in the park that night. That camaraderie opened doors when he got the White case. The dealer even invited Detective Caruso inside to speak with him and his mother. But he denied being the target. Another clue kept tugging at Detective Caruso. Surveillance footage at 745 East 152nd Street, one of the seven towers in the complex, had caught the gunman stepping onto the elevator from the 12th floor before he rode down, paced in the lobby, put a bandanna over his face and, after a minute of peering out the back door, strode toward the playground. An anonymous 911 caller identified a young man who lived in that building, whose apartment had been robbed several months earlier in what appeared to be either a search for drugs or an attempt to terrorize the mans family. But that lead took a puzzling turn when Detective Caruso, on a visit to the apartment of the drug dealer who the police were told was the target, discovered the young man who the 911 caller said was the gunman hanging out there, too. In the   squad room of the 40th Precincts station house, the air stagnant and the shades drawn, detectives debriefed people arrested in other crimes to see if they had heard anything about the White killing. But tips were sparse and hard to corroborate. Soon Detective Caruso was forced to divide his attention with other cases. By September, most of the squads detectives were handling more than 200 cases. Police officials said the department advises that 180 cases is manageable for the entire year. Two residents of the Adams Houses said in interviews that they recognized the gunman from a surveillance image posted by the Police Department     the same man who was identified by the anonymous 911 caller. They said he was in a gang and sold drugs around the playground. But they said that    life in the project came with enough threats, including sexual assaults in the stairwells, and that they feared cooperating with the police could get them killed. One of them also said that when he once reported being threatened elsewhere in the city, officers said they did not believe him. He acknowledged he may not have truly been in danger, but said that encounter with the police made him feel that my dignity is lost.  They were unaware there was any reward at all for tips. Other residents, and some retired detectives, were skeptical that raising it would make a difference. I dont need 22 bands     $22, 000     to give closure to the family, said one project resident, though, he added, it would be a bonus.  Some retired police officials said the White case looked especially neglected next to the investigation into the murder of Karina Vetrano later in the summer. The daughter of a retired city firefighter and neighbor of a police commander, Ms. Vetrano was raped and beaten during a jog through a park in Howard Beach, Queens. Her case was in the headlines almost every day for weeks, whereas Ms. Whites killing drew a few newspaper and television reports, laying bare the different treatment the news media often gives murder victims depending on their race and where they live. Before long, the city had installed eight surveillance cameras around the Queens park at a cost of $280, 000, using money from the borough presidents office. And Mayor Bill de Blasios office had put up a $10, 000 reward for tips on top of an additional $25, 000 from the Police Department and   foundations, funds that were not made available in Ms. Whites case. Unfortunately, the woman in the Bronx is being treated like collateral damage, said Thomas D. Nerney, a retired   veteran of the Police Department and a former detective on the Major Case Squad. Its a signal to the people in that area of the Bronx that if youre not   then you dont count. And that irks me.  The citys tips website, CrimeStoppers, lists two unsolved homicides in the Bronx with rewards above $10, 000. Since the beginning of 2015, there have been at least 122 felony crimes in and around the Adams Houses, according to a city crime map. By comparison, the killing of Ms. Vetrano in Queens was one of three felony crimes recorded within 10 square blocks over the same period. The Police Department pulled detectives from around the city to comb Ms. Vetranos crime scene, sampling every scrap for evidence. The playground at the Adams Houses had just the usual   crime scene team assisting the detectives. In an interview, the city councilman for that part of the Bronx, Rafael Salamanca Jr. said that the reward should be higher, but that he had not spoken to City Hall about it. He was distressed to hear about the experience of Ms. Whites fianc outside the housing project, when patrol officers had not known her name. These are the types of things that affect the   relationship, he said. Thats the kind of thing that makes the community feel like they dont care.  At a packed tenants meeting after Ms. Whites death, people said they were grateful for the additional patrols, but asked why it took a murder to get the police walking through the development. Maybe just for that one second that you walk past, you can stop, maybe slow the process or stop someone getting hurt, one woman called out to a police commander. Yall not God, yall cant see everything. But your presence walking through here would make a big difference.  After Gola Whites son was killed, she bought a burial plot for two. The second grave was going to be hers. She put a down payment on a tombstone, and gave her children instructions for adding an icon of an open Bible next to her name when she died. Instead, in June, she told the tombstone maker to add her daughters name. She is still $200 short of what she needs to get the black stone placed. Never in my imagination did I think I would be burying another one of my kids, Ms. White said. She often lies in bed awake past 3 a. m. She is cajoling city workers to help her move into other subsidized housing, among them the same official who had tried to get her a new apartment after her son was killed. One apartment the official offered her then was too small another was in a neighborhood where she said she had tense relationships. She cries when she wonders if she could have done more to protect her daughter. Her grandchildren no longer like being outside. A grandson, Tyshon, 5, heard a bang from workers taking down scaffolding after school and asked to go home. Another time, he dove under a play set when someone started lighting firecrackers. Every bang, every boom, everything he hears     if he hears people fighting     everything is just, I want to go in the house, I want to go home, when are we leaving?  Ms. White said. Early on, Jessica Whites younger two children, Damian Jr. and Jessiah, would sometimes tell their father, Mr. Bell, Go to the doctor and get Mommy.  The oldest, Danielle, had no choice but to confront what had happened. Her father showed her the Facebook page of a man he had heard committed the killing and asked if she recognized his face from the playground. One afternoon in July, Mr. Bells mother, Ms. Void, was doing the girls hair before a trip to the movies. Danielle, named after her mothers sister who had died in the fire, got it straightened with a flat iron. Jessiah had wanted a ponytail until she looked up at her sister. She decided she wanted the same. A   dropped by and kissed Danielle on the forehead. You looking just like your mama, he said. The girl took a look in the mirror to make sure."
Washington Redskins Spike Football After Asian Slants Bands Trademark Victory at Supreme Court - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel J. Flynn,6/19/2017,"The Washington Redskins won at the U. S. Supreme Court on Monday without taking a case there. [A unanimous court ruled that the government violated the First Amendment rights of the members of an Asian band calling itself The Slants by denying the group trademark protection.  The disparagement clause violates the First Amendments Free Speech Clause, Justice Alito explained in his Matal v. Tam opinion. Contrary to the Governments contention, trademarks are private, not government speech.  The Washington Redskins offered an amicus curiae brief supporting The Slants. The brief contended that nothing permits Congress to condition trademark registration on a mark owners refusal to change a name that the government finds odious.  A division of the United States Patent and Trademark Office voted to cancel a half dozen Redskins trademarks in 2014 based on the premise that the teams nickname   an offshoot of Red Sox from when the Boston Braves football team moved from Braves Field a mile or so away to Fenway Park in 1933 and became the Boston Redskins in homage to its landlord   violated a disparagement clause forbidding the registration of words and images that offend.

WaPo Admits Single-Payer Health Care Would be Astonishingly Expensive,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/19/2017,"The Washington Post dealt a blow to a liberal pipe dream Sunday when the outlets editorial board highlighted the problems with   health care      arguing that it would be astonishingly expensive unless doctors are paid less and Americans are prepared to accept different standards of access and comfort. [The piece, called   health care would have an astonishingly high price tag comes days after Californias Senate approved a   system for the state earlier this week, without having specified how it will pay for the estimated $400 billion price tag.    health care systems, such as those seen in Europe and Canada, have always been popular with the liberal wing of American politics, with top liberal Sens. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( ) calling for such systems in America. President Barack Obama also publicly supported   when he was a senator. The Post editorial is certainly sympathetic to those aspirations, arguing that such models are simpler for patients and employers. However, it says the governments price tag would be astonishing.  When Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) proposed a Medicare for all health plan in his presidential campaign, the nonpartisan Urban Institute figured that it would raise government spending by $32 trillion over 10 years, requiring a tax increase so huge that even the democratic socialist Mr. Sanders did not propose anything close to it. Countering the argument of   advocates that   systems tend to be more   than the American system, the Post says the reason for that is political, blaming Republicans for framing ObamaCares Medicare cuts as attacks on the program instead of reform. The Post argues that a   system would face the same political barriers and that consequently, the only way to make such a plan affordable would be to get medical employees to be paid less, and to get Americans to accept lower quality of care: A     system would face all of these political barriers to   reform and more. To realize the   dream of coverage for all and big savings, medical industry players, including doctors, would likely have to get paid less and patients would have to accept different standards of access and comfort. There is little evidence most Americans are willing to accept such tradeoffs. The Post reiterates that the goal must be universal coverage and cost restraint but that liberals should be directing their energy to goals other than a complete government takeover of Americas healthcare system. There are many options short of a disruptive takeover: the government can change how care is delivered, determine which treatments should be covered, control quality at hospitals, drive down drug costs and discourage     plans even while making the Obamacare system better at filling coverage gaps.

Supreme Court Strikes Down N.C. Law Barring Sex Offenders from Social Media - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/19/2017,"The U. S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously on Monday that a North Carolina statute that prevents registered sex offenders from accessing social media sites where children are known to be online violates the First Amendment. [The case, Packingham v. North Carolina, concerned a registered sex offender who posted an exuberant message on his own Facebook profile in 2010 thanking God for the fact that a court had dismissed a traffic ticket: Man God is Good! How about I got so much favor they dismissed the ticket before court even started? No fine, no court cost, no nothing spent. . . . . . Praise be to GOD, WOW! Thanks JESUS! He was convicted and given a suspended sentence.  The defendant appealed his conviction and sentence, and the state appellate court agreed with him that the state law was unconstitutional. The North Carolina Supreme Court, however, disagreed and upheld the law as constitutional, on the argument that it served a legitimate state interest in protecting minors, and that there were alternative sites on which sex offenders could communicate without the risk that they might gather information about minor children. The majority opinion, written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, held: A fundamental principle of the First Amendment is that all persons have access to places where they can speak and listen, and then, after reflection, speak and listen once more.  Social media, Kennedy wrote, is one of those places: On Facebook, for example, users can debate religion and politics with their friends and neighbors or share vacation photos. On LinkedIn, users can look for work, advertise for employees, or review tips on entrepreneurship. And on Twitter, users can petition their elected representatives and otherwise engage with them in a direct manner. While the law is content neutral, and therefore only subject to the standard of intermediate scrutiny, Kennedy wrote, it is not narrowly tailored to serve a significant governmental interest.  The law could theoretically bar access to newspaper websites as well, he added. The state could write a new law that was more specific in its application to the problem at hand, he suggested, such as prohibiting contacting a minor or using a website to gather information about a minor.  But the current law was far too broad, he said, because it bars access to what for many are the principal sources for knowing   rent events, checking ads for employment, speaking and listening in the modern public square, and otherwise exploring the vast realms of human thought and knowledge.  The liberal justices     Elena Kagan, Sonia Sotomayor, Stephen Breyer, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg     all joined Kennedys opinion. The conservatives     minus Neil Grouch, who was appointed too late to participate     joined a concurring opinion, written by Justice Samuel Alito, which agreed with the majority that the North Carolinas extraordinary breadth was a problem, but disagreed with what Alito called the majoritys undisciplined comments. Specifically, Alito argued, the Court went too far in suggesting that social media were like other public forums, which could be construed as meaning that the States are largely powerless to restrict even the most dangerous sexual predators from visiting any internet sites.  Alito wrote that the fatal problem for the law was that its wide sweep precludes access to a large number of websites that are most unlikely to facilitate the commission of a sex crime against a child. A handful of examples illustrates this point.  And yet, he added: But if the entirety of the internet or even just social media sites16 are the 21st century equivalent of public streets and parks, then States may have little ability to restrict the sites that may be visited by even the most dangerous sex offenders. May a State preclude an adult previously convicted of molesting children from visiting a dating site for teenagers? Or a site where minors communicate with each other about personal problems? The Court should be more attentive to the implications of its rhetoric for, contrary to the Courts suggestion, there are important differences between cyberspace and the physical world. In applying the First Amendment to the Internet, Alito concluded, we should proceed circumspectly, taking one step at a time.  Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

SCOTUS Throws Cold Water Early on Obamas Partisan Gerrymandering Project,Breitbart,Logan Churchwell,6/19/2017,"The U. S. Supreme Court made headlines Monday with its acceptance of a case that argues whether legislative maps can be ruled unconstitutional simply due to the partisan advantages that may be gained from their designs. Some election law experts contend the matter is a means to an end in transferring redistricting powers   commonly held in legislative branches   to commissions not directly answerable to the electorate. [Picking up the case after a   panel ruled that Wisconsin Republicans   legislative boundaries in 2010 with the intent to dilute opposition voting strength, the Supreme Court paused the lower courts immediate remedy that maps be reconfigured in time for the 2018 Election prior to the 2021 revamp. Court watchers of all varieties, including proponents of the lawsuit, took the halt as an early indicator that some   groups hopes for a new weapon against largely Republican legislatures may not be handed down any time soon.  Redistricting litigation is by no means a rarity, regardless of how far removed a case may be from the last decennial census or even if the boundaries are actually enforced at the time. Conventional scenarios allege that particular political jurisdictions are drawn presenting risks or evidence of racial discrimination, violating the U. S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. Gill v. Whitford, however, offers a different framework that the Supreme Court has demonstrated great difficulty in tackling in the recent past. Rather than making a detailed,   case that specific boundaries were drawn to harm minority voters, Whitford makes a broad argument against Wisconsins legislative boundaries statewide, arguing that Republicans are impermissibly tipping the scales at the expense of Democrat voters. Some critics of such maps also admit that a racial undercurrent can exist with a partisan gerrymandering complaint. In response, Wisconsin has pushed hard against the allegations and seeks a landmark ruling that partisan gerrymandering claims are not justiciable. The Supreme Court has been here before in 2004 thanks to a Pennsylvania case. The Court fractured on whether it should hear a partisan claim: Rehnquist, OConnor, Scalia, and Thomas found the case was governed by the   doctrine and lacked proper jurisdiction while Stevens, Ginsberg, Souter, and Breyer opted to proceed. Anthony Kennedy voted with the conservative bloc on the question of the Pennsylvania cases hearing, but would not foreclose future challenges. Typically a niche area even among the most dedicated politicos, redistricting has demonstrated improving   potential, especially as the Democrat Party continues to dedicate assets and architecture to chart a path out of the political wilderness. The Washington Post reported shortly after the court announcement Monday that former President Barack Obama would dedicate energy toward improving the partys chances in the next mapping cycle. In addition, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, chaired by former Attorney General Eric Holder and Clinton campaign alum Marc Elias promises a comprehensive,   Democratic Party redistricting strategy over the next 5 years and beyond.  Instead of fighting for the civil rights of all voters like previously advertised in   ID campaigns, the Democrats make clear their intentions: [T]he NDRC was created in 2016 to build a targeted,    strategy that ensures Democrats can produce fairer maps in the 2021 redistricting process. With fairer maps, Democrats can rebuild the party from the state level, and secure a stable federal majority for the decade to come. Looking beyond Whitford, some election law experts note that   reform efforts are coalescing around the concept that removes legislators   and their constituents by extension   further from the redistricting process favoring of a commission approach like seen in a dozen states. Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Hawaii, Idaho, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Washington currently utilize such systems. The makeup of the bodies can range in size and placement mechanism   commonly relying on executive or legislative leadership to select participants. Iowa utilizes a hybrid format while Ohio is slated to join the cohort in the next mapping cycle. Critics argue that a disconnect from the full wrath of the electorate is harmful.   independent commissions remove accountability   commissioners are not accountable to voters for what they do, unlike legislators, says Hans von Spakovsky, a senior legal fellow for the Heritage Foundation. Commissioners just move the politics of redistricting behind closed doors.  Experts commonly note that the electoral yields of a map are not neatly predetermined by the political affiliation of its architect. Both the 2006 Thumping and 2010 Shellacking Elections occurred on largely the same body of legislative maps. Real redistricting reform, some argue, happens in the ballot box. If you dont like the partisan results in a redistricting plan passed by a legislature, go out and win more seats, Public Interest Legal Foundation President J. Christian Adams explains. The people should have the power to form their own legislative system and that should not be delegated to bureaucrats and commissions just because we dont like the outcome.  The Supreme Court recently waded into the redistricting wars in 2016 with a Texas case, Evenwel v. Abbott. Though not regarding any specific political boundaries, Evenwel sought a ruling that would prevent jurisdictions be drawn based on the total population of residents opting instead for lines based on citizenship data or registered voters. Plaintiffs argued that current practices gave densely populated areas a political subsidy of added representation thanks to the counting of noncitizens and others not eligible to vote. The   court ruled unanimously against the plaintiffs, though Justice Clarence Thomas noted in a concurring opinion that it was not the Courts place to weigh in on such matters   a sentiment that might be repeated in Whitford soon.

Supreme Court Strikes Down Ban on Racially Disparaging Trademarks - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/19/2017,"The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Monday, holding that a law prohibiting disparaging trademarks violates the First Amendment. [The unanimous Court in Matal v. Tam struck down a provision of the Lanham Act, the main law on trademarks, that barred the Patent and Trademark Office from issuing any trademark protections to marks that may disparage        persons, living or dead, institutions, beliefs, or national symbols, or bring them into contempt, or disrepute.   This case concerned a rock band called the The Slants, a reference to the racial slur for Asians. When Simon Tam, the bands   frontman, tried to register his groups name with the trademark office, he was told he could not get a valid trademark because the name was offensive to Asians. Before the Court, Tams attorneys argued that his intention was to reclaim the term slants and subvert its offensive potential. The   provision, 15 USC 1052( a) has rarely had any practical effect, but has come to public notice in recent years as   advocates and public officials sought to use it to invalidate offensive trademarks. Most prominently, the Washington Redskins football team, who have twice had their trademark protections revoked for having a name that disparages American Indians. Writing for the Court, Justice Samuel Alito reasoned that the entire purpose behind the provision rendered it facially unconstitutional. It offends a bedrock First Amendment principle: Speech may not be banned on the ground that it expresses ideas that offend, he wrote. In contravention of this principle, the Patent and Trademark Office devised a test to determine whether a trademark was too offensive for the federal government to protect. If a substantial composite, although not necessarily a majority, of the referenced group would find the proposed mark . . . to be disparaging in the context of contemporary attitudes, the trademark could not be registered. This test, by disfavoring a certain subset of speech specifically on the view it expressed, constituted viewpoint discrimination, a fundamental limit on governments power to regulate private speech. The provision was not saved by the governments arguments that trademark protection was a matter of government speech or was a subsidy over which the first Amendment did not apply in its broadest sense. If private speech could be passed off as government speech by simply affixing a government seal of approval, government could silence or muffle the expression of disfavored viewpoints, the opinion reads: Holding that the registration of a   converts the mark into government speech would constitute a huge and dangerous extension of the   doctrine, for other systems of government registration (such as copyright) could easily be characterized in the same way. A concurring opinion by Justice Anthony Kennedy and joined by the Courts more liberal justices, called the policy the essence of viewpoint discrimination, and determined there was no need to even consider the government speech and subsidy arguments. The same law was held unconstitutional on the same grounds by an en banc panel of the Federal Circuit in 2015. The government, then represented by   Solicitor General Donald Verrilli, petitioned to the Supreme Court in a last attempt to save the law. Mondays ruling by the nations highest court cements the end of the seldom enforced provision."
St. Louis Cardinals Refuse to Bow to LGBT Demands to Punish Christians,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/19/2017,"The St. Louis Cardinals have sponsored Christian Day for 30 years, but recently gay activists have begun to pressure the Major League Baseball team to cancel the special day, or at the very least to remove former Cardinals star Lance Berkman as the events spokesman. To its credit the team has rejected the demands. [Gay activists are upset that the Cardinals have allowed Berkman to be the spokesman of Christian Day because he recently spoke out against transgender boys posing as girls in school locker rooms. As Paul Mirengoff reported, Berkman said:  The issue is, what to do about a 15 or    boy who thinks hes a girl and wants to shower with the girls. Maybe he is [transgender] maybe hes confused. But I wouldnt want him in the shower with my daughters. We shouldnt have the rights of 2 percent of the population trump the rights of the other 98 percent. In an interview, Berman added, To me, tolerance is the virtue thats killing this country. Were tolerant of everything. You know everything is OK, and as long as you want to do it and as long as it feels good to you then its perfectly acceptable do it. Those are the kinds of things that lead you down a slippery slope, and youll get in trouble in a hurry.  LGBTQ in St. Louis was outraged by the players comments. A spokesman for St. Louis Pride said they were disappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning.  To their credit, the Cardinals have resisted the demands made by the   activists to remove Berkman or cancel the July 30 Christian Day promotion. In a statement, the team said it sees nothing wrong with its sponsorship of Christian Day. The Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades, the team said in its statement. The   event usually features a   keynote speaker (often a former Cardinal or professional athlete) who talks about his or her experience of being a practicing Christian in the public arena. Lance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith.  The ball team points out that it has a large number of special promotional days to bring members of the community together. As an organization, the Cardinals have always been committed to bringing   groups together to share in the unifying experience of Cardinals baseball, the statement continued. We are an inclusive organization with a social responsibility to be welcoming to all types of people and organizations. We continue to try and reach out to every part of our community, and have hosted a variety of themed events like Christian Day, Jewish Community Night, Catholic Family Night, Bosnian Heritage Night, Fiesta Cardenales, and many others. We are excited to announce that we will be hosting our first Pride Night later this season (details to follow shortly) which will bring members of the LGBT Community together to enjoy Cardinals baseball.  Despite the pressure, the Cardinals have signaled full speed ahead with its Christian Day promotion.

Judicial Watch: Susan Rice Unmasking Documents Moved From NSC to Obama Library,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,6/19/2017,"The National Security Council cannot hand over records relating to former National Security Adviser Susan Rices surveillance of Americans, because they have been moved to the Obama presidential library and may be sealed for as many as five years, conservative watchdog Judicial Watch announced Monday. [The NSC informed Judicial Watch in a letter dated May 23 that materials related to Rices requests to know the identities of Americans swept up in surveillance of foreign targets, including any Trump campaign or transition officials, have been moved to the library.  The NSCs Director of Access Management John Powers said in the letter: Documents from the Obama administration have been transferred to the Barack Obama Presidential Library. You may send your request to the Obama Library. However, you should be aware that under the Presidential Records Act, Presidential records remain closed to the public for five years after an administration has left office. Judicial Watch earlier this year filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request for those documents, including of communications between Rice and any intelligence community member or agency regarding any Russian involvement in the 2016 elections, the hacking of Democratic National Committee computers, or any suspected communications between Russia and Trump officials. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the group will seek to find out when the records were moved, and warned of legal actions. He said: Prosecutors, Congress, and the public will want to know when the National Security Council shipped off the records about potential intelligence abuses by the Susan Rice and others in the Obama White House to the memory hole of the Obama Presidential Library. We are considering our legal options but we hope that the Special Counsel and Congress also consider their options and get these records. In April, blogger Mike Cernovich, Bloomberg, and Fox News revealed that Rice had requested to unmask     or unveil the hidden names of     Trump transition officials who were caught up in surveillance of foreign targets. Typically, in surveillance of foreign targets communications, U. S. citizens mentioned or participating in them would have their names masked, or hidden, due to ethical, legal, and privacy concerns. However, government consumers of the intelligence can request to have their names unmasked if it is important to understanding the communications. According to Cernovich, The White House Counsels office identified Rice as the person who had requested the unmasking, after examining her log requests, Cernovich reported on April 2. Bloomberg and Fox News would later corroborate the report. The revelation lent credence to Trumps assertion that the Obama administration had been surveilling his transition team. The Wall Street Journal editorial board has argued Rice had no reason to request the unmaskings. Since then, the House intelligence committee has also subpoenaed the intelligence community for information on unmasking requests by Rice, former CIA Director John Brennan, and U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power. The misuse of unmasking came under media scrutiny after U. S. officials illegally leaked to the Washington Post a private conversation between former Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak on December 24. Flynn resigned after those communications, not because anything inappropriate was found, but because he had misrepresented those communications to Vice President Mike Pence.

Moby Music Video Blows Up Cartoon Nazi Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/19/2017,"The music video for electronic   Mobys latest song depicts President Donald Trump as a Nazi robot who is eventually blown up by a band of rebellious citizens. [The   video for Mobys song In This Cold Place sees an evil capitalist Trump, who transforms into a flying swastika money symbol, in a battle to take over a slowly decaying world. Visuals in the trippy video include a border wall, President Richard Nixon with a   nose that grows and wraps around the world, and several popular cartoon characters, including   the Care Bears, Mickey Mouse, and Mario.  As time has passed, Ive wanted more and more for my work to somehow reflect my political concerns and my world views and issues that are important to me, Moby told HuffPost about working on his latest project. Ive realized that music videos are just a really good way of trying to do that.  The dystopian and extreme illustrations were created by English animator Steve Cutts, who Moby demanded push his creative limits. Oh, do you think we can get away with this?  Moby recalled Cutts asking. And I was like, yeah, why not, just make it, go as far you want.  By the end of the music video, Trump is blown up in an uprising and all antagonists are destroyed. One scene sees the cartoon protagonists banishing an evil Rupert Murdoch, Theresa May, Kim Jong Un, and a   Steve Bannon. The    singer says hes not concerned about depicting violence against President Trump landing him in legal trouble, like it did Kathy Griffin, so much as he is worried about his new music video being banned from social media sites. The criteria that you would use to determine where you draw the line is simply whats effective and whats legal, said Moby. And I dont mean legal in a cowardly way. I mean legal in a way that would lead something to be taken off the internet. Because you can make the best content in the world but if YouTube and Facebook wont let people see it, then whats the point of having this great content.  In This Cold Place will appear on Mobys new album, More Fast Songs About the Apocalypse, which was announced last week. Moby took to Twitter Monday to announce the release of his music video, which he described as a masterpiece.  The dance music icon has long been a vocal opponent of President Trump. Days after the election, Moby wrote an open letter to the American people asking what the f*ck is wrong with them. In February, the    DJ claimed to be in possession of intelligence that proves that the Trump administration is in collusion with the Russian government.

"A Shooting, the Hospital and Then, Months Later, Its a Homicide - The New York Times",New York Times,Al Baker and Benjamin Mueller,6/19/2017,"The gunshot survivor, frozen from the waist down, a .  bullet lodged between his left kidney and lowermost rib, lay on a hospital bed looking at mug shots of South Bronx gang members. Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo asked the man whether he could pick out his shooter. Yep, Bruce Purdy answered, looking spent. Then he handed back the 8     booklet, with 23 photos. Who? Mr. Purdy would not say. Soon, he told Sgt. LoPuzzo, the police would hear about a crazy man in a wheelchair shooting the person who had put him there. Then youll know who it was, Mr. Purdy said. The   threat only hinted at Mr. Purdys scorn for the system. Raised during a crack plague, he was a child of government institutions     a   foster homes, a city jail, six state prison facilities, public housing       who, at 29, had landed at yet another: Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center, a red brick monument to both   emergency treatment and overburdened recovery care where most gunshot victims in the South Bronx are taken. Detectives began to make regular trips to Mr. Purdys bedside in Room 6C at the hospital after the shooting in October. But he was unswayed: Having been robbed of sex and the use of his legs, he said, all he had to look forward to was getting revenge. Then one night in December, a week after Mr. Purdy had left the hospital against doctors orders with little more than a basic wheelchair, he fell short of breath, was picked up by an ambulance and, in the same emergency room that had tended to his gunshot wound, died of a blood clot. A   investigation by the New York City medical examiner traced the fatal clot to the shooting, and on March 14, Mr. Purdys death was added to this years homicide tally for the 40th Precinct, a section of the South Bronx where violence takes diverse paths to death. To understand what drives such violence, The New York Times is documenting each murder logged in the 40th Precinct this year. The killing of Mr. Purdy counted as the fourth homicide there two more have since been recorded, making the 40th the   precinct in New York City in 2016. Mr. Purdys murder is perhaps the precincts truest mystery this year. The killer remains on the loose, the beneficiary of a lack of cameras outside the public housing building near where Mr. Purdy was shot and a reluctance on the part of his companions and other witnesses to cooperate with the police. He carried his silence to the grave. Beyond the detectives, Mr. Purdy also gave up on Lincoln Medical Center in his last weeks. He resisted physical therapy. He told relatives he had been left to lie for hours in his own excrement. He lit his bedsheets on fire, and cursed and yelled at doctors to send him home. The hospital, in turn, said in medical records that it was unable to do more for Mr. Purdy. Doctors tried for weeks to find a bed at a rehabilitation center     especially difficult for patients on Medicaid     only to have him change his mind on the day of his discharge and go home. He told a nurse he planned to kill himself but was never admitted to a psychiatric ward. The records are not clear about whether he went home with a prescription for   medicine his mother said he did not. Saving Mr. Purdy from a bullet in the back was not enough. The poor pockets of the Bronx from which he carved his itinerant life created hurdles that made it hard for a gunshot survivor to stay alive. Mr. Purdys long path to death wound through a bathtub in a   project where a brother lifted his limp 181 pounds in and out of the water. Before that, Mr. Purdy lingered for six weeks at Lincoln Medical Center, a   hospital for trauma care that     like many institutions across the country     struggles to care for paraplegics. This is just another case where societys ability to care for people in a multidisciplinary way is not always so perfect, especially in underserved populations, said Dr. Ronald Simon, the former chief of Lincolns trauma division and one of the doctors who oversaw Mr. Purdys treatment. While the challenges of his care illuminate broad problems in how the health care system treats the poor and permanently disabled, Dr. Simon and outside medical experts said the hospital appeared to have met the relevant treatment standards and that Mr. Purdy might have unwittingly hastened his death by leaving. He spent much of his last 47 days trying to prove he could return from injury and get justice on his own, without the help of doctors or detectives. Mr. Purdys mother, Thelma Johnson, believes her son would still be alive had doctors treated him more thoroughly at discharge. When he left, she said, they didnt do nothing but give him a wheelchair.  Hanging on her wall at a homeless shelter on the Grand Concourse in the Bronx is a red   she pulled off his body in the emergency room, near a box containing his ashes. One day, she said, Im going to get some money and buy an urn for them.  Mr. Purdy was shot in a void: a stretch of sidewalk unwatched by the citys extensive   surveillance equipment, outside the reach of cameras, floodlights or gunshot detectors. It was 9 p. m. on Oct. 28, and he had been hanging out in Apartment 3C at 517 East 144th Street, a   building at the Betances Houses, a   project. He was with Yesenia Figueroa, the wife of his best friend, Shamel Robinson. The two had gone to court earlier after Mr. Robinson was arrested in the apartment early that day for having a loaded   .  pistol. (Mr. Robinson told officers he had gotten the gun after an argument at a bodega, according to court papers.) Mr. Purdy stepped outside to get chips and a soda. Ms. Figueroa, who has a history of arrests for prostitution, stayed inside. The apartment     sparsely decorated, with a curtain marking off one area     is home to a cast of transients. Mr. Purdy told detectives at one point that Ms. Figueroa was his fiance, though she told a reporter they were only close friends. Steps from the buildings front door, a gunman came up from behind and fired two shots, the second going deep into Mr. Purdys back. He fell between two parked cars. RRN! the gunman yelled, Mr. Purdy told detectives, referring to a gang that, the police said, reigns in the Betances Houses and was behind a surge in shootings in the 40th Precinct that hit a recent peak of 72 in 2011 amid a feud with gang members from the nearby Moore Houses. Mr. Purdy told his sister Precious Parker that the gunman also screamed, You on my block.  Mr. Purdy told detectives that he had thought about playing dead, but it was too late. His eyes were still open and twitching when the gunman stood over his body. Then, inexplicably, the gunman uncocked his pistol and walked away. Im shot. Im down, Miss, Im down. Please, Mr. Purdy told a 911 operator on his cellphone as he lay there alone. The operator mixed up the street name Mr. Purdy repeated it. When she asked him several times who shot him, he said he did not know. He grew more desperate as seconds ticked by. Maam, maam, hurry up, theres people coming, he said. Please hurry up.  Of the gunman, he said: They ran off, I think. Im afraid.  There was no blood at the scene the slug had spared major blood vessels on the way to Mr. Purdys spine. At the hospital, Mr. Purdy lurched between being depressed and being sanguine about his recovery, according to medical records his mother received. He had once dreamed of being a doctor and had studied nursing in prison. Now he was a case study in the physical devastation and psychological ripples that result from surviving a shooting. The bullet had shattered two of the strongest vertebrae, in the small of his back, nudging his spinal cord to the right. He lost movement and feeling in his lower half. Roughly one in four trauma cases at Lincoln Medical Center involve penetrating trauma     gunshots or knife wounds     compared with about 5 percent at most private hospitals, and so a trauma surgeon is always on duty. Mr. Purdy spent his time in Room 6C learning to shift from his bed to a wheelchair and being taught to insert a catheter to urinate. On Nov. 5, the day he was to have the bullet removed, he declined to be operated on, a decision that may have increased his back pain later. Doctors deemed him a very high risk for deep vein thrombosis, or blood clots in the legs, a notorious danger for paraplegics that stems from the loss of movement. He was treated with Lovenox, an injectable drug to prevent blood clots. Doctors say typical standards call for such patients to continue preventive treatments for at least three months, possibly six, sometimes forever. Starting around 2004, the citys public hospitals undertook a   effort to address what Dr. Robert S. Kurtz, a trauma specialist who helped lead the push, called a national problem of failing to prevent deep vein thrombosis. He said city hospitals had raised their compliance rate above 90 percent. Reeling from his injury, Mr. Purdy clashed with medical staff members, refusing at first to discuss his family situation or mental state. Two days after the shooting he threatened to slide onto the floor unless someone brought him a wheelchair. Doctors said he had adjustment disorder, a response to   trauma. Mr. Purdys mother said his cousins took him cigarettes to smoke in bed. Having lost control of his bowel movements, he told relatives that nurses had left him sitting in his own excrement for hours. On Nov. 19 at around 2 p. m. a social worker, Maria   told him that he had not been doing physical therapy sessions. He replied that an attendant had tried to take him to therapy without cleaning the stool he had been lying in for three hours. He recorded his   conversation with Ms.   and a physical therapist, Michael Santoro. Mr. Purdy says of the physical therapy, How am I going to go if Im sitting in excrement? On the video, Mr. Santoro can be heard telling Mr. Purdy his health has improved and that he can go home, but Mr. Purdy asks how they know. He says he has not seen them in five days. Ms.   replies, You saw me like four days ago, not counting the weekend.  They ask Mr. Purdy whether he can think of any other equipment he would need. Mr. Purdy sounds confused. They abruptly end the conversation, making preparations for Mr. Purdys discharge, possibly the next day. The discussion was scattered, superficial, totally disconnected     its pathetic, said Dr. Kurtz, former director of service for trauma and surgical critical care at Kings County Hospital Center and one of three doctors who reviewed the video and Mr. Purdys medical records at the request of The New York Times. He cautioned that the encounter showed only a snapshot of his care. Its a religion to take care of a spinal cord patient. Its a massive undertaking.  The city hospital system said in a statement, The video demonstrates that the hospital staff were actively developing a safe and appropriate discharge plan.  Mr. Santoro, asked about the video, said: I gave him the best care I could, we all did. There was no improper care by me.  Ms.   who has since left the hospital, declined to comment through her husband. On Nov. 26, Thanksgiving Day, at 7:34 p. m. with a TV commercial hawking holiday deals playing in the background, Mr. Purdy recorded another video. He lay naked on his bed, with a clump of stool and dirty wipes next to him. Speaking into his cellphone camera, he said he had been waiting 25 minutes for help. This is embarrassing, man, he said, aiming the camera out the open door. You got guests, you got all sorts of people just walking by, door open. Look at me, look at me.  He panned the camera to the pile of waste beside him. Paraplegic patients often languish without thorough and affordable care. Sound recovery requires, among other things, buying a special bed for home and teaching a patients relatives to give an enema. But doctors say that outside of Veterans Affairs hospitals, treatment often neglects even simple needs. The care is fragmented, its scattered, it depends on the whim and the will of individuals, Dr. Kurtz said, adding that there was a crying need for more seamless programs. A patient like Mr. Purdy could have left the hospital after as little as two weeks for a    rehabilitation center, Dr. Simon said. But while he estimated that 20 local rehabilitation centers would have taken Mr. Purdy if he had insurance, far fewer would have done so without insurance. So he ended up staying at Lincoln for a more prolonged time until they found him a bed, Dr. Simon said. The city hospital system said there was pressure from the federal government, in the form of financial penalties for delays, to move patients to rehabilitation centers. It did not take long for Mr. Purdy to spiral into desperation. Patient started a fire by smoking and burning the bedsheet with the cigarettes stating to the nurse, I will set more fire in the room to kill myself and the rest of the people, say medical records from six days after he was shot. Mr. Purdy told a nurse he had started to work out the details of how to kill himself and intended to carry out his plan. For a time, a health aide watched him around the clock. A psychiatrist followed up the next day to assess his capacity to make decisions. But the limited mental health care documented in the medical records provided to Ms. Johnson surprised some of the doctors interviewed for this article. Ms. Johnson said she had asked twice for her sons full case file and specifically for his psychiatric records, but doctors who reviewed the documents said they appeared incomplete. The city hospital system said all records had been provided. Mr. Purdy later denied being suicidal. Dr. Simon noted that trauma care was often the first encounter with doctors in many years for young victims of violence in the South Bronx. Mr. Purdys mother and sister visited a few times a week, but without a regular family presence, the burden on him only grew. He repeatedly asked to go home, only for doctors to talk him out of it. Lincoln finally secured a bed for him in rehabilitative care at the citys Metropolitan Hospital Center in East Harlem. An ambulance was arranged to take him at 1 p. m. on Dec. 7. But he changed his mind. Medical notes quote him telling attendants he was going home because someone had lost his belongings. Doctors enlisted a psychiatrist to evaluate whether they could keep Mr. Purdy in the hospital. Medical notes say he showed magical thinking in believing that he would walk again, but he was deemed not delusional.  Doctors concluded it would be illegal to hold him against his will. Dr. Simon, who was not involved in Mr. Purdys discharge, said he has had patients insist on leaving before, even when he told them they risked dying. And theyre like, I dont care, he said. Thats a sticky situation once you leave against medical advice.  Mr. Purdy was told about the risks of blood clots, encouraged to exercise and stop smoking and educated on an injection for blood thinners, records show. But the records do not include a clear list of prescriptions he received at discharge. His family said he did not return home with a   prescription or medication. Ms. Parker, Mr. Purdys sister, whose public housing apartment doctors noted he was going to, said she was not informed of the risk of blood clots or how to help prevent them. Dr. Michael M. Baden, a former New York City chief medical examiner, said that proper administration of blood thinners would very likely have prevented the fatal clots. His   decision to go home would have made any plan more difficult to enforce. Dr. Kurtz said that he would have prescribed a blood thinner for home use, but that other doctors might reasonably have decided otherwise. He said he understood why someone as distraught and isolated as Mr. Purdy would have left against medical advice. One of the cousins who had been delivering him cigarettes rolled Mr. Purdy out in his wheelchair. Mr. Purdy came home to a family that hardly knew him. His own    daughter was in foster care, sent there in 2012 after he fought with the girls mother. It was a fate he knew himself. Around 1990, New York Citys child welfare agency took Ms. Johnsons seven children from her home. Mr. Purdy was 5. His mother was sprinkling crack cocaine on cigarettes     she liked the smell of the drug mixing with tobacco     and smoking crack rocks from pipes. It was the tail end of an era when the crack cocaine trade drove violence across the city and left many children in broken homes. That began an institutional odyssey, as Mr. Purdy and his siblings bounced through five foster homes across the city together, rebelling at every turn and sometimes running away, Ms. Parker said. The most difficult siblings, Mr. Purdy among them, were separated and scattered across Long Island and the city. He landed in a Brooklyn home and at age 13, he joined the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, a local affiliate of the national Crips gang, he told a detective during a 2010 arrest. He looked at it like his family, said Mr. Robinson, his friend, who also grew up in foster care. He didnt have his real family.  Around age 14, the two of them landed at an alternative school in Yonkers, where they bunked next to each other. Mr. Purdy told Mr. Robinson that he wanted to pursue a music career, and maybe become a doctor. They finished school, Mr. Robinson said, before moving into a group home in the northern Bronx that helped them look for jobs and took them to Six Flags and Disney World. But Mr. Purdy had inherited some of his parents drug habits, first smoking a joint around 15, Ms. Johnson said. Thats what we do, said Ms. Johnson, who started smoking marijuana at 9. Thats just what we do.  Ms. Johnson recalled telling mourners at her sons funeral that he had tested her patience as a boy, running in from the street and sticking his hands in pots for an early taste. That was me and his biggest problem, she said. But he grew more bitter in later years. He would sometimes meet his mother on the streets after running away from foster homes. As they parted, he would call out, just loud enough to hear, Crackhead.  I thought I was paranoid, that I was just hearing things, Ms. Johnson said. But thats how he really felt about me.  She trailed off, clapping her hands, upset at the memory.   people told the police they heard gunfire from Mr. Purdys shooting. But none reported seeing anything, using some version of a mantra that has wearied generations of Bronx detectives: Heard shots, saw nothing.  Detectives combed Mr. Purdys arrest record. (Over the years, he had used four different names     Mike Johnson, Bruce Cobb, Bruce Cobbs and his real name.) Many of his 23 arrests were for petty crimes, but some were for selling drugs, suggesting the possible role of narcotics or gangs in the shooting. His most serious crime came in 2009, when he choked a man from behind as two friends beat him and stole a cellphone and wallet. He pleaded guilty to   attempted robbery in 2011, after having served nearly 20 months at Rikers Island. He was in and out of state prison on parole violations until December 2014. He foretold his problems in a Facebook post the next year: When I married the streets, he wrote, I knew she made your heart cold and would eventually take everything from you.  But the Shotgun Gangsta Crips, Mr. Purdys gang, was not known to be in conflict with gangs in the Betances Houses. He had little history in the South Bronx many of his arrests were farther north, near his old group home. Mr. Purdy told relatives he believed the gunman had walked away while he was still alive because the man had mistaken him for someone else. A young man was arrested in a shooting using a .  gun at the same housing complex in April, and he said in an interrogation that the word on the street was that Mr. Purdys shooting was a case of mistaken identity. Without video footage, Detective Richard Simplicio said he made at least four visits to Mr. Purdys bedside, trying to get him to say what he knew. On one occasion Mr. Purdy commented on Detective Simplicios    Nike Dunks, leading to a conversation between sneaker buffs. He felt comfortable, the detective said. Unfortunately not comfortable enough to assist in the shooting.  Detective Simplicio said he sympathized. At the end of the day, too, were not with them 24 hours a day, he said, were not there for the most part to help them out.  Ms. Figueroa, his friend, rebuffed detectives twice. She and her husband, Mr. Robinson, had their own criminal cases, with Ms. Figueroa toting her baby in a carrier to an April court appearance for Mr. Robinson. He said he was in jail when he learned that his friend had died. Investigators believe Mr. Purdy told people close to him before he died that the man who had shot him was someone he had seen before. But detectives were counting on having more time to build a rapport with Mr. Purdy, to persuade him to cooperate rather than face the repercussions of his own revenge. Detective Simplicio said, Obviously I didnt think he was going to, you know, die, after he got cut loose from the hospital.  Mr. Purdy joined the ranks of what the police call reclassified homicide victims, injured in one year but not added to the departments murder tally until at least the next. They include people stabbed or shot decades ago who hang on until old age, as well as young paraplegics felled by bedsores that lead to amputations and infections. They are linked only by the creeping pace of deaths arrival, and the stalled investigations that can follow. Of the seven reclassified homicides logged by the police so far this year, five remain unsolved, a Police Department spokesman said, a reflection of how cases become harder to close as time goes on. There were 16 over all last year. Of course a delay presents another challenge, but its not the only challenge, said Dermot F. Shea, the departments deputy commissioner in charge of crime analysis, stressing that detectives are trying just as hard to uncover clues while a victim is alive. In Mr. Purdys case, the crime scene unit that handles homicide scenes did not respond, leaving the work to an evidence collection team that conducts less rigorous ballistics tests and takes less detailed measurements. There was scant progress in the case between his death in December and the medical examiners homicide ruling in March. Only in recent weeks have detectives begun gathering better leads. No matter how quickly a victims relatives or law enforcement officials want an answer on the cause of death, the citys 30 medical examiners are bound to trace a corpses clues to the start of the chain. The No. 1 thing in every case is the body itself, said the chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson. And the body never lies.  Mr. Purdys autopsy was completed the day he died, and an examiner would have found the fatal blood clots in his lungs immediately. But the delay in ruling the case a homicide appears to have stemmed from toxicology tests, which can reveal contributing causes and take weeks or months to be completed. When Mr. Purdy arrived at the emergency room he said he felt short of breath after smoking marijuana, initially leading doctors to believe he might have died of   complications. They told his mother it looked as if he had taken K2, a drug whose popularity at the time was creating a panic, though Mr. Purdy told his mother he had not. Soon after, the medical examiners office cautioned Sergeant LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, that drugs like K2 could have raised Mr. Purdys body temperature and caused the release of the blood clots. But his death certificate ultimately linked them to the gunshot wound and resulting paralysis, not to any drugs. The blood clots pooled in his legs, migrated toward his heart and threw off fatal clots to both lobes of his lungs. Back at his sisters apartment, Mr. Purdys nieces and nephews jumped into his thick, tattooed arms, competing for attention. They asked why he was in a wheelchair. And he said, Because I done something really stupid, his mother, Ms. Johnson, recalled. He kept to himself what he meant. He took trips outside in his wheelchair for a smoke or fresh air. He fitfully discovered life outside the hospital as a paraplegic. He dwelled on the numbness in his penis, expressing anxiety about never again being able to have sex or children. Im never going to feel this again? he would say, Ms. Johnson recalled. It was funny to me, but he was really serious.  As a salve for his fears, his aunt tickled him below the waist. And he felt that, Ms. Johnson said. At the end of each day his younger brother Randy Parker, an Army veteran of Kuwait and Afghanistan, scrubbed him down in the bath. Mr. Purdy often hugged him and told him he loved him, and grieved his wilting body. Mr. Parker recalled him saying, I never thought that I would see the day that my baby brother would have to pick me up and do this, you know, wipe my ass and change my Pampers and stuff like that.  He would sit there and he would cry, Mr. Parker added. On the night of Dec. 13, Ms. Parker ordered a pizza. Mr. Purdy and some siblings were playing cards at a table in a cramped kitchen of her   apartment. He gasped for air. At first Im thinking its a joke, Ms. Parker said. He said he was tired.  Mr. Purdy had been sleeping on a couch in the living room, and Mr. Parker wheeled him there to rest. It was the first time he had lost his breath since coming home. Next thing you know, hes like, I cant breathe, I cant breathe, Ms. Parker said. An ambulance rushed him to Lincoln Medical Center, where emergency medical workers took him in just as his mother arrived. His heart was racing, its rate in the 130s. He had high blood pressure. Nurses tried pulling his clothes off, but it hurt his back. So I was like, O. K. I got this, let me do this, his mother said. Her son threw up his arms, and she pulled off his shirt. Seconds later his eyes rolled back and his body started shaking. Nurses tried to tie him to the gurney to draw blood, but he went unconscious. He began having    activity where he would gesticulate and make grunting noises, medical notes say. Doctors pulled him away. He was put on a ventilator at 12:43 a. m. A   later, he had no pulse. For 26 minutes, doctors tried to resuscitate him. At 1:41 a. m. on Dec. 14, he was pronounced dead by Dr. Allysia Guy. They wrote in medical records that his death appeared connected to an unknown drug, though they acknowledged not understanding the true cause. The next day at 10 a. m. Mr. Purdy had been scheduled to have his first doctors appointment since his discharge from Lincoln. It was the day before what would have been his 30th birthday. One of the last things doctors had told him was how important that appointment was."
Grandmothers Killing Lays Bare a Dilemma in Child Welfare Work - The New York Times,New York Times,"James C. McKinley Jr., Al Baker and Ashley Southall",6/19/2017,"The girl named Heaven lay curled up asleep next to her grandmother on the mattress they shared on the living room floor. The woman, Carmen Irizarry, had been the   s legal guardian for years, a   for the girls troubled mother. Now, Heavens protector was sick, breathing from an oxygen tank after a long hospital stay for acute lung disease. It was early in the morning of May 11, quiet in the   in the   apartment in the South Bronx. Just before 5 a. m. Henry Maldonado, Ms. Irizarrys companion of 30 years, entered the room clutching a chefs knife, the police said. In a fury, he thrust the knife at Heaven, then at Ms. Irizarry, back and forth, the blade cutting five times into Heavens torso and left leg. Her grandmother tried to block the blows. Heaven, she said, go! Those were Ms. Irizarrys last words to her granddaughter, the girl told the police, and they very likely saved her from joining the grim tally of children killed by the people closest to them. In a city that has seen murder rates fall to historic lows, such deaths remain a stubborn strain of violence, one that too often has also exposed lapses in the child welfare system. In the most notorious of those cases, caseworkers missed persistent signs of physical abuse and children later died, inciting outrage and prompting reforms. The signs in Heaven Irizarrys case were subtler in that her home was typical of many troubled households that child welfare workers encounter. She was loved, and had a solid guardian, but she was also surrounded by people addicted to drugs and entangled in the criminal justice system. Determining whether she was in danger was not a simple task. Two days after Heaven was born, her mother, Brenda Irizarry, handed the newborn over to her own mother. She had little choice: She was bound for prison on a parole violation, and child welfare officials were inquiring about the baby. That day in August 2006 was the first of three encounters New York Citys child welfare agency would have with the family. Each time, caseworkers either missed or discounted Mr. Maldonados history of domestic violence and drug abuse. Had she not escaped, Heaven might well have been the victim of the eighth murder recorded this year in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times is reporting on every killing logged in 2016. Instead, it was her    grandmother whose name was recorded that morning. Since then, the precinct has endured several more homicides, and it now has 14 for the year, more than all but one other precinct in the city. As her grandmother crumbled under the knife strikes, Heaven ran barefoot out the door, blood soaking her pink nightie. Up two flights of steps, she went to an apartment directly above her grandmothers at 700 East 156th Street in the St. Marys Park Houses. Loretta Fleming opened the door and Heaven stumbled in, hysterical. My grandfather went crazy, the girl said. Ms. Fleming, who often babysat for Heaven, called 911. Below, she could hear Mr. Maldonado knocking things over, breaking glass. You are going to die, she heard him scream. Then she smelled smoke. Mr. Maldonado, 55, was putting a lighter to papers and clothes, the police said. He had plunged the   knife into Ms. Irizarry more than two dozen times, breaking off the haft. Then he stabbed himself twice in the chest with a steak knife. Firefighters broke down the door and doused the flames. Officers used a stun gun to subdue Mr. Maldonado. When Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, interviewed Mr. Maldonado eight days later in the burn unit at Jacobi Medical Center, he said all that he could remember was that he had tried to kill himself. Told that Ms. Irizarry had been hurt, Mr. Maldonado said he wanted a lawyer. Then he asked if Heaven was all right. I said, Shes fine, but you stabbed her five times, Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. So he goes, What about my wife? I just shook my head. He goes, What does that mean? I said, She died and you killed her.  In hindsight, there were clues that despite Ms. Irizarrys evident devotion to Heaven, the girl lived amid perilous instability, exposed to her mothers   lifestyle and Mr. Maldonados violent mood swings. This defendant has a history of violence against the deceased, a Bronx assistant district attorney, Felicity Lung, said at a court hearing in June after Mr. Maldonado was charged with murder in Ms. Irizarrys death. A year before Heaven was born, Mr. Maldonado attacked Ms. Irizarry on two consecutive days, once with his fists and once with a machete. He barred the door and cut the phone line during the second rampage, according to court records and interviews with witnesses. He was arrested and pleaded guilty to assault. Two years later, in October 2007, child welfare workers determined that Ms. Irizarrys home was safe for her granddaughter when they conducted a   home study, after Ms. Irizarry had filed a petition for custody of Heaven. At the time, the agency could not readily examine criminal records. The court, relying on the caseworkers report, appointed Ms. Irizarry the childs legal guardian. Heavens father, who could not be located for comment, has not played a role in her life and never sought custody, several relatives said. Eight years later, the agency again investigated the family after Brenda Irizarry, Heavens mother, who lived in the apartment for long periods, assaulted a woman with a baseball bat as Heaven looked on. Ms. Irizarry pleaded guilty in September 2015 to   attempted assault, but was not sentenced to serve any time. Again, caseworkers determined that Carmen Irizarry was a competent guardian, even though she sometimes left the child with her daughter, two people familiar with the case said. That time, the caseworkers raised questions with teachers at Public School 157. Why had Heaven missed more than 10 days of school in the second grade? Her attendance worsened the next year, when she missed 26 as her grandmothers health failed yet her teachers had never alerted child welfare officials, the people familiar with the case said. The citys Education Department, citing privacy laws, declined to comment on why Heavens absences had not prompted a call to the authorities. Friends said Susie Irizarry     as the grandmother was known to them     was a vigilant guardian who doted on Heaven, and city officials confirm that there was never a complaint that Heaven was physically abused. In practice, Ms. Irizarry was not the only one watching Heaven. She worked long hours as a counselor for disabled adults and came home late most nights, neighbors and relatives said. It was Mr. Maldonado, or Heavens mother, who often cared for the girl after school. And a couple of afternoons a week, Heaven would stay with Ms. Fleming, the neighbor to whom she would flee the night her grandmother was killed. Brenda Irizarry, 44, has been arrested nine times since 2013, on charges including prostitution, petty larceny and drug possession. Henry Maldonado has at least 15 arrests dating back to 1984, on assorted charges, including carrying a knife, drug possession and armed robbery. In 2010, he pleaded guilty to selling pills he had obtained with Medicaid benefits to a black market drug dealer. In addition, a man who lived with Ms. Fleming, and who occasionally accompanied Heaven and Brenda Irizarry on outings to the park or the beach, was a sex offender who had served 21 years in connection with the rape and robbery of a    girl, law enforcement officials said. A year ago, the man, Morgan Shuler, 53, whose nickname was Moet, was arrested again, on charges that he had raped a woman in Heavens building. He pleaded not guilty. Moet loved Heaven, Ms. Fleming said. Since the murder, Heaven has been placed in the temporary custody of Mr. Maldonados estranged son, Henry Jr. who is seeking permanent custody, relatives said. The girls physical wounds have healed, and she is thriving in a new home and school in the North Bronx, law enforcement officials said. She attended a dance and gymnastics camp over the summer. The family took her   rafting in Pennsylvania and on a Florida vacation. For the first time in her life, Heaven has her own bed. Henry Maldonado pleaded not guilty at his court arraignment in June. His lawyer, Martin Goldberg, has not yet indicated whether he intends to offer a psychiatric defense. Gladys Carrin, the commissioner of the citys Administration for Childrens Services, said state law precluded her from saying whether caseworkers had been aware of Mr. Maldonados previous attack on Ms. Irizarry or knew of the criminal backgrounds of other people in Heavens orbit. The agency does not ask the courts to put children in foster care solely because there are drug addicts or people with criminal records in a home, Ms. Carrin said. Indeed, many families the agency monitors in the South Bronx struggle with a combination of those problems. Wed be removing many, many more children, she said. Ms. Carrin said it was difficult for caseworkers to know about every person caring for a child. Investigations focus on the primary caregiver, in this case Carmen Irizarry, she said. The agency turns to foster care only as a last resort, usually in cases of physical abuse, molestation or extreme neglect, the commissioner said. Our work is not an exact science, she said. There is no way to be able to predict 100 percent of the time what could happen, and when something could happen, and when is the right time to intervene.  It is impossible to separate Mr. Maldonado from his daily landscape of methadone clinics, pill mills,   drug purchases and furtive highs in parks, alleys and stairwells. He was well known on the commercial strip of 149th Street near Third Avenue, with his long, graying hair pulled back in a ponytail, his Death Before Dishonor patch, the heavy rings on every finger, a cane in one hand, a knife in his pocket. Outlaw forever, forever outlaw was how he described himself on Facebook. Heroin and opioid abuse have swept into suburban and rural areas of the country, but the scourge has long devastated the South Bronx, where Mr. Maldonado and Ms. Irizarry lived. More people die of heroin and opioid overdoses in the Bronx than anywhere else in the city the rate exceeds 22 per 100, 000 residents. Few areas have as many methadone clinics as the Mott Haven and Melrose neighborhoods in the 40th Precinct. Mr. Maldonado had been an addict for decades, and he went daily to a methadone clinic on East 138th Street. Methadone treatment is intended to curb the craving for heroin, but the clinics also tend to be gathering spots for less resolute addicts who often lead one another to backslide, addiction experts said. After taking his dose, Mr. Maldonado would typically spend days stalking his next high: pills, PCP, cocaine and, once in a while, heroin, relatives and fellow addicts said. He had a very bad drug problem, his daughter, Evita Maldonado, said. He would take whatever he can get his hands on.  His heavy drug use had started in the early 1980s, around the time he met Ms. Irizarry in a salsa club near Bristow and Jennings Streets. Her name in those days was Carmen Rodriguez. She had been briefly married in the 1970s to Brendas father, Harry Irizarry, and kept his surname. Ms. Irizarry loved to dance, many of her friends recalled. Mr. Maldonado, who then went by the nickname Dee Jay, ran with young men who called themselves the Cool Brothers and provided security for clubs. Their relationship was tempestuous and revolved around drinking, drugs and nightclubs, friends said. Henry was kind of a wild man, said Jimmy Soriano, a friend from those days. They used to get high like there was a shortage of drugs or something.  Mr. Maldonado had a melodramatic streak and was quick to take offense, friends said. During one argument with Ms. Irizarry, while he was high on PCP, he lay in the street and asked someone to drive a car over him. Ms. Irizarry, too, fought addictions, to alcohol and crack cocaine. While she eventually won the struggle in the early 1990s, after the birth of her two younger daughters, Mr. Maldonado fell back into drug use again and again, storming out of   meetings. He was like a stick of dynamite, said Claude Hernandez, one of his counselors. In the early 1990s, Mr. Maldonado tried to jump off a roof and was hospitalized at Harlem Hospital, his lawyer, Mr. Goldberg, said. Another time, he tried to hang himself at St. Barnabas Hospital while undergoing detoxification. He never found the strength to quit, fellow addicts say. And when he was high, neighbors said, he often fought with Ms. Irizarry. They were always arguing, said Joy T. Madison, who lived below the couple for 15 years. He was always drinking and drugging. Then hed come home and pick a fight with her.  The criminal justice system did little to help. Most of his offenses were reduced to misdemeanors, and Mr. Maldonado spent no time in state prison and only a few days in jail. Judges sometimes sentenced him to anger counseling or community service, but he was never compelled to enter drug treatment as part of a plea deal, court records show. In addition to using illegal drugs, he spent many days visiting doctors at three clinics. A psychiatrist at one prescribed him   and tranquilizers for bipolar disorder, said Mr. Goldberg, his lawyer. He was also seeing an anesthesiologist for back and knee pain. The treatment for those, Mr. Goldberg said, was more drugs: opioid pills and injections. Still, several of Mr. Maldonados friends said they could never have predicted that he would attack Ms. Irizarry and Heaven. He was often seen hugging and kissing Ms. Irizarry. He also seemed to revel in his role as grandfather, doting on Heaven and walking her to school. To do what he did, he must have been in another world, a close friend and fellow addict, Carlos Nuez, said. I still, to this day, cannot see it happening.  Yet several friends said there were clear signs that Mr. Maldonado was falling apart in April, amid Ms. Irizarrys illness. After a lifetime of smoking, she collapsed last November with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Five months later, she stopped breathing for a time and spent weeks at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center. While she lay in intensive care, Mr. Maldonado stepped up his use of illicit drugs and stopped taking   medication, friends and relatives said. He was smoking PCP and spoke of suicide. He was bugging out, Mr. Nuez recalled. His grief proved violent. A neighbor who tried to visit Heavens mother, Brenda, in April said Mr. Maldonado punched him and chased him away with a sword. The same month, Mr. Maldonado attacked his daughter Evita with a cane after she confronted him about his drug use, she said in an interview. He also complained bitterly about Brendas presence in the apartment, blaming her for Ms. Irizarrys condition and threatening to kill her, friends said. In late April Ms. Irizarry left the hospital, weak and unable to work. She asked Brenda to move out. She said that things were going to change, one of her closest friends, Nilsa Rivera, said. She was not going to deal with anyones negativity or addictions.  Mr. Maldonado, who did odd jobs for cash and recently started receiving disability benefits, had to divert more of his income toward their bills. Heaven, in a   conversation with Detective Javier Cordero, said Mr. Maldonado screamed, No more bills, as he attacked her and her grandmother. The night before that attack, a neighbor said, he was agitated and   in the hall outside Ms. Irizarrys apartment. You could see the stress on his face, the neighbor, Steven Ocasio, said. He said, My demons is out tonight.  Mr. Goldberg, the defense lawyer, said Mr. Maldonado denied that he smoked PCP that evening. But he said that in the   hours, Mr. Maldonado had taken prescription drugs, among them Seroquel, Xanax, Ambien and OxyContin. This was a suicide attempt, Mr. Goldberg said. In the end, however, it was not Mr. Maldonado who died, but Ms. Irizarry. In a sense, she was a victim of her faith in him, the couples youngest daughter, Angelica Rosado, said. She never gave up on him."
BBC Targets Kids with Fake Islam Means Peace Claim Following Finsbury Park Attack,Breitbart,Raheem Kassam,6/19/2017,"The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) has published a story entitled What is Islamophobia? containing misleading information such as the common trope that Islam means peace. [Published just hours after the terrorist attack outside Finsbury Park mosque, the BBCs article is hosted on their CBBC (Childrens BBC) website. It begins: Following recent events in the news you might have been hearing a lot about Islam and maybe the term Islamophobia     but what does this mean?  It states: Islam is over 1, 400 years old, dating back to the 7th Century. The Islamic word for God is Allah. The word Islam comes from an old Arabic word meaning peace.  UPDATE 21 June 2017: Following the publication of this article, the BBC has changed its copy to state: Islam is over 1, 400 years old, dating back to the 7th Century. The Islamic word for God is Allah. The word Islam means submission to Gods will and obedience to Gods law. It comes from an old Arabic word meaning peace.  In reality, the word Islam actually means submission implying submission to Allah. There has been a broader discussion on the matter in recent years, but while Salam means welcome or peace, the root of the word Islam is grounded in the idea of submission to Allah. This has been confirmed by a number of Quranic scholars, as well as Muslims on the Ummah Forum website. One writes: i would sum it up as, islam means submission, one who submits is a muslim, and submission to Allah will bring peace to your heart insha Allah.  Even Britains most notorious Islamist preacher Anjem Choudary concurred, in an interview with CBN: You cant say that Islam is a religion of peace, Choudary told CBN News. Because Islam does not mean peace. Islam means submission. So the Muslim is one who submits. There is a place for violence in Islam. There is a place for jihad in Islam.  CBBC adds, with no evidence:       many people say those terrorist groups have extreme beliefs of hatred and violence that have little to do with what most Muslims believe.  In reality, vast numbers of Muslims, even in the Western world, hold   views and ideals that fit well with the modus operandi of terrorist groups. While indeed there is some   discrimination all around the world,   and Muslim Brotherhood affiliated groups created and seized upon the word Islamophobia in order to promote the ideas of fitna and fasad: effectively the idea of standing in the way of the spread of Islam. Quran 2:191 commands: And kill [the unbelievers] wherever you find them, and drive them out from whence they drove you out, and persecution is severer than slaughter, and do not fight with them at the Sacred Mosque until they fight with you in it, but if they do fight you, then slay them such is the recompense of the unbelievers.  Quran 5:32 says: Indeed, the penalty for those who wage war against Allah and His Messenger and strive upon earth [to cause] corruption is none but that they be killed or crucified or that their hands and feet be cut off from opposite sides or that they be exiled from the land. That is for them a disgrace in this world and for them in the Hereafter is a great punishment.  Following the London Bridge terrorist attack, CBBC wrote: A white van hit pedestrians on London Bridge at about 10pm on Saturday, then three men got out and attacked people in nearby Borough Market. Police arrived within a few minutes and the three men believed to be responsible for the attack were killed by the specially trained police. Dozens of emergency service workers were sent to the scene and the injured were taken to five London hospitals to be treated. Police investigations into what happened are continuing. A group called Islamic State has said it was behind the attack, but police havent confirmed if that is true. Under an article entitled What is the Islamic State? the BBCs childrens website says: IS are a group based in the Middle East, mainly in Iraq and Syria, who have extreme religious beliefs. They use brutal violence against anyone who doesnt agree with their views. They claim to follow the religion of Islam, but many people say their beliefs of hatred and violence have little to do with what the majority of Muslims believe."
Brazil Suspends Sales of Tear Gas to Venezuela amid Increasing Police Violence - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/19/2017,"The Brazilian government has suspended sales of tear gas to Venezuela amid increasing police violence, Reuters has reported. [In a move that will further isolate Venezuelas socialist dictator Nicols Maduro, Brazils Defense Ministry and Ministry of Foreign Relations reached the decision to halt sales after appeals from the countrys opposition.  On Friday, the Brazilian Defense Ministry confirmed it had canceled a shipment of gas canisters in April intended for the Venezuelan military, produced by the   weaponry company Condor Tecnologias   although it did not provide a reason for the decision. Condor has since confirmed it still has two ongoing contracts with the Venezuelan military but would not discuss their status. The company, which has previously received criticism for arming the militaries of Turkey and Bahrain, claimed that it did not consider the political leanings of their customers and warned that blocking their exports could have dramatic consequences, since there may be no alternative for security forces other than using firearms.  However, sources close to the decision told Reuters that the (Brazilian) government decided to accept the oppositions request because theres a massacre in Venezuela, while another government official said that the exporting of any other crowd control equipment would also be suspended. (Brazil) did absolutely the correct thing in denying permission for the shipment, said opposition leader Henrique Capriles, who still serves as the governor of Miranda. Were working on the others, the only (holdout) seems to be China.  Meanwhile, opposition politician Jorge Milln also celebrated the decision, confirming that leaders had made multiple requests to stop Brazil providing tools for repression.  We discovered that there were advanced negotiations for the purchase of material in Brazil and made a specific complaint, Milln told O Globo. The decision comes amidst increasing police and military violence across Venezuela, as   protesters ratchet up the size and scale of their demonstrations calling for an election and as Maduro seeks to tighten his grip on power by rewriting the countries constitution. On Monday, Latin American leaders met for a summit in Cancun, Mexico, to discuss the escalating crisis, although they have yet to reach a consensus on the next steps to take. So far, an estimated 90 protesters have been killed since daily protests began in late March, as police use water cannons, rubber bullets, and smoke bombs to contain protesters. Images from inside the country have shown increasing police brutality. Last week, a    boy was run over and tortured by an armored vehicle driven by the Venezuelan National Guard in the city of Mrida. An audio recording obtained by the Miami Herald revealed a military general suggesting that police should start using sniper rifles to contain the protests. As many as eight Latin American countries have now signed a letter condemning an excessive use of force by Venezuelan authorities against civilians who are protesting government measures that affect democratic stability and cause the loss of human life.

Finsbury Park Attack Suspect Named as Cardiff Resident Darren Osborne,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/19/2017,"The alleged driver of the van that killed one and injured ten people outside of a Finsbury mosque Sunday evening has been identified as    father of four Cardiff resident Darren Osborne. [Mr Osborne is said to have been positively identified as the man arrested last night by police by a former schoolmate who attended Broadoak Mathematics and Computing College with Osborne. The unidentified man said that he had known Osborne for over 35 years and was sure that the man arrested was the    father of four, the Daily Mail reports.  Ive known him for 35 years, I grew up with him. Its 100% him. He lives in Wales, he has four kids and his partner, the man said. Earlier today police raided a residence in Cardiff, now thought to be that of Mr Osborne. Neighbours of the    say they are shocked regarding the allegations.    neighbour Pauline Tibbs said, The police have been back and forth here all day. Its a terrible shock, and added, Ive seen him walking in the street but never spoken to him. He seemed normal enough. He has lived here a couple of years and kept himself to himself.  Osborne is said to have grown up in    Somerset but later moved to Wales. He is also said to have separated from his spouse around six months ago. The van used in the attack is allegedly said to have been rented from Pontyclun Van Hire for    which is around 15 miles away from where Osborne lives. The company owners have expressed shock and sadness regarding the attack and called it cowardly.  Earlier Monday morning Osborne was arrested on terrorism and attempted murder charges. Witnesses say that after the attack he shouted, Im going to kill all Muslims     I did my bit.  The UK domestic security service Mi5 have said that Osborne has never previously been on their radar, and has no known police record. Labour MP Jo Stevens, whose constituency Osborne resides in, commented on the case telling people with information to report it directly to police. She then added, I am also appealing to everyone who uses social media, to please be aware that prejudicial tweets about the alleged attacker may constitute contempt of court, and could even lead to any prosecution or trial having to be abandoned."
"Kidnapped Border Patrol Agent Was Hacked with Machete, Suspects Caught",Breitbart,Brandon Darby &amp Ildefonso Ortiz,6/19/2017,"Suspects in the kidnapping and attack of a U. S. Border Patrol agent have been captured and an official statement from authorities reveals that the agent was hacked with a machete. Breitbart Texas first reported on the issue and first reported the identity of one of the suspects. In this case, Customs and Border Protection (CBP) first tried to keep the matter from the public and then downplayed aspects of the attack. [The first report on the June 9, 2017, kidnapping and attack, Border Patrol Agent Found injured on Side of Roadway after Attack, revealed that the issue had occurred and that CBP had not prioritized alerting the public or other Border Patrol agents.  The second report, Border Patrol Agent was Kidnapped, FBI Leads Investigation, relied on Breitbart Texas sources who had provided the actual BOLO (Be On Lookout) that was sent to law enforcement officers and agents on the matter. The third report, FBIs Suspect in Kidnapping of Border Agent is   Deported 3 Times Prior, revealed all of the details of the BOLO, named the suspect, and source claims that the listed suspect had been deported three times prior to the attack. The recently released official statement directly confirms most of the information Breitbart sources provided. Other aspects, such as the immigration status of one of the suspects, is left unconfirmed by authorities though implied in the fact that one of the suspects residences is mentioned and the alleged illegal immigrants place of residence is omitted. The official statement from the Doa Ana County Sheriffs Department is provided in full below: TWO MEN SUSPECTED IN ATTACK OF   AGENT IN CUSTODY,             Two men accused in the brutal attack of an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on June 9 are in custody.             On Tuesday, FBI agents in the El Paso Sector, with the assistance of Doa Ana County Sheriffs detectives, arrested    Sergio Ivan   on an outstanding warrant of aggravated battery (great bodily harm) and aggravated assault. He is currently in custody at the El Paso County Detention Center awaiting extradition to Doa Ana County. Thursday,    Fernando Puga of Las Cruces was taken into custody by Doa Ana County Sheriffs detectives with the assistance of FBI agents. Puga is charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, and attempted murder.  He is currently being held at the Doa Ana County Detention Center on a $1 million cash bond.             According to court documents filed by sheriffs detectives,   and Puga confronted an   U. S. Border Patrol agent on Friday, June 9, as the agent was reportedly helping his mother at her tamale stand near the intersection of Stan Roberts and McCombs in northeast El Paso.             The agent reportedly left in his vehicle with   and Puga.             At approximately 11:40 p. m. that same night, a sheriffs deputy was dispatched to Paradise Lane, just off Shalem Colony Trail west of Las Cruces. Upon his arrival, the deputy reported finding a    male subject who appeared to be suffering from multiple lacerations to his head and arms.             The male subject was later identified as the   agent who reportedly left with   and Puga from northeast El Paso. The victim said the two men were armed with a gun and a machete. Detectives say the victim was struck repeatedly with the machete.             The gun was later discovered to be a pellet gun.             Sheriffs detectives began to piece together details of the attack with an earlier call for service, one that happened just before 9 p. m. on the same night in the 100 block of Amparo Road in Chaparral.     Deputies responded to that location on what was initially believed to be an unrelated domestic dispute. When they arrived, it was learned that   had been at the house, demanding to see his  . The womans sister told deputies   threatened her with what appeared to be a handgun. The sister described the vehicle   was in as an   red Nissan     the same vehicle that sheriffs deputies located on the side of McCombs Road, just south of the New   state line. The vehicle matched the description provided by the victim on Amparo Road. Physical descriptions of the two suspects also matched between the victim on Amparo Road, the agent and his mother. The victim remains in critical condition at UMC. The incident is still an open investigation, in cooperation with the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, the U. S. Attorneys Office for the Western District of Texas, and the Third Judicial District Attorneys Office. Brandon Darby is managing director and    of Breitbart Texas.

Social Circles Collide on a Dance Floor. Then a Brawl Ends in Death. - The New York Times,New York Times,"Benjamin Mueller, Ashley Southall and Al Baker",6/19/2017,"Someone cut the music, and then from the kitchen came the crash of a utensil drawer being yanked out of a wooden cabinet. Vernon Hubbard stepped over tiles strewed with spatulas, spoons, purple plates and an unopened liter of soda. His eyelids were droopy, witnesses said, and in each hand he carried a steak knife. Nobodys getting out of here alive, he said from the apartment doorway, according to a witness. Others remembered a more lurid phrase: People, he warned, would be leaving out in body bags.  Some partygoers sat   wedged together on a few living room couches. Others untangled themselves from a brawl that had grown out of a dance in the middle of the room. A woman shouted, All I want to do is go home.  In a     polyester shirt and Nikes, with brandy and beer blurring his thinking, Mr. Hubbard seemed barely able to stand, let alone hold anyone hostage. Around 30 people were marooned inside Apartment 15E at 645 Westchester Avenue, a public housing   around East 152nd Street in the South Bronx. Only one elevator was working. Some neighbors, to blunt the weekend noise, had taken sleeping pills and wedged mats in their entryways. A few people grabbed at Mr. Hubbards arms, trying to get him to drop the knives. Others hid in a back bedroom. One woman called the police. Everybody screamed. Mr. Hubbard started swinging, witnesses and the police said     flailing, really. His arms were locked at the elbow, and his body tipped as he sliced the air. People saw knives flash inside a knot of bodies. Moments later, Julian Washington, a    man in a fitted Yankees hat, staggered into the buildings hallway, bleeding. He had pushed his best friend, Tawana Vargas, out the door as the fight heated up, and she had been pacing the hallway waiting for him. Now, she pulled his left hand away from his head, figuring     hoping     that he had been smashed with a beer bottle, nothing worse. Blood spurted out of his neck, a few inches below his left ear, and it ran in rivulets down the beige bricks of the hallway wall. Mr. Washington choked on a few words, and then collapsed. Partygoers rushed out behind him, leaving bloody footprints on the floor. Ms. Vargas ran downstairs to look for a police officer. Balloons in purple, gold and black lost their helium and floated to the apartments linoleum tile floor. Napkins, ribbons and plastic cups were cracked and torn. They were all in purple, to celebrate the first year the partys host, Darshonna Willoughby, who is Mr. Hubbards cousin, had survived with lupus. Mr. Hubbard waited at the elevator bank. His leather jacket, investigators said, was covered in blood, on its collar and elbows and pockets. The one working elevator arrived. He showed little of the panic of someone who had just stabbed a man, the police said. At the foot of the   part of the St. Marys Park Houses, he tossed a knife into the parking lot, witnesses said, waved his arm in vain for a cab and then lumbered toward the subway. Witnesses said the crime was so senseless and the getaway so inept that they had been moved, against their instincts, to point him out to police officers, who stopped him near the subway. On the 15th floor, one person crouched by Mr. Washingtons side: Mr. Hubbards sister, Cassandra Newbold, who had been fighting with Mr. Washington, too. She used his clothes to try to stop the bleeding. I was trying to plug and patch and scream for help, she said. Everybody else that was at that party decided to flee the scene.  That image of a stampede of partygoers racing past Mr. Washingtons   body haunts his brother, Guy Miller. For everybody just to walk over him, to leave him in the hallway by himself, thats the crushing part, Mr. Miller said. It seemed like he just died by himself, suffering, with nobody there.  Mr. Washington was pronounced dead at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center almost an hour later, at 12:53 a. m. on April 10. He became the sixth of 10 homicides logged this year in the 40th Precinct in the South Bronx, making it the second deadliest in New York City, behind the 75th Precinct in East New York, Brooklyn. Some accounts of that night are almost unrecognizable, comparing one with the next. The stories, blurred by heavy drinking, have refracted through friendships and family ties, and through a kaleidoscope of vantage points. The night started more simply. Mr. Washington lived in the apartment in East Harlem where his grandmother had raised him, but the hillside towers of the St. Marys Park Houses were his second home. It was there, in Ms. Vargass apartment on the ninth floor, that he would play Call of Duty and Grand Theft Auto, smoke cigarettes and debate voting for Bernie Sanders. He and Ms. Vargas had met in high school and dated before she came out as gay and he as bisexual. He was witty and   with a natural talent for dance, and he made fast friends around the housing project, where people called him Peaches. On April 9, a Saturday, he walked there over the Harlem River, his long legs carrying him almost as quickly as the subway could. On the stove in his apartment, Mr. Washington had left half a pot of seafood gumbo, a favorite dish among his friends that he hoped to perfect in culinary school someday soon. He met Ms. Vargas in her sisters apartment in the same complex, where Mr. Washington sometimes stayed the night on a tattered couch beneath the windows. Mr. Washington was unemployed, but his friends were unwinding from long weeks at work. They passed around big bottles of Corona, the communion cup of their gatherings. From there, they bounced around an archipelago of public housing apartments, corner spots and hallways where they could hang out free of charge and unbothered, for the most part, by the police. Mr. Washington drank beer, got some food and talked up a recent WWE wrestling event with a younger friend. At each spot, they picked up a few more people. Ms. Vargas said she recently warned Mr. Washington about the danger lurking in her corner of the vast public housing landscape in the South Bronx. Dont hang out in this building, she said she told him. This area is just bad, period. Just stay in Harlem where you live.  But, she added, Julian was just that type of person always looking for something.  Mr. Washington used to party in the West Village and at the nearby piers with a ragtag group of gay people, many of them black and Hispanic. But as gentrification marched toward the water, his circle lost that spot on the margins of the city, where they could let loose among strangers they trusted. Mr. Washington started spending more time in Bronx parks and housing projects. Shortly after 11 p. m. Mr. Washington got curious about the party for Ms. Willoughby on the 15th floor. They had not been invited, and none of them were dressed in purple, the color of lupus awareness, as an invitation had asked, so Mr. Washington walked down a flight of stairs to ask if they could join. So then he came back, he was like, Yes, its lit, she said we can come down, Ms. Vargas said. For much of the night, the party had been relaxed. Mr. Hubbard had arrived around 6 p. m. People were sitting and talking on couches around the living room. Reggae and   hits were playing over the speakers, among them Rihannas single Work, Mr. Washingtons favorite song of the moment. It had something of the feeling of a family reunion. Ms. Willoughby had invited a number of her cousins, among them Mr. Hubbard, with whom she had reconnected only a few months earlier through her grandfather. He had come halfheartedly, his mother said in an interview. His sister, Ms. Newbold, asked him to bring food she had cooked: pans of pork shoulder, fried chicken, collard greens, crab salad and macaroni and cheese. Ms. Willoughby, wearing all black, cut the cake, which had two photos: one when she was in the hospital being treated for lupus, and another from when she had started feeling better. Mr. Hubbard, 35, looked out of place. A   chef who had entered foster care when he was 12, he had been spending much of his time at home since being stabbed in the spine with an ice pick last summer during a robbery or possible gang assault, his mother, Venice Quinones, said. He was overheard complaining to his sister about wanting to go home until she persuaded him to stay. And he was getting drunk. He said in a jailhouse interview that he was downing EJ brandy and Miller beer. He just looked crazy in his eyes     he looked crazy to me, said Natasha Hill, a partygoer. They were red, and he looked like he had evil in his eyes.  The staid mood swung when Mr. Washington and his friends entered. They started dancing right away, despite the quizzical looks they were getting from the other partygoers, whom they did not know. The living room, 11 feet by 17 feet, swelled with people, some spilling into the hallway. I think they were kind of taken aback by the fact that we were so hype, Ms. Vargas recalled. She and Mr. Washington went into the sliver of a kitchen to pour themselves Georgi vodka. Ms. Newbold, in Army fatigue pants, seemed to take offense. She was like, Who yall with? or something along those lines, Ms. Vargas said. Mr. Washington, gently needling his interrogator, answered, Boo Boo Kitty, we good, using the nickname for a character on the nighttime soap opera Empire.  The music turned from radio hits to more aggressive dance beats. People started dancing so hard that one attendee jokingly said to a friend that she thought someones head was going to fall off. A circle formed, and a friend of Mr. Washingtons, Raldy Sanchez, started dancing near Ms. Newbold. The throbbing music seemed, from the start, like a volatile addition to the blend of alcohol and suspicion. Out of the tangle of bodies, no two people emerged with the same memory of what went wrong. In Mr. Sanchezs telling, he was dancing in a tight space, with Ms. Newbold and others pressing up against him, when out of nowhere, Mr. Hubbard yanked on a beaded necklace he was wearing. Mr. Sanchez said he threw a punch and shoved Mr. Hubbard to try to get him to back off, before three or four people jumped on him and started pummeling him. Mr. Washington and Ms. Vargas were in the kitchen, and they came running when they heard the commotion. They both threw punches, too. Mr. Washington, his friends said, tried to break up the fight and pushed his friends out of the apartment. Though Mr. Hubbards swings hit Mr. Washington, the only person who was hurt, the police believe Mr. Sanchez had been his target. They were aiming for him, and his friend jumped in, said Detective Jesus Rodriguez of the 40th Precinct detective squad. Julian jumped in and saved him. Julian took the brunt of it.  Mr. Hubbard, who has pleaded not guilty to   murder and other charges, said in the interview that the fight gave him flashbacks to when he was stabbed last summer. But he denied killing Mr. Washington and said an explanation for the blood on his jacket would wait until September, when he is due back in court. The authorities, after wading through the various stories, said they gave credence to the view that Ms. Newbold and Mr. Hubbard were the ones who had escalated the fight. But Ms. Newbold said the brawl had started when she was dancing with her back to Mr. Sanchez and, out of nowhere, felt a push and landed face down on a couch. All of a sudden, Ms. Newbold said, several people were raining punches on her. She also said she heard a man yell, Go get the heat, referring to a gun. The police piled as many witnesses as they could into patrol cars and vans to take down their stories at the station house on Alexander Avenue. Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the detective squad, said the witnesses were separated so differences in their stories could not be smoothed over. Everyones in a different corner, Sergeant LoPuzzo said. Others came forward in the days after     a rarity in the South Bronx, where it can be risky to witness things. In the station house, Mr. Hubbard, carrying the stench of liquor, could not speak at first. Then he gave nonsensical answers, and he fell asleep. A couple of weeks after he was killed, Mr. Washingtons funeral was held in a small, plush chapel in Harlem. He was known as a stylish man, and his attire at the funeral was something of a compromise: the linen suit his grandmother would have wanted him to wear, and the more casual   and fitted cap that reflected his own tastes. (He had been increasingly attached to the hat, too, as a way of hiding his bald spot.) The observances in some ways resembled the family reunion that Mr. Washington had been trying to orchestrate in his last months. He had been separated from his siblings at age 5, when his mother put him and a younger brother into a cab by themselves, his older brother, Mr. Miller, said. When they arrived at a relatives home with unexplained burns on their backs, someone called the citys child welfare agency. The siblings soon were scattered across the city     some to foster homes, and others to relatives. Mr. Washington was taken in by his grandmother, a churchgoing woman who sent him to ballet classes and took him on trips to Europe. His mother became addicted to drugs, and though Mr. Washington still struggled with feelings of resentment, he had been trying in recent months to find a few lost siblings and bring everyone together for a gathering. He was also still, seven years after his grandmothers death, trying to climb out of the depression that had started after her passing. When Mr. Miller went into his brothers apartment after his death, he discovered that Mr. Washington had gotten rid of all of her old furniture. Eviction notices were piling up. After the funeral, Mr. Washingtons family held a repast in the basement of the Storefront Academy Harlem, a grade school he attended. Over plates of fried chicken prepared by his mother, peoples tears gave way to happier recollections. Rihanna blared out of a few speakers. Everyone was dressed in white. Without anyone seeming to mean to, a circle of friends and family formed around an open stretch of floor. Into the middle burst Mr. Miller, in immaculate white   and Mr. Washingtons uncle, Dasean Miller, who wore a heavy,   jacket. Before anyone could process it, their bodies were a whirl of white cloth, top hats and gold chains. Its crazy because this is what we were doing that night, Ms. Vargas whispered. And thats Julian, she said, pointing to Guy Miller. He dances just like Julian."
"Tim Cook, Eric Schmidt, Jeff Bezos Praise Trump Admin After White House Tech Meeting - Breitbart",Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/19/2017,"Some of the top CEOs of technology companies in America met with Donald Trump at the White House on Monday, praising him for hosting an afternoon summit on important tech issues. [Im absolutely convinced that during your administration there is going to be a huge explosion of new opportunities because of the platforms that are getting built in our industry, Schmidt said to Trump after the meeting, as over a dozen CEOs went around the table to make comments after the meeting.  Schmidt said that the combination of entrepreneurs, skilled workers, and immigration would provide huge growth in the American economy. Its going to happen soon during your leadership, he predicted. Apple CEO Tim Cook said he was pleased that Trumps    Jared Kushner and his daughter Ivanka Trump were bringing technology companies together in the Trump administration to help streamline government. The U. S. should have the most modern government in the world, and today it doesnt, he said, predicting that the tech innovations made in the Trump administration would pay back immensely in the future. Cook also offered advice to Trump, suggesting that the federal government needs to be more focused on the people, which was not how it currently operated. The government should be focused on its citizens, and the services of the government should be measured on how pleased the citizens are with receiving its services, he said. Cook also told Trump that computer coding should be a requirement for public schools. We have a huge deficit in the skills that we need today, vs. the skills that are there, he said. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos also praised Trumps administration for forming the tech innovation council, telling Trump that his team could be the innovation administration.  He advised Trump to use more commercial technologies in government to save taxpayers money. I think you guys are already headed that way, he said, adding that he wanted to see more worker   and tech skill development. He also urged more awareness of artificial intelligence. I think it would be impossible to overstate this, is that the United States needs to     in every way at every level     be working on machine learning and artificial intelligence, he said. That can be used in every part of government to improve the services that government provides to citizens.  Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also thanked Trump for the opportunity and said he hoped that Trump would continue both government spending on technology and enlightened immigration policies that would allow them to stay competitive. Over a dozen tech CEOs attended the meeting and appeared optimistic about what was possible during this administration. Trump appeared open to working with them on issues they cared about, including immigration. [W]ere working very diligently with everybody, including Congress, on immigration so that you can get the people you want in your companies, he said.  Peter Thiel     the most high profile venture capitalist in Silicon Valley, who endorsed Trump     praised the president for highlighting the importance of technology. I think that the tech industry is an industry that is doing well in America and we need to sort of make it do even better, he said, calling for ongoing government and regulatory support. I think your administration is off to a terrific start in doing these things.  After Akamai CEO Tom Leighton talked about his companys effort to secure government websites, Trump quipped back, The DNC could have used you.  Its an important job and as you can imagine, theres a lot of folks out there doing a lot of bad things, he replied.

Diane Abbott (@HackneyAbbott) May 23, 2017,  Abbott used similar language following the terror attack on London Bridge and Borough Market on June 3rd, in which   former child refugee Khuram Butt, bogus asylum seeker Rachid Redouane, and EU national Youssef Zaghba ran down and stabbed dozens of people in London. The Jeremy Corbyn ally was careful to refer to the terror attacks as incidents in two separate tweets.

"Kasparov: Need to Recognize the Inevitability of Machines Taking Jobs, Its Called Progress - Breitbart",Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/19/2017,"Russian chess grandmaster and former World Chess Champion Garry Kasparov claimed people need to embrace the replacement of jobs by robots and start focusing on tasks that they cant perform. [We have to start recognizing inevitability of machines taking over more and more tasks that we used to do in the past. Its called progress, Kasparov declared in an interview with the BBC. Machines replace farm animals, and almost all forms of manual labor, and now machines are about to take over more menial parts of cognition. Big deal. So its happening and we should not be alarmed about it, we should just take it as a fact, and look into the future trying to understand how can we adjust? .   Future is a   prophecy. If were negative, something wrong will happen, he continued. Im not telling you that if were positive it will get avoided, but at least we have a chance to determine in that venture. When people say we dont know whats going to happen next, fantastic. Thats exactly the reason for us to move there because we dont know that was one of the main driving forces in history of humanity.  In 1997, Kasparov became the first World Chess Champion to lose to a machine, after his defeat to the Deep Blue IBM supercomputer. Everything we do, and we know how we do, machines will do better eventually, explained Kasparov. But theres so many things we dont know how we do, and lets concentrate on that, because machines have algorithms and theyre getting better and better, but machines have no curiosity, no passion, and most of all, machines dont have purpose.  If we look back forty, fifty years, we realized there were so many great things we could do and we actually were involved, like space exploration, or deep ocean exploration, he concluded. We stopped, because it was too risky. Now with this massive power that A. I. brings to the table, maybe we should start doing it again. Its all about new challenges, its all about new horizons.

Election Eve Poll in Georgias Sixth Congressional District: Republican Handel Leads by 2 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,6/19/2017,"Republican Karen Handel leads Democrat Jon Ossoff by two points in the final poll of Georgias Sixth Congressional District special election released by the Trafalgar Group late Monday afternoon. [Polling places open less than 24 hours from now for the June 20 runoff to replace Rep. Tom Price ( ) now the Secretary of Health and Human Services.  The survey of 1, 100 respondents has a margin of error of 2. 9 percent, and was conducted over two days between June 17th (Saturday) and June 18th (Sunday). This 6th District survey breaks down the voters preference in the 2017 special election runoff. The Trafalgar Group (TFG) recognized for having the best polling in the 2016 battleground states and Electoral College projection, conducted the poll from June 17th through June 18th, according to the polling firms release: The voters were asked their preferred candidate in the Congressional District 6 race. The results were: 50. 46% Handel48. 59% Ossoff0. 95% Undecided, The Trafalgar Group noted that [t]he results for those who claimed to have already voted early are as follows: 51. 32% Ossoff, 48. 68% Handel.  The Handel momentum we saw last week continues and has been intensified as Handel consolidates Republican leaning voters, Robert Cahaly of the Trafalgar Group said of the latest poll. He went on to say: There is no doubt in my mind that the shooting at the GOP Congressional Baseball practice has had an impact, but I dont see that it is the impact that most pundits expect. This tragedy and the attempt to place the blame on   rhetoric has actually served to motivate frustrated Republicans who were considering sitting the election out or voting for Ossoff. The shift we see toward Handel in the closing days of this race is a bit of GOP homecoming. These disenchanted Republicans are beginning to put their concerns aside and see this election as a choice   a choice between the Party and leaders theyre disappointed in and a Democrat Party and leaders that trouble them even more. Two polls released on Friday by   Savvy and   Communications showed the race in a statistical tie. Ossoff had a 1. 7 percent lead in the    Communications poll and less than one percent lead in the   Savvy poll. Since the margin of error for the Trafalgar Group poll released on Monday is 2. 9 percent, the two percent Handel advantage is also within the margin of error. The Trafalgar Group is primarily used by Republican candidates. It has a strong recent track record, as it notes in its release: The Trafalgar Group is widely recognized as the best polling firm of the 2016 election cycle, correctly forecasting the results in key battleground and other states (PA, FL, NC, MI, OH, CO, GA) and exactly predicting the Trump electoral college margin of victory ( ). The results and information of their polls have been featured in thousands of U. S. and global news stories, television networks, and   polling web sites like Real Clear Politics.

Exclusive - Karen Handel: I Intend to Have the Last Laugh When I Win - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/19/2017,"Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel told Breitbart News on Monday morning that she intends to overcome Nancy Pelosis Democrats, and liberal media bias, by winning the special election for Georgias 6th congressional district on Tuesday. [There has definitely been a significant bias from the local media like nothing like I have ever experienced, she told Breitbart News in a telephone interview. But I intend to have the last laugh when I win tomorrow.   Handel, a former Georgia Secretary of State, is currently running    with Democrat Jon Ossoff in the race to replace Dr. Tom Price, who was appointed by President Donald Trump as Secretary of Health and Human Services earlier this year. Ossoff is a newcomer to politics who actually lives outside the district, but who has energized Democratic activists and donors nationwide in the primary race in April by shaping his campaign as a referendum on the Trump administration. Republicans in the district told Breitbart News during a visit Sunday that they were cautiously optimistic, despite poll numbers showing a dead heat or Ossoff with a small but significant lead. Handel shared their optimism: I feel great about things     early voting numbers that weve seen look very positive for me, and Republicans tend to be strong on Election Day, she said. Politico reported on Sunday night that Republicans believe massive early voting numbers     over 140, 000     favor them, and that they hope to capitalize on the fact that there are more Republican voters in the district. The race has involved some $50 million in spending on both sides, making it the most expensive race in congressional history. On Monday morning, President Trump tweeted his support for the campaign, urging people to [V]ote now for Karen H (though early voting ended on Friday): The Dems want to stop tax cuts, good healthcare and Border Security. Their ObamaCare is dead with 100% increases in Ps. Vote now for Karen H,     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 19, 2017, In the face of Democrats efforts to make the race about Trump, Handel said that she had neither distanced herself nor tied herself to the president. The only people who want to make this about other things are, frankly, reporters like you and others out there, she told Breitbart News. This race is about the people of the 6th district.  One of the major national issues     aside from Trump himself     is health care, with Republicans ongoing efforts to repeal Obamacare criticized by both liberals (for tampering with an entitlement) and conservatives (for not going far enough). But Handel says that has not been a big factor in the race. It hasnt been that much of an issue on the ground, she told Breitbart News. For voters in the 6th district, the biggest issue is that Jon Ossoff is from outside the district.  Asked why Democrats in the district did not seem to mind that, Handel said: Hes completely aligned with [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi        [Democrats] want someone who will march lockstep with the liberal mantra.  Other issues, she said, were veterans issues, transportation infrastructure, the fight against terrorism, [the] budget, and the economy       issues.  Last week, Handels campaign were mailed packages that contained threatening letters and a suspicious substance.  She told Breitbart that the threats had the effect of making me and everyone around me more determined to win on Tuesday.  As for last Wednesdays shooting attack on Republican congressmen in Alexandria, Virginia, she said that she and her campaign had refused to politicize it. No one from my camp is going to be making anything political for that.  She concluded: I think its going to go well for me and for Republicans. We will show the country, and all the eyes on the district, that Nancy Pelosi is not going to come into the district and steal the seat out from under us.  Election Day is tomorrow, June 20, and both parties seem to expect a close result. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Donald Trump Unleashes Twitter Support for Karen Handel - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/19/2017,"President Donald Trump took to Twitter to support Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel on Monday, just hours before voters in Georgia go to the polls. [Karen Handels opponent in #GA06 cant even vote in the district he wants to represent because he doesnt even live there! Trump scoffed on Twitter about Democrat candidate Jon Ossoff. He wants to raise taxes and kill healthcare.   Trump urged voters to vote for Handel during the last day of campaigning. The election is Tuesday. Handel is running to succeed Tom Price, who left office to work as the Secretary for Health and Human Services for the Trump administration. Polling shows the two candidates locked in a statistical tie as Republicans and Democrats have spent roughly $50 million on the race. A loss for Handel will be interpreted by the media as a sign that Trumps agenda is no longer supported by the American people who elected him. Handel also recently welcomed House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to campaign for her, as well as House Speaker Paul Ryan. The group Bikers for Trump was also recently spotted in Georgia campaigning for Handel."
White House Tech Summit Includes Discussion of H1-B Visas - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/19/2017,"President Donald Trump and his team of White House officials will discuss the issue of   visas during the tech summit Monday     an issue of high importance for CEOs in the tech industry. [The president is going into this meeting to listen, White House press secretary Sean Spicer responded, when asked by Breitbart News if the president was open to the idea of expanding   visas.  According to a White House official,   visas would be one of many topics discussed with White House staff and the CEOs during the meeting. Spicer pointed to Trumps promised reform of the entire visa program when asked about whether or not he supported the   visa program     one that allows some foreign investors in American businesses to legally stay in the United States. At a Republican primary debate at Miami University during the campaign, Trump said that he favored ending the program. I know the   very well. We shouldnt have it, its very, very bad for workers, he said, calling it unfair to our workers.  The   tech meeting began this afternoon with remarks from White House senior advisor Jared Kushner, who focused on the changes that technology companies could bring to the United States government. Together we will unleash the creativity of the private sector to provide citizen services in a way that has never happened before, Kushner said. Trump is expected to make remarks later this afternoon."

Caddell: Anti-Trump Resistance Rhetoric Fueling Raging Fever in Unbalanced People,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,6/19/2017,"Pat Caddell talked all things media and President Trump with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Alex Marlow on Monday. [Caddell said, I think they are united in a narrative. And that narrative is, somebody did something wrong. It was Donald Trump and therefore, at the end of the day, he must not be president.   Theyre still fighting the campaign that they lost, he added, meaning the media. They will not put out things that disagree with their narrative, said Caddell. Thats when they stop being a press. Theyve become propagandists and this is really dangerous stuff. It is really scary because for many voters, they dont know where to turn, necessarily, to get a view that gives them both sides.  Caddell said it started the day after the election when Democrats declared, were not going to be a loyal opposition, were going to be a resistance, as though we were being occupied. When rational voices take that stand, when the heat becomes so great in the kitchen, let me tell you something, if the rest of us are getting a temperature, the people who are unbalanced are getting a raging fever.

"Car rams police van on Champs-Elysees, armed suspect dead",CNN,Melissa Bell,6/19/2017,"Paris (CNN) Tourists strolling along Paris famous   on Monday afternoon watched in horror as a car rammed into a police van    and some witnessed the car burst into flames as police grabbed the man inside and put him on the ground. The armed driver deliberately plowed into the police vehicle and later died, authorities said.  We were waiting to cross the street and suddenly heard an explosion and the car was in flames, said Eugenio Morcilla, who captured video after the collision. The police acted very quickly. Early Tuesday, the Paris prosecutors office confirmed four of the drivers family members were being held by police.  Its the latest in a series of terror attacks this year against security forces in the French capital. The Paris prosecutors office has opened an   investigation. Once again, Frances security forces have been targeted in an attempted attack on the   Interior Minister Gerard Collomb told reporters on Monday. According to CNN affiliate BFMTV, the driver was under what is known as a Fiche S file, a French   watch list composed of thousands of names, of which some are under active surveillance. Active surveillance means that they are on law enforcements radar, not necessarily under rigorous surveillance. The incident, which took place at 3:40 p. m. local time (9:40 a. m. ET) began when a police squadron drove down the   and an individual hit the first vehicle of the squad. The car contained weapons, explosives, enough to allow him to blow up this car, Collomb said. The small white car caught on fire after the collision, but neither officers nor members of the public were hurt, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Morcilla, who was in Paris on vacation with his girlfriend, took video of the aftermath of the attack. They got out of a police truck and tried to break the glass and take the man out, they shot and threw tear gas and they took him out by force. .. he said. Security forces were working to identify the weapons in the vehicle, and they are investigating the individuals past and see what motives pushed him to take action, Collomb said. This shows once again that the threat level in France is extremely high, the interior minister said. Earlier, police advised people to avoid the area, as about 20 police vans and several armed officers surrounded the man on the ground.  Its the fifth time in four months that security forces have been attacked in the capital.    Last month, a man attacked an officer with a hammer at   Cathedral, proclaiming, This is for Syria, Collomb said. The officers injuries were not serious.    In April, a man shot at police officers    also on the      killing one officer and wounding two others. Police shot and killed Karim Cheurfi as he tried to escape on the busy tourist boulevard. ISIS said the man was one of its fighters, and Cheurfi had a note defending ISIS in his pocket.    In March, a man holding a gun on a French female soldier at Orly Airport shouted, I am here to die in the name of Allah . .. There will be deaths, before two of the soldiers comrades shot the attacker dead.    In February, a soldier shot a   man who rushed toward a group of soldiers and guards near the Louvre museum."
"Otto Warmbier, American Taken Hostage by North Korea, Dies Days After Return to U.S. - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/19/2017,"Otto Warmbier, an American student detained in North Korea for committing hostile acts has died, his parents confirmed Tuesday in a statement. He was 22. [Warmbier, who returned to America last Tuesday, having previously been sentenced to 15 years hard labor after stealing   paraphernalia from his hotel, had lapsed into a coma before his return. The North Korean government claimed Warmbier had contracted botulism shortly after his conviction of crimes against the communist state in March 2016.  Doctors treating Warmbier upon his return to Ohio stated, however, that they found no evidence of botulism, instead finding extensive brain damage.  The North Korean government has not remarked on the discrepancy or provided any explanation for what could have caused Warmbier such brain damage in prison. It is our sad duty to report that our son, Otto Warmbier, has completed his journey home, his family wrote in a statement. We would like to thank the wonderful professionals at Cincinnati Medical Center who did everything they could for Otto. Unfortunately, the awful torturous treatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today.  Otto Warmbier,    US student detained in North Korea, dies after returning home in coma pic. twitter.      Jason Calabretta (@JasonCalabretta) June 19, 2017,  According to the Warmbier family, Otto was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands.  Warmbier had gone to North Korea in early 2016 on an adventure tour of the rogue state, under the auspices of the   Young Pioneer Tours, which preys on the curiosity of young westerners by offering Budget tours to destinations your mother wants you to stay away from! Warmbier was arrested during his visit for allegedly having attempted to steal a communist propaganda sign and forced to confess to the serious crime on North Korean television in February 2016. Warmbier pleaded guilty to taking down a political sign from a   area of his hotel. I have made the worst mistake of my life, but please act to save me, he said at the time. Under duress, Warmbier accused the United States of bribing him to steal the sign, calling it the worst mistake of my life.   In an appearance carefully choreographed by North Korean authorities, Warmbier said that although his crime was very severe and  he was grateful for the regimes humanitarian treatment of severe criminals.  Warmbier was sentenced to 15 years hard labor for his crime.  North Korea continues to imprison three other U. S. citizens: academics Kim   and Tony Kim, and businessman Kim  . Update: President Donald Trump has released a statement on Warmbiers passing: Melania and I offer our deepest condolences to the family of Otto Warmbier on his untimely passing. There is nothing more tragic for a parent than to lose a child in the prime of life. Our thoughts and prayers are with Ottos family and friends, and all who loved him. Ottos fate deepens my Administrations determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim."

EXCLUSIVE: Watch - Israeli Envoy Dani Dayan: Campaign to Silence Pro-Israel Voices on U.S. Campuses a Real War,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/19/2017,"NEW YORK     Addressing the phenomenon of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement targeting the Jewish state, Dani Dayan, Israels Consul General in New York, declared that the real war is the intimidation, disruption and attempted silencing of   voices on U. S. college campuses. [There we have a real war, Dayan said, referring to attempts to shut down freedom of expression for Israel defenders on American campuses. And we have to be much more aggressive, much more assertive.        But it is not only an Israeli problem, what is happening on many campuses across America. I think it is first and foremost an American problem.   Dayan was speaking to this reporter during an onstage interview at the JBiz Expo, an annual business networking and   event hosted by the Orthodox Jewish Chamber of Commerce. Last month, Dayan himself was repeatedly heckled and disrupted during a speech at the City College of New York. There, students from the CCNY chapter of the Students for Justice in Palestine and other   groups protested and temporarily disrupted the event. At the Jbiz Expo interview, Dayan vowed to return to CCNY. We should not give any ground to our enemies, he stated. On the contrary, I will make a point of coming to the same place again next year and the next semester. And we must persevere.  Regarding the   actions on U. S. campuses, Dayan surmised, In some senses, I think we are in the same boat, as we say sometimes in Israel, with other movements that their freedom of speech is obstructed on many campuses.  He continued: It happens on the West Coast. It happens on the East Coast. I think as a foreign representative I have to be very careful but I think it is a problem that American society has to deal with not only in respect to Israel.  In some senses, it is the same phenomenon that we see on campuses by extreme elements that are also   but not only  . In some cases they are even  . And we as Israel, we have to be relentless. We cannot give up.  BDS is Big Failure Turning to the larger BDS campaign to boycott Israels economic and cultural institutions, Dayan used the occasion to declare the BDS movement a big failure.  Lets not forget that, he stated. You know, I saw a survey of the market value of the companies targeted by BDS and all of them     for sure the average, maybe there was one that for common business reasons didnt     but on the average they made twice the market performance. So the economic BDS is a total failure. And it is sufficient to see the shape of Israels economy these days.  Dayan pointed to the trend of major U. S. and international companies purchasing Israeli   firms as well as top tech companies maintaining satellite headquarters in Israel. In March, Intel purchased the Israeli driverless vehicles company Mobileye for $15. 3 billion. We think of ourselves as an Israeli company as much as a US company, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich said at a Jerusalem press conference alongside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu following the Mobileye acquisition. So Israels economy is doing extremely well, added Dayan.  The shekel, which I remember having a 400% annual rate of inflation, today is the strongest currency in the world. If thats not a miracle I dont know what a miracle is.  Dayan also declared the cultural BDS movement a total failure and he poked fun at   advocate Roger Waters, who has led an effort to persuade performers to boycott the Jewish state. I cant keep track of the rock and pop and   bands that come to Israel, he said. From Lady Gaga to Madonna. And yesterday I think was one of the oldies, Rod Stewart, performing in Tel Aviv. So there is this nudnik Roger Waters from Pink Floyd. We cant survive without him? Aaron Klein is Breitbarts Jerusalem bureau chief and senior investigative reporter.

Early reviews praise Megyn Kellys controversial interview with far-right provocateur Alex Jones,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/19/2017,"NBC anchor Megyn Kelly faced more than a week of withering   backlash over her decision to interview Alex Jones,    the   founder of Infowars. com, a site that has   perpetuated conspiracy theories about   and the 2012 school   shooting in Newtown, Connecticut.     Kelly was uninvited as a guest at a gala hosted by relatives of   the victims of the Sandy Hook elementary shooting in Connecticut,   which left 20 children dead, and J. P. Morgan pulled its ads from   the broadcast.     But when the piece aired Sunday evening, most of the   reviews from a skeptical audience were positive. Observers   heaped praise on the fact that Kellys highly edited piece   frequently reminded viewers of Jones conspiracies about   Newtown, the September 11 terror attacks, and a host of other   topics.      If this had been a 60 Minutes interview, Jones did enough   shuffling to look plenty squirrelly, without delivering what   might be called a classic Mike Wallace moment, CNN critic Brian   Lowry .     ttt. scored high marks with Alex Jones interview. Nailed the scumbug. tt  tttSeeing a lot of positive reviews like this    tttyup good work by . Would love to know how much editing was done following public outcry.     tttThis intvw was always supposed to be 4 ppl who didnt   knew who Jones was. For those ppl, they saw a sweaty conspiracy theoristtt  tttWatching  interview with Alex Jones, Im even more convinced that her piece wasnt just ok to do, but important journalism. tt   Kelly did more to expose the real Alex Jones and than anyone else on TV. Solid journalism. tt    Others, like Washington Post media writer Margaret Sullivan and   Matthew Gertz of the   watchdog group Media Matters,   said that although Kelly landed blows, Jones would   ultimately benefit from some of the networks exposure.     tttWashington Post media columnist and former public editor of the New York Times    tttMy take on Megyn Kellys Alex Jones segment, a competent piece that underscores the effectiveness of public pressure       For all the hype that Jones built up to the broadcast, his   reaction seemed somewhat subdued considering his historic rants   against critics of his work.      On a livestream airing after the broadcast, Jones oscillated   between opinions about the segment.     At points, he lamented the editing of the piece,   telling viewers that they were watching his unedited   livestream and urging Kelly to disavow what he said were threats   he received on social media during the broadcast. But at other   points, he declared victory, popping a bottle of champagne while   simultaneously arguing the broadcast was a letdown.     It was kind of a  Jones said. Everyone who has   texted me says it was nothing.     Although the segment delivered little in terms of new   information     Jones had previously been confronted about   many of the conspiratorial claims on which he was pressed       Kellys segment addressed some of the concerns critics expressed   leading up to the broadcast.     The New York Post  that the   piece was edited again this week to take a more critical   tone on Jones work, while    audio leaked by   Jones himself showed Kelly .

Russia: US planes over western Syria now air targets,CNN,Pamela Boykoff,6/19/2017,"Moscow (CNN) A day after a US Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane, Russia warned that aircraft operating where the shootdown occurred would be considered air targets for its forces in Syria. The Russian Ministry of Defense called the downing of the plane a cynical violation of the sovereignty of the Syrian Arab Republic and military aggression. As a result, it said, Russia has stopped using a key   communication channel set up to avoid conflict between US and Russian forces in Syria. While both the US and Russia say their forces are in Syria to fight ISIS infiltration there, Russia has allied itself with the regime of Syrian President Bahsar   while the   coalition has aligned with groups that oppose both the Assad regime and ISIS. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said Monday the US shootdown of the Syrian   was an act of assistance to those terrorists whom the United States is ostensibly fighting against, according to Russias   news agency Tass. The Syrian military acknowledged the loss of its aircraft and said the pilot was missing after ejecting. Its the first time the US has shot down a Syrian aircraft since it began fighting ISIS in the country in 2014. This strike can be regarded as another act of defiance of international law by the United States, Ryabkov said. Russia: Aircraft west of Euphrates River are targets The Russian Defense Ministry said it would exert new control over the skies of western Syria. From now on, in areas where Russian aviation performs combat missions in the skies of Syria, any airborne objects found west of the Euphrates River, including aircraft and unmanned vehicles belonging to the international coalition, tracked by means of Russian land and air   defense, will be considered air targets, the Defense Ministry statement reads. Coalition forces released a response within hours of the Kremlin statements. As a result of recent encounters involving pro Syrian regime and Russian forces, we have taken prudent measures to reposition aircraft over Syria so as to continue targeting ISIS forces while ensuring the safety of our aircrews given known threats in the battle space, coalition spokesman Col. Ryan Dillon told CNN. We are continuing to conduct operations throughout Syria targeting ISIS forces and providing air support for coalition forces and our partner forces on the ground, Dillon said. We as a coalition are always ready to deconflict. An escalated threat, A defense official told CNN the belief is the potential threat has escalated given recent encounters with   forces near At Tanf, as well as the downing of the Syrian aircraft.  In Washington, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph Dunford, said communication between Russia and the US remains open. Dunford said the US is working diplomatically and militarily to reestablish a   channel. I am also confident that our forces have the capability to take care of themselves, Dunford added. The worst thing any of us can do right now is to address this thing with hyperbole. This is not the first time that Russia has said the   channel has been suspended. In April, after the US missile strike on a Syrian airbase, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Russia would suspend the 2015 agreement aimed at minimizing risks of   incidents. The US military is prohibited by law from coordinating directly with the Russian military, but given the increased pace and scale of military operations in Syria, the US and Russia have sought ways to ensure that their respective personnel are not targeted by mistake, setting up a series of     zones that delineate areas of operation for the coalition and the Russian forces. Analysts see positioning, With ISIS now significantly weakened, analysts believe all all parties in Syria are maneuvering to consolidate their positions for an eventual settlement of the conflict.  Jeremy Binnie, Middle East and Africa editor for Janes Defence Weekly, says the players in Syria are now operating with half an eye on the   State situation, and looking to control as much territory as possible.  Related: Explaining the complex crisis in Syria, Russia could work to   the situation, but Moscow is looking increasingly less like an honest mediator between the sides, he says.  We dont know until we see how it plays out in reality, but it is definitely Russia making a pretty strong statement in favor of the Assad government.  Dmitry Trenin, director of the Carnegie Moscow Center, says the events of Sunday and Monday are a significant escalation, which could result in a collision between the two sides. To defuse the situation, he said, the US needs to begin to see Russia as a more equal partner in determining the future of Syria. It is time for diplomacy, he said."
"Limbaugh: Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, Nancy Pelosi Wrote the Script for Scalises Shooter - Breitbart",Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/19/2017,"Monday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh argued that although leaders in the Democratic Party were not directly responsible for the shooting last week at a congressional GOP baseball practice in Alexandria, VA, they did write the script for the action.  That shooting resulted in House Majority Whip Steve Scalise in a hospital in critical condition, Limbaugh pointed   shooter James Hodgkinson social media posts and letters to the editor espousing his liberal views and named House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sens. Bernie Sanders ( ) and Elizabeth Warren ( ) specifically as being responsible for the script.  Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): So we got all these investigations, even though we hadnt found any proof in over a year, and even though there isnt any proof because it didnt happen. But try telling them that. So as nothing happens, as they are told that Trump stole the election, that Trump profited from the election, that Trump has secret bank accounts all over the world in the Caymans and the Cook Islands. Hes got a bunch of shell corporations that hes getting rich off of being president, sos Ivanka, so is Jared, sos all of his kids. If youre told this every day and then youre told that theyve got the goods. Were gonna get Trump. Hes gonna be impeached. We got the independent counsel now, its only a matter of time.  But nothing changes, nothing happens. The only thing that happens is more criticism. Meanwhile, Trumps there every day, and hes having meetings, and hes traveling around going to the Saudi Arabia summit, meeting with NATO, and he just canceled climate change. I mean, the cumulative psychological effective on these people like Hodgkinson, dont tell me the Democrats are not responsible for it. They have created the  . Theyve created these monsters out there. And all for what purpose? Because the Democrats refuse to get in the arena of ideas and debate those. They refuse because they cant win. And to see how lacking those ideas are, just listen to the insane ramblings of Hodgkinson. Just look at the things that he talks about. Just look at the class warfare, the class envy, the things that he believes. Its fringe crazy. But he believed it because thats what hes been told. The Democrats, therefore, cant take that stuff in the arena of ideas. Theyd be snookered. So what they have to do is destroy the credibility, the integrity, the honesty, the reputations of every one of their opponents, and thats what they do. That is what theyre doing now to Trump. Theyre trying to destroy Trump and anybody around him as having no decency. Hes got no honor. . Hes got no integrity. Hes a thief, he stole the election. The idea that we have a heated political atmosphere and a growing divide. And, if you want to assume the Republicans are equally as bad. No, theyre not. The Republicans are a bunch of pansies. Theyre always talking about crossing the aisle and working with these people. The Republicans run around when they campaign, Im the guy that can cross the aisle. Im the guy that can reach compromise. Im the guy that can work with the Democrats. Im the guy that can show cooperation. Im the guy that can demonstrate Washington can work.  The Republicans dont do what the Democrats do. They dont even get close to doing what the Democrats do and the media. Cause the medias actually leading it. But Bernie Sanders, if you go look at what Bernie Sanders says, if you go read what hes written     I hate to say it this way, I could have the evidence for you here. I had it last week but I threw all that stuff away and didnt have time to reconstruct it. This guy Hodgkinson was an echo chamber. Whatever Bernie Sanders said was this guys letter to the editor. This guy went on a rant. He went into a sports bar and just started ranting and maybe everybody nervous as hell in there. He made the female bartender nervous. He came across like a sexual predator, and he was angry and deranged, just started on a rant. He wasnt even teed up. He walked in with this giant chip on his shoulder. The AP reports that Hodgkinson took his car to a mechanic one day before the shooting. He wanted the mechanic to verify that his tires would make the trip back to his home in Illinois. But while he was there, he started venting his rage about President Trump.  Crist Dauberman, the mechanic, said, This man was just so passionate and hateful toward (President Donald) Trump.  Among other things, Hodgkinson said Trump had screwed up the country more than anyone in the history of this country.  He said, It was more than the average person who had maybe voted for Hillary. This was different. It was deeply rooted to where his whole tone and composure changed. His voice got loud and deep. There was so much anger in it.  Now, listen to what Bernie Sanders was saying just a few days before Hodgkinsons outburst at the garage, this mechanics place. Today in the White House we have perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country, and we also have not to be forgotten extreme   leadership in the U. S. House and the U. S. Senate.  Sanders makes that speech on June the 10th. It was reported on in many   elements on June the 11th and June 12th, one day before Mr. Hodgkinson shot Scalise. The New York Times even noted that particular quote in the opening paragraph of a story immediately after the shooting. So Bernie says, Today in the White House we have perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country.  The day before shooting, Hodgkinson is in a mechanics place, and he said Trump has screwed up the country more than anyone in the history of this country, using Bernie Sanders exact words. So you can say all you want that Bernie Sanders is not responsible, and I understand people wanting to do that, but this guy Hodgkinson? Bernie Sanders was his writer. And so was Elizabeth Warren, and so was Pelosi and all of these other media types and Democrats. They were writing the script for this guy. You can see it in his letters to the editor and so forth. He went to that baseball game, the practice, with a list of names, Republican lawmakers names. These were potential victims. Now, the FBI and the media are saying, We dont really know why he had a list of names with him. We really are kind of in the dark about that. Were not really sure.  A person told the AP on Saturday, Investigators arent sure of the significance of the names. They dont know if it was a list of people he was targeting.  Really? He shoots up a baseball practice, including Scalise, a couple of Capitol Hill cops and some other people. They find a list of other Republican names on him and they dont know what it means?

Leon Panetta: We Have a Dysfunctional Presidency at This Moment in Time - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/19/2017,"Monday on CNNs Situation Room, when asked about the political fight over the Republican health care bill, former CIA Director Leon Panetta called the Donald Trump presidency dysfunctional.   Panetta said, This is a moment when, you know, you wonder why there are angry and frustrated people in this country who look to Washington and see very little getting done. And, you know, we have   theres no question we have a dysfunctional Congress. I think to some extent we have a dysfunctional presidency as well at this moment in time. And I think everything, everything that can be done to try to put pressure on both Republicans and Democrats to work together to try to resolve these key issues, particularly on health care, is something that ought to be done now.  I know the Democrats have to fight the Republicans, he continued. I know the Republicans are doing their thing to try to keep this within the party. But I really think that both parties need to look at the larger picture here, which is that literally, the United States of America will be affected by what they do, and they cant do this in secret, and they cant do this simply by fighting each other over these kinds of issues. They have to learn to work together to do what is right for our country.  Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"
CNNs Acosta on Off-Camera Gaggles: This Isnt How We Do Things in This Country - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/19/2017,"Monday on CNNs Newsroom,  senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta criticized White House press secretary Sean Spicer for holding     press gaggles instead of the traditional   daily White House briefings.  Partial transcript as follows: BALDWIN: Just into CNN, the White House telling reporters in an   briefing a bit about the possibility of tapes being released, perhaps, but it sounds like maybe, not a lot. Jim Acosta is our senior White House correspondent who left the     briefing. I saw your tweet. Youre feeling like they are stonewalling? ACOSTA:  The White House mandated that we are not allowed to cover the White House press secretary for the United States of America in that fashion. So yes, when were asking important questions about   where is the tape? Does the president have recordings of conversations here? The White House is refusing to answer those questions on camera or in any kind of fashion where we can record the audio. My guess is because they want their evasive answers not saved for posterity. That is the only conclusion one could draw. That when they give you answers, that it somehow reads better in print than it could be being seen on television or heard over the radio. There were a number of important questions asked about the health care bill that is being cobbled together in the Senate and what the White House has to say about that. You wont hear or see those answers. The question was asked whether the president has the ability to fire Robert Mueller, you wont hear or see the answers to those questions. Youll only be able to read about it. And people will probably go, the media is cry babies, they cant cover the way they want. Maybe Im   but I think the White House for the United States of America should have the questions answered on camera. When they dont do this, theyre doing a disservice to the people of the country. I dont want to sound like Im getting on my soapbox, but when Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary, who is pretty highly paid as a White House official, comes in and says you cant record the video or audio from these briefings     that wouldnt be tolerated at city council meetings or a governors press conference    here we have the representative of the President of the United States saying, No, you cant cover it that way. I just dont know what we are doing. Its not even like we are covering a White House with Kellyanne Conway and Omarosa in the briefing room off to the side of Sean refusing to be on camera. Its just like we are covering bad reality television, is what it feels like now. BALDWIN: Well, Im with you. Im   and I stand with you. On your evasive answers note, I understand he gave another evasive answer. ACOSTA: Thats right. He was asked   because the president said this more than a week ago, he was going to answer this question, where are these tapes? The president said you would find out about that shortly. More has gone by, and Sean Spicer said off camera, no audio, perhaps well have an answer this week. Sean told us in the past he would get an answer whether the president believes in climate change. The question was asked   have you gone back and asked the question to that? He did not have an answer to that question, on a matter that happened a couple weeks ago. So the White House press secretary is getting to a point, Brooke, where he is kind of useless. You know, if he cant come out and answer the questions and theyre not going to do the audio, why even have they gaggles in the first place? BALDWIN: Is he not even having conversations with the president? Does he simply not know? ACOSTA: Its a really good question, Brooke, a question I would ask, but unfortunately at this White House, we wouldnt have the video or audio to show you the answer to that question because of the stonewalling were getting here at the White House. Thats the White House behind me. The White House. And its just   its bizarre. I dont know what world were living in where were standing at the White House, and they bring us into the briefing room here and they wont answer these questions on camera or let us record the audio. I dont know why everybody is going along with this. It just doesnt make sense, and it just sort of feels like were sort of slowly but surely by being dragged into a new normal where the President of the United States is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions. He hasnt had a   press conference since February. He has the    press conferences with a foreign head of state where he may take a question from a conservative news media reporter, and maybe somebody from the mainstream. This isnt how we do things in this country. But for whatever reason, were all going along with it. I dont understand why we covered that gaggle today, quite honestly, Brooke. If they cant give the answers to the questions on camera or where we can report the audio, theyre basically pointless. Youre not getting the chance to see   are they evading the question? The transcript doesnt really show that, and I think smart people who have been doing this for a long time understand that. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

It would help if at the White House it was toned down a little bit, too because people know Congress as a bunch of faces     535.

"London mosque attack suspect named, according to media outlets",CNN,Angela Dewan,6/19/2017,"London (CNN) The driver of the van that plowed into pedestrians near a mosque in north London has been identified as Darren Osborne, 47, a resident of Cardiff in Wales, according to multiple UK media outlets. One man died and nine people were hospitalized following the assault, the latest in a series of terror attacks to hit the United Kingdom this year. The driver, a white man, was wrestled to the ground by members of the public and then arrested at the scene, officials said. He was being held on suspicion of terrorism offenses, police said. Eyewitnesses reported chaotic scenes as the incident unfolded just after midnight, when evening Ramadan prayers had finished. British Prime Minister Theresa May said the attack was directed at Muslims and condemned it as every bit as sickening as deadly Islamist attacks that hit the country in recent months. I just cant believe that he did that Osborne, a father of four, is originally from the English county of Somerset, UK media reported. The Press Association reported that Osbornes neighbors were shocked at seeing photographs of him after the attack. Police said they were searching a residence in Cardiff in connection with the attack. That address is in Pentwyn, where Osborne is listed as living, the Press Association reported.  The suspect was not on the security services radar, Home Office Minister of Security Ben Wallace said. Saleem Naema, a    taxi driver, and his young son said the man pictured was their neighbor. I know him. Ive lived here for five years. He was already living here when I moved in, Naema said, according to the Press Association. If I ever needed anything he would come. I just cant believe that he did that. I am a Muslim, Naema added. Khadijeh Sherizi, who was also Osbornes neighbor, said: It is definitely him.  I saw him on the news and I thought Oh my God, that is my neighbor,  Sherizi told the Press Association. Sherizi said Osborne has been so normal. He was in his kitchen yesterday afternoon singing with his kids, Sherizi said. I just cant believe it, she added. Attacker shouted: I did my bit, you deserve it The suspect was first arrested for attempted murder and taken to a south London police station. Police later said he was also further arrested for the commission, preparation or instigation of terrorism, including murder. The van plowed into the worshipers on Seven Sisters Road, a busy thoroughfare in Finsbury Park, north London, near a Muslim community center and a mosque. Neil Basu, senior national coordinator for terrorism at the Metropolitan Police, confirmed witness accounts that the man found dead at the scene was already receiving first aid when the attack happened. He said it was unclear whether he died as a result of the attack.  Nine other people were taken to hospital, two of whom were seriously injured, he said. Two other people were treated at the scene. Police believed the attacker acted alone, despite earlier reports from witnesses, who had said they saw two other people flee the scene. Muslim Welfare House CEO Toufik Kacimi said the attacker shouted, I did my bit, you deserve it. An imam prevented people from taking revenge on the man, he said. Delay over terror call  Speaking at Downing Street, May said police decided to treat the incident as a terror attack within eight minutes of receiving the first emergency call.  Residents in Finsbury Park had criticized authorities for not declaring the incident as terrorism soon enough, and police only announced they were treating it as terror more than eight hours after the event. This was an attack on Muslims near their place of worship and, like all terrorism in whatever form, it shares the same fundamental goal. It seeks to drive us apart and to break the precious bonds of solidarity and citizenship which we share in this country, May said.  We will not let this happen.  The assault comes on the heels of an attack at London Bridge, in which three men rammed a van into pedestrians and went on a stabbing spree at nearby bars and restaurants, killing eight people. Mondays attack is the third in London since March involving a vehicle as a weapon against pedestrians. Emotions are high in the UK in the wake of a series of deadly terrorist attacks and a fire at a London apartment building that killed dozens. Basu said it was a challenging time for London and that the emergency services were stretched. What happened, Witnesses told CNN they saw a van driving at high speed along Seven Sisters Road after worshippers had attended   prayers at the Finsbury Park Mosque. Abdikadir Warfa said the van turned into an alleyway and hit a number of people before coming to a stop. Images from the scene showed a white van wedged against a traffic barrier at the dead end of a street. I saw a man, he was underneath the van, Warfa said, who described how his friends tried to lift the van to free him. He said as he attended the injured, others grappled with the driver as he tried to run away.  Ratib   was sitting two minutes away when the incident occurred. Some big van . .. crushing the people in the mosque. So we just run straight away, I see police, ambulance, people lying on the floor, and a van as well, said Sulaman.  Saeed Hashi described how he fought with the driver, and how he and two others held him to the ground for 10 minutes as they waited for police to arrive.  He punched me in the head, Hashi said, showing his bruises. The van used in the attack bears the logo and phone number for Pontyclun Van Hire in south Wales. CNN spoke to a man at the company, who said he was the owner but declined to give his name. He said police had instructed him not to speak to the media. Warnings of   attacks, Finsbury Park Mosque trustee Mohammed Kozbar met with interfaith leaders and said that an attack on one faith was an attack on all. Those who try to divide us and who aim to spread hate, fear and division will not succeed, Kozbar said after a minutes silence near the scene of the attack. A statement released by the Muslim Council of Britain condemned what it described as a terror attack. Tell MAMA, an   group, had visited Muslim Welfare House on Friday last week to inform the community about the need to report   hate incidents and to consider their safety during Ramadan. Finsbury Park, in the London Borough of Islington, is a bustling, diverse area of north London with a strong Muslim community. On May 22, a suicide attack killed 22 people and injured nearly 60 after an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester. The attacker was motivated by Islamist extremism, police said. The London Bridge attack was on June 3. That attack also appeared inspired by Islamist extremism.  The head of Tell MAMA, Fiyaz Mughal, warned of reprisal attacks against Muslims after major Islamist terrorist incidents.  We saw that very clearly after Manchester, a very high peak. We saw that clearly after London Bridge, he said."

Brexit negotiations begin despite Theresa May facing growing revolt over Hard Brexit plans,Business Insider,Adam Bienkov,6/19/2017,"LONDON     Brexit negotiations will begin on Monday   morning despite a widening Cabinet rift over Britains   negotiating aims and growing doubts about the future of prime   minister Theresa May.     Brexit Minister David Davis will this morning meet with chief EU   negotiator Michel Barnier in Brussels for the first day of   what he described as historic talks that will set Britain on   the road to leaving the EU.     Today marks the start of negotiations that will shape the future   of the European Union and the United Kingdom, and the lives of   our citizens, he is expected to say.        While there is a long road ahead, our destination is clear     a   deep and special partnership between the UK and the EU. A deal   like no other in history.     The early stages of the talks are expected to focus   on Britains divorce from the EU, the future of   EU citizens living in the UK, and the Northern Ireland border.   Talks on Britains future relationship with the bloc are to   be held back until later in the year.     The negotiations begin despite May yet failing to have agreed a   deal with the DUP to support her governments Queens Speech next   week. It also comes as May faces open criticism from senior   Cabinet members about her failed election campaign and growing   pressure to drop her plans for a Hard Brexit, which would see   Britain leave the EU Single Market and Customs Union.     Both Davis and May remain committed to plans to crash out of the   EU if no deal is secured in two years, saying that no deal is   better than a bad deal.     Mays foreign secretary Boris Johnson has insisted   previously that such an outcome would be perfectly ok.     However,  to the government   pleading with it to soften its approach and put the economy   first in talks.     The letter from the British Chambers of Commerce, Confederation   of British Industry, EEF, Federation of Small Businesses, and   Institute of Directors, calls on the government to accept   continued membership of the Single Market and Customs union until   any new trade deal is signed and implemented     a process that   trade  experts suggest could take up to a decade.     A poll on Sunday also found . Survation found   that a majority of voters back staying in the Customs Union and   holding a second referendum on the final deal May secures   with the EU.     May  faces civil war inside her Cabinet, over whether   she should continue with her hardline position on Brexit. Senior   members are believed to want May to ditch her     negotiating stance. However, other senior figures have threatened   to force a vote of no confidence in her leadership if the   plans are watered down.     Mays chancellor Philip Hammond became the first    distanced himself from Mays hardline position yesterday,   saying that crashing out of the EU without a deal would be very,   very bad for Britain.     In a scathing attack on Mays failed election   campaign, Hammond also told the Andrew Marr Show that he had   been prevented from selling the governments record on the   economy.     It was a mistake for the campaign not to focus more on an area   where we have a great story to tell     our record on the economy,   he said. I think it was a mistake that we didnt spend more time   and resources taking apart Jeremy Corbyns economic proposals and   his spending plans, which are frankly incredible and would do   enormous damage to this country, to our jobs, to our economy. I   think that was a mistake.     May has been told she has just over a week to recover her   position, or face a leadership challenge, according to a report   in the Sunday Times.

But, yeah, I mean, he lives three blocks away from the district. ) Brent Scher, an intrepid reporter for the Washington Free Beacon, put that Ossoff campaign claim to the test on Monday, and discovered that the actual distance from Ossoffs residence to the Sixth Congressional District is three miles rather than three blocks: I set out to walk from Ossoffs current residence in the northwest corner of Emory University to a section of the sixth district (outlined in green in the below screenshot) that juts down into the fifth district on Buford Highway. It would have been a shorter trip, by the way, to Georgias Fourth Congressional District, but thats not where Ossoff is running. I drew myself my own little map, knowing that my phone would be taxed by my attempt to put the entire quest on Facebook Live, and set out at 10:32 a. m. for the International Cafe, which I determined to be the closest landmark inside the sixth district. I documented the early parts of my journey in the above video, but eventually the treacherous conditions of the long walk were too much for my Motorola Droid Turbo to handle. Shortly after my attempts to Facebook Live crashed and burned, my entire phone followed suit. Scher says he arrived at the International Cafe, the closest landmark inside the sixth district, after walking for about two hours. He took an Uber back to where he had parked his car to begin his walk. My Uber from the International Cafe back to my car, which was parked by Ossoffs place, was 6. 55 miles and took 18 minutes and 45 seconds. My walk was about 3. 2 miles, Scher wrote. A lot longer than 3 blocks, Scher concluded. The outcome of Tuesdays election between Ossoff and Karen Handel, the Republican candidate, remains too close to call."
Dont tell me what Im trying to do: Fox News anchor clashes with Trump attorney in fiery interview over investigation,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/19/2017,"Fox News anchor Chris Wallace grilled an attorney for President   Donald Trump over the Russia investigation and the   presidents  for potential obstruction of   justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey.     In a heated interview on Fox News Sunday, Trump attorney Jay   Sekulow insisted          that the   president was not under criminal investigation, despite reporting   from The Washington Post and the presidents own tweet that   suggested he was a target of the investigation.     The interview became lively when Sekulow seemed to   contradict himself, suggesting that Trump was under   investigation after firing Comey on the recommendations   of the attorney general and deputy attorney general.     He takes the action that they also, by the way, recommended. And   now hes being investigated by the Department of Justice,   Sekulow said. So hes being investigated for taking the action   the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him   to take by the agency that recommended the determination.     Youve now said that hes being investigated, Wallace said.      No, Chris. Let me be crystal clear so you completely understand:   We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the   president of the United States, Sekulow replied.     Sir, youve just said two times that hes being investigated,   Wallace said.     hat an agency told him to take. That is protected   under the constitution.     When Wallace said Sekulow did not appear to know whether Trump is   under investigation for obstruction of justice, Sekulow   sarcastically suggested that he had not been informed that   special prosecutor Robert Mueller was investigating the   president.     Youre right, Chris, I cant read the mind of the special   prosecutor, but I have not been notified, no one has been   notified that he is, Sekulow said.     After the Fox News anchor pressed Sekulow over whether Trump was   going to fire deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and Mueller,   Sekulow attempted to end the line of questioning.     Heres what youre trying to do, Chris, Sekulow said.     Now youre reading minds again, Wallace said.     No, Chris, I deal with fact and law, Sekulow said. Youre   asking me to read peoples minds.     Well then, dont tell me what Im trying to do, because you   dont know what Im trying to do, Wallace replied. Actually,   what Im trying to get is a straight answer out of you.

Megyn Kelly Gets Middling Reviews for Alex Jones Profile - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ezra Dulis,6/19/2017,"Establishment news outlets reviewing Megyn Kellys controversial interview with radio host and Infowars publisher Alex Jones have mostly panned the NBC News host for a shallow profile that spends more time trying to justify itself than revealing anything interesting to her audience. [A handful of TV critics offered faint praise for Kellys performance, with most saying she avoided disaster or the   scenario.  However, the majority faulted the   ratings grab for being far less compelling than its subject warranted.  Megyn Kelly is getting crushed in the big leagues and its beginning to show, wrote Don Kaplan at the New York Daily News. Sure, she looked tough as she grilled Jones, but Kelly delivered no news. She did not move the story of this monster forward, nor provide anything aside from a shallow profile.  Will Oremus of Slate wrote: in her determination to avoid normalizing Jones, Kelly also avoided drawing anything particularly interesting out of him or the phenomenon he represents       Ultimately, the segment came off less as a   work of journalism than an apologia for its own existence.  Sonia Saraiya of Variety called the segment empty and the interview with Jones stilted.  The content, she wrote, was much less interesting than the conversation that led up to the broadcast       For all the   the segment ultimately revealed more about Kellys weaknesses as an anchor in the 60 Minutes mold than it did about Jones.  Ultimately, the segment covered all the right bases, albeit frustratingly briefly, said Frank Scheck of the Hollywood Reporter. But it needed to be far more  .  Lorraine Ali of the Los Angeles Times: Kelly responded to the criticisms, saying she felt it was important to shine a light on Jones. But come Sunday, that light was a dim bulb at best.  Ali called a supplemental interview with the father of a Sandy Hook victim a cynical attempt for NBC and Kelly to appear as if they were offering up a real news story rather than a   ratings grab.  Hank Stuever of the Washington Post was more forgiving, calling the news package far from dreadful.  However, he did not let Megyn herself off unscathed: Kelly, who has many miles to go before she finds her footing as a   newsmagazine anchor, can and has done worse.  Cleveland. coms Joey Morona said the interview was pointed and challenging at times but wreaked [sic] with the unavoidable stench of damage control.  Madeline Berg of Forbes declared that Kelly managed to succeed with a challenging interview, though she chalked up at least some of the success to excessive editing: Even if it was due to editing   which was clearly very heavy, as Jones spoke in only frustratingly brief soundbites   Kellys segment was not the softball journalism that many feared.  Jeff Guo of Vox called Kellys effort a failure of journalism, but not a complete disaster.  He lamented that the   phone call audio that Jones leaked was far more illuminating than what aired on Sunday night.  CNNs Brian Lowry ruled that the piece that aired Sunday credibly justified covering the Infowars phenomenon, but he advised NBC and Kelly to avoid any more controversy for the rest of the shows summer run. Politicos Jack Shafer delivered some real praise for the segment: Megyn Kelly Pantses Alex Jones, his headline read. Short of waterboarding him, I dont know what more Kelly could have done to expose Jones dark methods, he wrote. She was needlessly defensive in her presentation       She didnt take Jones down, but really, who could have in a newsmagazine segment? But she did do a credible job of exposing his lies. Give her a B+.  The reviews do confirm that Kellys promises to Jones before their   interview were false. Its not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that, she said, stressing that the aim of the profile would be humanizing Jones for his critics: All I can do is give you my word and tell you     if theres one thing about me, I do what I say Im gonna do. And I     I dont double cross, so I promise you when its over youll say, Absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do.  And youll be fine with it. Im not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or, you know, do any sort of a gotcha moment. I just want to talk about you. I want people to get to know you. And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, You know what? I see, like, the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than Ive been led to believe.

He claims that he recorded the full,   exchange with Kelly     and has challenged NBC News to release its full, unedited interview     before he does! Kellys ratings gamble failed to pay off, even with a controversial guest like Jones. Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly grabbed fewer viewers than reruns of CBSs 60 Minutes and ABCs Americas Funniest Home Videos, according to the Hollywood Reporter."
Delingpole: Trump Is Western Democracys Last Man Standing Against the Green Terror,Breitbart,James Delingpole,6/19/2017,"Donald Trump is the only leader left in the world defending Western democracy against eco fascism. [Dont just take it from me. Read this Belgian philosopher, Drieu Godefridi, interviewed in the French liberal newspaper Contrepoints and translated here by Friends of Science Calgary.  He believes that the Paris climate agreement was a global socialist plot which the U. S. was absolutely right to escape: [President Trump] perfectly grasped the essence of the Paris Agreement, which is to redistribute the wealth of the West to the rest of the world     he expressly declared it on the Lawn of the White House, on June 1st, 2017 when making the American exit from Paris official. In so doing, he has stopped the formidable internationalist socialist machinery that was in the process of being set up. In other words, he has refused to validate the   moral intuition, and the scientific pretext that gave birth to the Paris Agreement. Environmentalism, argues Godefridi, is just another facet of the lefts ongoing war against democracy: What we have been seeing for the past two decades, in the areas of climate, gender theory, immigration and terrorism, and so on, is that activist minority ideologues have confiscated democratic debate. What makes it so especially dangerous is that unlike, say, gender theory     which everyone knows to be   leftist nonsense     climate change has a superficial scientific plausibility capable of fooling people who ought to know better. But really, its just another mask for globalism. Climate is something else! Every time since its birth in the fold of the IPCC, the ideology of the climate has claimed science as its foundational authority     and science in its most precise version! Physics! The politicized IPCC has never stopped claiming it is presenting science since. So, it is this second globalization, a prelude to a world government that is openly called for by the elites of internationalist socialism, which is threatened today by the American exit of the Paris Agreement. By quitting Paris, Trump hasnt merely saved the U. S. an awful lot of money. He also saved the democratic values which the previous administration was half way towards destroying. Under the aegis of the previous occupants of the White House, America itself, traditionally more resistant to socialism than the Europeans, has already largely embarked on this path. Therefore, from this point of view, the American break from the   bank heist, deserves to be described as a       as a return to the roots of American democracy and the wisdom of its founding fathers. Nope, Id never heard of Godefridi either till this interview. But he is now officially my fourth favorite Belgian, after Tintin, Jacques Brel and Plastic Bertrand"

[Obeidallah, a former attorney and   comedian, was asked about what the media can to do   the animosity in society. He answered:  You see it on Fox News, you see on the Breitbarts out there, really demonizing Muslims, portraying us as threats to America. You have people in the White House now like Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. You had Michael Flynn     who is no longer part of the administration, who was on the board of directors for ACT for America, a group the Southern Poverty Law Center calls the biggest   group in America. You have Mike Pompeo, the CIA director, got an award last year from ACT for America. So you have a direct line from the White House to   bigotry. I really hope as a nation we can take a step back and stop   hate. We saw a horrific attack this week on a member of Congress. Other members of Congress could have been hurt. Its part and parcel of the same thing. Its demonizing, ginning up fear, irrationally ginning up fear, and people responding in the worst way possible. So, Im concerned. Last year, Obeidallah falsely blamed a   activist for a    attack against a Muslim woman in Belgium. When confronted about his error, he tweeted: go f*ck urself.  On Sunday evening, he took to Twitter to defend his commentary on CNN against someone who complained: look a trump supporter wants me off tv because I dared give facts that linked TRump and his admin with   bigotry https:  .

In an essay on CNN, he argued that Trump supporters were hypocrites for criticizing a production of Julius Caesar in New York Citys Central Park that featured a President Trump lookalike being assassinated, because past productions elsewhere featured Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton lookalikes in the title role.

EXCLUSIVE: Inside Venezuela: Starved Families Scavenge for Food in Garbage-Covered Streets - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/19/2017,"CARACAS, Venezuela     Driving through the streets of Caracas, it is impossible not to notice the ubiquitous government propaganda on the sides of buildings and scores of armed police. [Even harder to avoid, however, is the garbage.  On almost every street corner, stacks of waste can be seen piled up, some of it in black bags, but other items in limbo such as water bottles, diapers and occasionally food waste. Around almost every pile of garbage, a crowd had formed, rifling through it for scraps to eat. From schoolchildren to the elderly, even to those in work uniform, many Venezuelans are resorting to scavaging just to survive. A recent report found that over 15 percent of people scavenge as a means of survival. Those who eat what they find have developed the skill of finding edible bits of food where they can. In an interview with Colombias El Tiempo, for example, one woman noted that some neighborhoods are known for having the good garbage     the kind with food in it that can be recooked and consumed, as opposed to   waste.  A woman and her teenage daughter, who can be seen wearing a school backpack, search for food in garbage bags.   Huge amounts of waste are routinely dumped on roadsides. A     scolds me for taking the photo. Anything showing Venezuelas extreme poverty is considered a crime against the state.    men ruffle through bin bags. Drainage systems are also inundated with waste, increasing the risk of flooding.  A roadside is covered in waste within a busy market.  Stray dogs can be seen scavenging through garbage. Some Venezuelans have now resorted to eating dogs just to survive.    protesters regularly place bin bags in the middle of the road to prevent vehicles from accessing marches.  I AM HUNGRY The countrys problems with managing landfill are well documented. Venezuelas waste management system has been largely   for much of the Chavista era. In 2007, a Lonely Planet travel guide to Venezuela warned foreign visitors that waste management was far and away the most obvious environmental problem in Venezuela, with no recycling policy and dumping of garbage in cities, along roads and natural areas is common practice.  In some neighborhoods, garbage trucks simply fail to come around for over a week, resulting in large heaps of garbage on the streets. The fundamental problem has been planning, which has stagnated the solid wage management systems [in Venezuela] for 20 years, because in the past two decades, the exact same thing has been done despite the evolution of technology as well as recycling measures that have evolved, Universidad Central de Venezuela (UCV) professor Juan Carlos Snchez explained at a 2016 presentation. There is little evidence that Maduro has implemented reforms to change the waste management system, despite his claims of environmentalism. Venezuela remains a signatory of the Paris Climate Agreement and under former president, Hugo Chvezs leadership launched a number of environmental initiatives such as Mission Tree that promoted conservation and sustainable development. However, such initiatives appear to have been sidelined under the Maduro regime, and it is unclear how, if at all, Venezuela is working to meet the commitments in the Paris agreement. This did not stop Maduro from criticizing President Donald Trumps withdrawal announcement from the Paris Agreement, accusing Trump of turning his back on the world.  Maduro has blamed corruption, private enterprise, and the United States generally for the countrys current state of emergency. In addition to the unsightly nature of the problem and environmental dangers, the waste is also likely to present a serious health hazard, particular given the South American nations status as one of the countries most affected by the Zika virus. Stagnant pools of water, easily created by standing waste after rainfall, breed mosquitos that spread the disease. The government has refused to disclose numbers of Zika victims or other key details to keeping the public safe, and the Colombian Health Minister last year accusing Venezuelan health officials of an epidemiological silence on the problem. Even if Venezuelan government officials sought to solve the problem now, they would have to improvise on what to use to solve it. Venezuela is lacking hygienic products to tackle the mess, with chronic shortages of products such as detergent, disinfectants, and general cleaning materials.

I understand that this will be extremely concerning for the residents of Kidderminster but I would like to reassure you that at this time we believe the suspect was acting alone and we are not looking for anyone else in connection with the incident. At this stage, we do not believe this incident is linked to the tragic events in Finsbury Park in London. I would urge people not to speculate on what has happened. As I am sure you will appreciate, this is an extremely sensitive investigation but I can assure you that we will make information available as and when it is appropriate. In the meantime, we will have additional officers on patrol in Kidderminster to provide reassurance to our communities. Our advice to residents remains the same as before remain alert but not alarmed and to report any suspicious activity to the police by calling the confidential   hotline on 0800 789321.

Rift Between Officers and Residents as Killings Persist in South Bronx - The New York Times,New York Times,Benjamin Mueller and Al Baker,6/19/2017,"After the bullet shells get counted, the blood dries and the votive candles burn out, people peer down from   windows and see crime scenes gone cold: a band of yellow police tape blowing in the breeze. The South Bronx, just across the Harlem River from Manhattan and once shorthand for urban dysfunction, still suffers violence at levels long ago slashed in many other parts of New York City. And yet the citys efforts to fight it remain splintered, underfunded and burdened by scandal. In the 40th Precinct, at the southern tip of the Bronx, as in other poor, minority neighborhoods across the country, people long hounded for   infractions are crying out for more protection against grievous injury or death. By September, four of every five shootings in the precinct this year were unsolved. Out of the citys 77 precincts, the 40th has the highest murder rate but the fewest detectives per violent crime, reflecting disparities in staffing that hit hardest in some neighborhoods outside Manhattan, according to a New York Times analysis of Police Department data. Investigators in the precinct are saddled with twice the number of cases the department recommends, even as their bosses are called to Police Headquarters to answer for the sharpest crime rise in the city this year. And across the Bronx, investigative resources are squeezed. It has the highest   rate of the citys five boroughs but the thinnest detective staffing. Nine of the 14   precinct detective squads for violent crime in the city are there. The boroughs robbery squad is smaller than Manhattans, even though the Bronx has had 1, 300 more cases this year. And its homicide squad has one detective for every four murders, compared with one detective for roughly every two murders in Upper Manhattan and more than one detective per murder in Lower Manhattan. In   lobbies and   family apartments, outside methadone clinics and art studios, people take note of the inequity. They hear police commanders explain that they lack the resources to place a floodlight on a dangerous block or to post officers at a   corner. They watch witnesses cower behind   doors, more fearful of a gunmans crew than confident in the Police Departments ability to protect them. So though people see a lot, they rarely testify. And in the South Bronx, as in so many predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods like it in the United States, the contract between the police and the community is in tatters. Some people have stories of crime reports that were ignored, or 911 calls that went unanswered for hours. Others tell of a 911 call for help ending in the callers arrest, or of a minor charge leading to 12 hours in a fetid holding cell. This is the paradox of policing in the 40th Precinct. Its neighborhoods have historically been prime targets for aggressive tactics, like    that are designed to ward off disorder. But precinct detectives there have less time than anywhere else in the city to answer for the blood spilled in violent crimes. Gola White, who was beside her daughter when she was shot and killed in a playground this summer, four years after her son was gunned down in the same housing project, ticked off the public safety resources that she said were scant in Bronx neighborhoods like hers: security cameras, lights, locks, investigating police officers. Here, we have nothing, she said. When it comes to   families, she said, the authorities dont really care as much. Thats how I feel.  The Times has been documenting the murders logged this year in the 40th Precinct, one of a handful of neighborhoods where deadly violence remains a problem in an era of   crime in New York City. The homicides     14 in the precinct this year, up from nine in 2015     strain detectives, and when they go unsolved, as half of them have this year, some look to take the law into their own hands. From hundreds of conversations with grieving relatives and friends, witnesses and police officers, the social forces that flare into murder in a place like the 40th Precinct become clearer: merciless gang codes, mental illness, drugs and long memories of feuds that simmered out of officers view. The reasons some murders will never be solved also emerge: paralyzing fear of retribution, victims carrying secrets to their graves and relentless casework that forces detectives to move on in hopes that a break will come later. Frustrations build on all sides. Detectives phones rarely ring with tips, and officers grow embittered with witnesses who will not cooperate. In the meantime, a victims friends conduct their own investigations, and talk of grabbing a stash gun from a wheel well or a mothers apartment when they find their suspect. In the chasm between the police and the community, gangs and gun violence flourish. Parents try to protect their families from drug crews threats, and officers work to overcome the residue of years of mistrust and understaffing in communities where they still go racing from one 911 call to the next. The streets around St. Marys Park were the scene of two fatal shootings logged in the 40th Precinct this year. Both are unsolved. James Fernandez heard talk of the murders through the door of his   apartment on East 146th Street in a     the Betances Houses. He lived at the end of a long hallway strewn with hypodermic needles, empty dope bags and discarded Hennessy bottles. A   young men who spoke of being in a subset of the Bloods gang had made it their drug market, slinging marijuana and cocaine to regulars, flashing firearms and blowing smoke into the Fernandez apartment. When Mr. Fernandez, 40, asked the young men to move, they answered by busting up his car. This kind of crime, an anachronism in much of New York, still rattles the 40th Precinct, even though murders there have fallen to 14 this year from 83 in 1991. It has more major felony crimes per resident than any other residential district in the city. It is also one of the poorest communities in the country, and many young men find their way into underground markets. Mr. Fernandez was not one to shrink from the threats. When he was growing up on the Lower East Side, he rode his bicycle around to the customers of the drug dealers he worked for and collected payments in a backpack. After leaving that life, he got a tech maintenance job and, three years ago, moved into the Betances Houses with his wife and daughter, now 11. He had two choices to get help with the drug crew: call the police for help and risk being labeled a snitch, or call his old Lower East Side bosses for muscle and risk violence. He chose the police. Again and again, he walked into a local substation, Police Service Area 7, and asked for protection. His daughter was using an inhaler to relieve coughs from the marijuana smoke. Mr. Fernandez and his wife got terrible headaches. Theres a lot of killers here, and we are going to kill you, a sergeants police report quoted a    telling Mr. Fernandez in August 2015. A second report filed the same day said a    warned him, Im going to shoot through your window.  Mr. Fernandez told the police both the teenagers names, which appear in the reports, and then went home. He said one of their friends had seen him walk into the substation, and they tried to intimidate him out of filing another report. Three days later, the same    propped his bike on their door, then said if I was to open the door and say something, they would body slam me, Mr. Fernandezs wife, Maria Fernandez, wrote on slips of paper she used to document the hallway ruckus and the inadequate police response. The boys made comments about how easy a target she was and about how they would have to slap her if she opened the door while they made a drug sale, and they threatened to beat the Fernandez family because they are the ones snitching, her notes say. But another   complaint at the substation, 10 days after the first, brought no relief. A week later, feeling desperate, Ms. Fernandez tried calling: first to the substation, at 8:50 p. m. when one of the boys blew weed smoke at her door and made a   threat to attack her, and then to 911 at 10:36 p. m. The police never came, she wrote in her notes. She tried the 40th Precinct station house next, but officers at the desk left her standing in the public waiting area for a   she said, making her fear being seen again. Officers put her in worse danger some months later, she said, when they came to her door and announced in front of the teenagers that they were there on a complaint about drug activity. Mr. Fernandez started doing the work that he said the police had failed to do. He wired a camera into his peephole to record the drugs and guns. The footage hark back to the New York of the 1980s, still very much present to some of the precincts residents. Around 6:30 each morning, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo walks through the tall wooden doors of the 40th Precinct station house. The cases that land on his metal desk     dead bodies with no known cause, strip club brawls, shooting victims hobbling into the hospital themselves     bring resistance at every turn, reminding him of an earlier era in the citys   campaign. I havent got one single phone call thats putting me in the right direction here, said Sergeant LoPuzzo, the head of the precincts detective squad, one day this summer as he worked on an answer to an email inquiry from a murder victims aunt about why the killer had not been caught. And people just dont understand that.  Often it is detectives who most feel the effects of people turning on the police. Witnesses shout them away from their doors just so neighbors know they refuse to talk. Of the 184 people who were shot and wounded in the Bronx through early September, more than a third     66 victims     refused to cooperate. Over the same period in the 40th Precinct, squad detectives closed three of 17 nonfatal shootings, and 72 of 343 robbery cases. Part of the resistance stems from   preventive policing tactics, like    that were a hallmark of the     style under former Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly. Near the height of the    strategy, in 2012, the 40th Precinct had the   stops in the city, the   stops in which officers used force and the most frisks. Of 18, 276 stops that year, 15, 521 were of people who had done nothing criminal. The precinct was also one of the   areas that the department flooded with its newest officers. At roll calls, they were pressured to generate numbers: write tickets and make arrests. They had no choice but to give a summons to a young man playing in a park after dark, even if the officers had done the same growing up in the same neighborhood. I need to bring something in today to justify my existence, Officer Argenis Rosado, who joined the precinct in 2010, said in an interview at the station house. So now youre in a small area, and day after day youre hammering the same community. Of course that communitys eventually going to turn on you.  The pressure warped the way officers and residents saw each other. Rookies had to ignore why someone might be drinking outside or sitting on a stoop. Some of the cops that came out at that time probably viewed the community differently, too, said Hector Espada, a   veteran of the precinct. Not because they wanted to, but because they had to. Because some way or somehow, you cant give someone a $115 summons and feel like you guys could still have a civil conversation after that.  Morale wilted in the aged station house on Alexander Avenue, in Mott Haven. Officers felt pressure to downgrade crime complaints to make them appear less serious. Several said in interviews that they had overlooked crime reports from immigrants because they were seen as unlikely to complain, and watched supervisors badger victims into repeating their stories in hopes that they would drop their complaints. The practice of downgrading complaints resulted in the disciplining of 19 officers in the precinct last year, one in a string of scandals that has left officers there feeling overscrutinized for problems that also existed elsewhere. Four commanders in the precinct were sent packing in five years, one of them after officers were found to be ticket fixing, or forgiving parking tickets for friends, and another after he was recorded giving guidance on whom to stop and frisk: black boys and men, ages 14 to 21. Some officers fled to other commands. Others became reluctant to take assignments in proactive policing units, like   that put them in   situations on the street. Whenever I walked through the doors of the precinct, to me, it seemed like a black cloud, said Russell Lewis, a    of the 40th. It was like a heaviness. When you walked in, all you wanted to do was do your 8 hours 35 minutes and go home, because you didnt want to get caught up in anything.  The precinct covers only about two square miles, but the more than a dozen housing projects there mean that it overflows with people. Methadone clinics draw addicts from around the city.   lofts on the southern edge of the precinct presage a wave of gentrification. Even as the Police Department has hired 1, 300 more officers for neighborhood policing and counterterrorism, officers in the 40th Precinct said they could still rush to 25 911 calls during a shift     a number unchanged from what the new police commissioner, James P. ONeill, said he was handling in a similar South Bronx precinct 15 years ago. Several dozen calls at a time can be waiting for a response. Residents know that if you want the police for a domestic problem, it helps to hint that there is a weapon. Last year, the precinct drew the   number of civilian complaints for officer misconduct in the city, and the most lawsuits stemming from police actions. The precinct is trying to improve morale under a new commanding officer, Deputy Inspector Brian Hennessy. A cadre of what the department calls neighborhood coordination officers has been on patrol since last January, part of a citywide effort under Mr. ONeill and Mayor Bill de Blasio to bring back the beat cop, unencumbered by chasing every last 911 call, who can listen to peoples concerns and help with investigations. The precinct has made among the most gun arrests in the city, and officers said they now had more discretion to resolve encounters without a summons or an arrest. At one corner near a school, on Courtlandt Avenue and East 151st Street, that has long spawned complaints about gunfire and fights, Inspector Hennessy and some of his officers painted over graffiti and swept up drug paraphernalia this summer. People said it was the first answer to their complaints in years. But the inspector acknowledged that the residue of   policing lingers. That perception really sticks, he said. The workload in the 40th Precinct is startling and reveals a gap in how detective squads are equipped to answer violent crime in Manhattan compared with the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens. Three of the precincts 16 detectives are carrying more than 400 cases each this year, and many others have loads in the high 300s, even though the department advises 150 in violent precincts. When they are assigned a homicide, they typically have four days to investigate before dealing with other cases. Quieter precincts can give detectives a month with little distraction to investigate a murder. Detectives in the 40th Precinct have each handled an average of 79 violent felonies this year through       murders, rapes, felony assaults and robberies. By contrast, a detective in the precinct on the southern end of Staten Island carries nine such cases a detective in the precinct patrolling Union Square and Gramercy Park handles 16 and a detective in the precinct for most of Washington Heights handles 32, the citywide median. Last year, the 40th was the    for violent crime, with 65 cases per detective. In the Bronx as a whole, a precinct detective has carried an average of 58 violent felonies this year, compared with 27 in Manhattan, 37 in Brooklyn, 38 in Queens and 25 on Staten Island. Rape cases and robbery patterns are later sent to more specialized units, but precinct detectives do extensive initial work to interview victims, write reports and process evidence. Precincts in much of Manhattan, which are whiter and wealthier than the South Bronx, often have more property felonies, like stolen laptops or credit cards, and the police say those can be complex. But even accounting for those crimes, the 40th Precinct has some of the heaviest caseloads of overall crime per detective in the city. Michael Palladino, the head of the Detectives Endowment Association and a former Bronx officer, said staffing disparities affected the departments efforts to build trust in communities like the South Bronx. Witnesses make a calculation, he said: If I cooperate with the detectives, theres so much work, theres so few of them there, they wont even get the chance to protect me, or theyll be there too late when the retaliation comes.  Sergeant LoPuzzo, who turned down a more prestigious post to stay in the 40th Precinct, said that his squad worked tirelessly to handle cases with the people he had, and that while every squad wanted more detectives, staffing needs for counterterrorism units and task forces had created new deployment challenges across the department. We fight with the army we have, not the army we wish we had, he said. Details of how the Police Department assigns its 36, 000 officers are closely held and constantly in flux, and the public has minimal information on how personnel are allocated. Presented with The Timess analysis of confidential staffing data, the departments chief of detectives, Robert K. Boyce, vowed to send more detectives to the 40th Precinct and said the department would reassess its deployment more broadly in troubled precincts. He said a recent decision to bring gang, narcotics and vice detectives under his command made it easier to shift personnel. Chief Boyce said the burdens on detectives went beyond felony crimes to include   and   cases. And he noted the support that precinct squads got from centralized units focusing on robberies, gangs or grand larcenies, for example. Major crime keeps pounding the 40th Precinct, at rates that in 2015 were only a tenth of a percent lower than in 2001, even as citywide crime dropped by more than a third over the same period. But the precincts detective squad shrank by about eight investigators during those years, according to staffing data obtained from the City Council through a Freedom of Information Law request. The squad covering Union Square and Gramercy Park, where crime dropped by a third over that period, grew by about 11 investigators. (The 40th Precinct was given an additional detective and four   investigators this summer, when it was already missing three detectives for illness or other reasons.) Retired detectives are skeptical that community relations alone can drive down crime in the citys last  the busiest precincts. Rather, they say, the Police Department should be dedicating more resources to providing the same sort of robust investigative response that seems standard in Manhattan. Any crime in Manhattan has to be solved, said Howard Landesberg, who was a 40th Precinct detective in the late 1980s. The outer boroughs are, like, forgotten.  Retired detectives said that understaffing made it harder to solve crimes in the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, where the higher prevalence of gang and drug killings already saddled investigators with cases in which people were not inclined to cooperate. Through   detectives had closed 67 percent of homicides in Manhattan and 76 percent of those in Staten Island this year, compared with 54 percent of those in the Bronx, 42 percent of those in Queens and 31 percent of those in Brooklyn. Of last years homicides, detectives cleared 71 percent in Manhattan, 63 percent in the Bronx, 62 percent in Queens, 57 percent in Staten Island and 31 percent in Brooklyn. Its the culture of the Police Department that they worry about Manhattan, said Joseph L. Giacalone, a former sergeant in the Bronx Cold Case Squad, in part because thats where the money is.  He added: When de Blasio came in, he talked about the tale of two cities. And then hes done the complete opposite of what he said. Its just business as usual.  The Bronxs struggles extend into prosecutions. In each of the last five years, prosecutors in the Bronx have declined to prosecute violent felony cases more than anywhere else in the city. And the rate of conviction in the Bronx is routinely the lowest in the city as well, but has ticked up this year to surpass Brooklyns rate through November as Bronx prosecutors work to streamline cases. Some cases have become even more difficult to win because of the   problem in the 40th Precinct, which has allowed defense lawyers to attack the credibility of officers who were implicated, said Patrice OShaughnessy, a spokeswoman for the Bronx District Attorneys office. The district attorney, Darcel D. Clark, elected in 2015, said in a statement, I was a judge here in the Bronx, and I heard from jurors that they cant be impartial because they dont trust the police.  Against that tide of mistrust, Sergeant LoPuzzos detectives work 36 hours straight on some fresh cases. They buy Chinese takeout with their own money for a murder suspect. They carry surveillance videos home in hopes that their personal computers may enhance them better than a squad computer. They buy an urn for a homeless mother who has her murdered sons ashes in a box. In the months after a killing, they can seem like the only people in this glittering city who are paying attention to the 40th Precincts homicide victims. Newly fatherless children go back to school without a therapists help. Victims families wander confused through a courthouse and nearly miss an appearance. Newspapers largely ignore killings of people with criminal pasts, pushing them down the priority lists of the   chiefs at Police Headquarters. In a stuffy   squad room, the detectives of the 40th Precinct grapple with an inheritance of government neglect. They meet mothers who believe their sons might never have been murdered had a city guidance counselor listened to pleas to help them stay enrolled, or had a city housing worker fixed the locks or lights on a building. And the detectives work alongside a vicious system on the streets for punishing police cooperators. Young men scan court paperwork in prison, looking for the names of people who turned on them. One murder victim in the precinct this year was cast out of his crew after he avoided being arrested with them in a gang takedown some believed he was cooperating. A longtime 40th Precinct detective, Jeff Meenagh, said a witness in a homicide case was going to testify until he went back to his neighborhood and was told that anyone who testified would get what you deserve.  The allies Sergeant LoPuzzo makes are friendly only for so long. He helped clear a womans son of a robbery charge by locating surveillance video that proved he was not the robber. The mother started calling with tips under a code name     about a gun under a car, for example. But she always refused to testify. And she cut ties this year after Sergeant LoPuzzo arrested her son in the stabbing of two people and her   in a shooting. New York City owns East 146th Street and the   buildings on each side. But James Fernandez, in the Betances Houses, said the reality on the ground was different: The drug boss ran the block. By October, Mr. Fernandez was increasingly afraid     and fed up. Mr. Fernandez and his wife went so far as to give officers keys to the building door, so they could get in whenever they wanted, showed them the videos and offered them   access to his camera so they could see what was happening in the hallway. A couple of officers said they needed a supervisors permission to do more. Others answered that the young men were only making threats. Officers occasionally stopped outside their building, causing the young men to scatter, but did not come inside, Mr. Fernandez said. The menacing worsened. Mr. Fernandezs daughter was harassed as she arrived home from school. She grew more and more distressed, and her parents had her start seeing a therapist. Mr. Fernandez made several complaints at the office of the borough president, Ruben Diaz Jr. and visited a victims advocate in the district attorneys office. On Oct. 20, 2015, he sent an online note to the police commissioners office. We went to all proper channels for help, the note said. Both precincts failed us, except 2 officers who helped us, but their hands are tied. No one else to turn to. I have months of video of multiple crimes taking place and we are in extreme danger.  40th and PSA 7 wont do anything, he wrote, referring to the local substation. Please we need to speak to some one with authority.  The local substation commander, Deputy Inspector Jerry OSullivan, and the Bronx narcotics unit were alerted to the complaints. But Mr. Fernandez said he never heard from them. So he relied on his own street instincts to protect his family. He made pleas to a man he thought was employing the dealers in the hallway. The activity quieted briefly, but it returned after the young men rented a room in a womans apartment upstairs. Mr. Fernandez approached a different man who he learned was the boss of the operation. The man agreed to ask the dealers to calm down. He even hired a drug customer to sweep the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said. But two weeks later, the dealing and the harassment resumed. So he went to his old Lower East Side bosses, who hired men to trail his wife and daughter on their way out of the building and make sure they made it safely to school. At other times they sat outside the Betances Houses. He also bought two bulletproof vests, for about $700 each. He could not find one small enough for his daughter. I have no faith in the City of New York, I have no faith in the police, I have no faith in the politicians, Mr. Fernandez said. The only thing I know for sure: God, if were in a situation again, I will be left to defend my family.  Paying such close attention to what was happening in the hallway, Mr. Fernandez said he learned some details about two recent homicides that the 40th Precinct was investigating. But because his calls for help were going nowhere, he said he decided not to put himself in greater risk by talking: He would not tell the police what he had learned. Im bending over backward, and nobodys not even doing anything, he said. Why am I going to help you, if you aint going to help me? By last January, a new neighborhood coordination officer was working with residents of the Betances Houses, and ended up with the most arrests in his housing command, Inspector OSullivan said. Chief Boyce said that the silos in which gang and narcotics detectives used to work made responding to complaints more difficult, but that the recent restructuring would remove those obstacles. No one should live like Mr. Fernandez lived, with people dealing drugs outside of his apartment, he said. Mr. Fernandezs complaints did not spur any arrests, but two men from the hallway were caught separately this year in shootings. One of them, whom Mr. Fernandez named in a police report, was charged this summer with hitting an officer with a metal folding chair and firing three gunshots into a crowd, court papers say. He is being held on Rikers Island on an attempted murder charge. That was too late for Mr. Fernandez. By May, he had moved his family away."

Woman Sues Casino for Giving Her a Steak Dinner Instead of a $43 Million Jackpot - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/19/2017,"A woman is suing a casino after a slot machine told her she won a $43 million jackpot, but the casino claimed it was an error and offered her a free steak dinner instead. [Katrina Bookman played the Sphinx Slot Machine at Resorts World Casino in Queens, New York in August 2016 when the screen popped up saying that she won $42, 949, 672. 76, the New York Daily News reported.  Bookman, excited thinking she won a great prize, took a selfie with the screen in the background. When she went to collect her prize, however, a casino worker told her a different story. The worker told her that she did not win the jackpot, but offered her a complimentary steak dinner and $2.  the prize the casino claims she won. Alan Ripka, a lawyer for Bookman, said she did not take the casino workers offer. Instead, Bookman filed a lawsuit against the casino Wednesday in Queens County Supreme Court. You cant claim a machine is broken because you want it to be broken. Does that mean it wasnt inspected? Does it mean it wasnt maintained? , Ripka told CNN Money. And if so, does that mean that people that played there before [Bookman] had zero chance of winning? Ripka is seeking at least $43 million in damages, the amount Bookman claims she won, from the casino for causing his client mental anguish and setting her back financially as a result of not being able to collect her prize. The complaint says the casino was negligent in failing to maintain the machine and names Genting New York LLC, Resorts World Casinos parent company, as well as slot machine manufacturer International Game Technology as  . Dan Bank, a Resorts World spokesman, apologized in August and said: Casino personnel were able to determine that the figure displayed on the penny slot was the result of an obvious malfunction     a fact later confirmed by the New York State Gaming Commission.  The New York State Gaming Commission released a statement in August claiming that a disclaimer stating malfunctions void all pays and plays was posted on the machine at the time. The Iowa Supreme Court ruled in favor of Isle Casino Hotel in a similar court case in 2015 where the slot machine told a    woman she won $41 million, the Chicago Tribune reported. The court claimed that the games rules capped jackpots at $10, 000 and didnt allow bonuses."
University of Georgia Socialist Group Under Police Investigation After Calling for Beheading Republicans - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/19/2017,"A student group at the University of Georgia is facing a police investigation after saying on Twitter that Republicans should be guillotined. [Responding to a story about a professor at the Art Institute of Washington who allegedly claimed that House Republicans should be lined up and shot, the Young Democratic Socialists at the University of Georgia reportedly tweeted that the Republican members of the House should instead be guillotined.      David Littmann, the founder of the Young Democratic Socialists chapter at the University of Georgia who graduated in 2016, claimed that the tweet was made in jest. I wouldnt have made that joke myself, but it is clearly and obviously facetious, Littmann said. As a strict pacifist, I believe that all violence is immoral, period. But its absurd to take the joke literally.  The University of Georgia announced on their official Twitter account that the campus police department is investigating the matter.

Was this just mis-tweeted?: Anchors confront Trump lawyer who insists the president is not under investigation,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/19/2017,"A prominent member of President Donald Trumps legal team on   Sunday denied that the president is under criminal investigation   for obstruction of justice over his firing of former FBI Director   James Comey, directly contradicting a blockbuster Washington Post   report that said the president is now a target of the   investigation.     In  on Meet The Press, Jay Sekulow repeatedly   denied that Trump was the subject of special counsel Robert   Muellers criminal probe into Russias meddling in the 2016   election, even when host Chuck Todd pointed out that  seemed to confirm that he was a   target of the investigation.     Then why did he say he was? Todd asked. I mean, was this just    ? Are we not to take him at his word?     Sekulow insisted that Todd was reading more to the tweet than   whats there.     The presidents tweet was in response to Sekulow replied. The Washington   Post issued a story that had five anonymous sources, which they   never identified what agencies those sources originated out of.   The response from the president, using social media, was about   that story. But let me be very clear here, as it has been since   the beginning, the president is not and has not been under   investigation for obstruction.     tttI am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunttt    When Sekulow insisted that Trump fired Comey at the   recommendation of the deputy attorney general, Todd noted ;that   Trump himself told NBC anchor Lester Holt he planned on firing   Comey regardless of the deputy attorney general and the attorney   generals recommendation.     The question is going to be though, what was the reason behind   the firing? Todd asked. Was the reason having to do with his   handling of the Russia investigation, or was it having to do with   his handling of the Clinton email investigation? The reason I ask   you this is the memo that was written, the rationale by the   deputy attorney general, did not discuss Russia. The president,   in his interview with my colleague Lester Holt, said it was about   Russia. Which is it?     Sekulow insisted that Trump fired Comey over his handling of the   investigation into Hillary Clintons use of a private email   server when she was secretary of state     for which she was not   charged  and pointed out that Trump told Holt that firing   Comey would likely lengthen the investigation.     He was fully aware that if, in fact, he took this action, he   would see a lengthening or could see a lengthening of the   process, Sekulow said. So you cannot view this, in my mind,   Chuck, or in any reasonable persons mind, especially someone   thats representing the president of the United States, these   things in a vacuum. Theres multiple factors that come into   exist. But let me tell you the factor that came into exist here.   The president made the determination to remove the director of   the FBI after consultation with others. And that determination is   protected by the constitution.     Todd continued to push Sekulow, asking before the interview   closed why Trump seemed obsessed with the investigation even   though he insisted he was innocent.        Why does the president seem, act as if he is so concerned about   this investigation if he did nothing wrong? Todd said. If this   investigation is going to find     and he knows he did nothing   wrong, then he shouldnt be afraid of this investigation. Its   being led by professionals, a guy like Robert Mueller who is not   a political guy, you know hes not a partisan guy. Im just   curious, why doesnt the president embrace this investigation if   hes innocent?   Because every day, The Washington Post and The New York Times   are utilizing supposed leaked information about supposed   investigations of the president of the United States, Sekulow   replied. So his legal team and the president responds.     Todd was one of many cable news personalities who clashed   with Trumps personal attorney over his insistence that the   Washington Posts report was inaccurate. Sekulow made similar   claims on CNN, Fox News, and CBS News.   noting   the presidents apparent confirmation of the investigation.     With all due respect, the president said I am being   investigated in a tweet, and people take his word on that,   Tapper said. But youre his attorney. Youre saying that the   president, when he said that, was not accurate.     It was 141 characters, Sekulow replied. Theres a limitation   on Twitter, as we all know. . .. The president issued that tweet,   that social media statement, based on a fake report, a report   with no documented sources, from the Washington Post.     ttt. to  : so the President said he was under investigation, even though he isnt?     tttNew on : Trump lawyer says President is not under investigation, despite tweets.

"A Bullet Misses Its Mark, and Then Takes a Fatal Detour - The New York Times",New York Times,Al Baker and James C. McKinley Jr.,6/19/2017,"A   of   lead exploded from the barrel of a   pistol at 1, 300 feet per second. The bullet sped toward    Carlos Vasquez, who ran just steps ahead of the gunman. But it missed its mark, just outside the Melrose Houses in the South Bronx, and kept whistling through the air. It sailed for 150 yards along East 154th Street, down the slope between Courtlandt and Elton Avenues, staying airborne as the ground fell away. Maribel Cavero, 45, was crossing the street at the base of that hill, unaware that a shot had been fired during a running fight between young men in the housing project. She had just delivered a carton of sugar substitute to her diabetic grandmother on East 154th Street and was on her way to pick up her    niece from school. The bullet slowed and tumbled as it dropped. Then, with the last of its fading energy, it tore into Ms. Cavero. Alejandro Almonte, 45, a   heard Ms. Cavero yelp and saw her fall. He later said he thought she must have had a seizure. He ran to where she lay, facedown, on the blacktop by a small cars bumper. She was dying, the bullet having pierced her heart at about 12:50 p. m. on Nov. 2, a sunny Wednesday. The slug passed through her chest and rolled to a stop under a Jeep parked near a   house at 426 East 154th Street. The bullet was strangely pristine, hardly deformed by its deadly work. As investigators began to piece together how the woman had been shot, Sgt. Michael J. LoPuzzo, the commander of the 40th Precinct detective squad, looked uphill, where the bullet had been fired, and downhill, where it had come to rest, and surveyed the maze of telephone poles, streetlights, wires, cars and trees in between. The bullet had improbably traveled nearly two city blocks to strike an unintended victim and log the precincts 14th     and final     homicide of 2016. It couldnt have hit a tree? he said, shaking his head. A light pole? A sign? It was grim news for detectives in the 40th Precinct, where The New York Times has been examining every homicide logged in 2016, a succession of   assassinations, gang killings, domestic murders and random slayings. Half the cases remained unsolved, and Sergeant LoPuzzos investigators were already struggling to find the person responsible for the fatal shooting of another innocent bystander, Jessica White, cut down on a playground in June. Now, less than a mile away and five months later, the police had another mystery and another blameless bystander lying crumpled on the ground. Detectives were initially unable to explain what had happened. The mayors office called the chief of detectives, and the chief of detectives called Sergeant LoPuzzo. The message was simple: Do all you can. The department flooded the streets with rookies who picked through trash and shined flashlights in alleyways and sewer grates searching for any potential evidence. Detectives checked Ms. Caveros background for clues. The head of Bronx detectives, Deputy Chief Jason Wilcox, stalked the streets between the projects and the businesses on Third Avenue, the area around him abuzz with the police. It was a striking show of force, and a marked escalation from the police response after Ms. White was killed as she tried to shield her children from gunfire. As the afternoon hours wore on, Sergeant LoPuzzo and his detectives started getting breaks. Things lined up in ways they seldom do in this part of the Bronx, where witnesses rarely agree to testify and investigative staffing is one of the lowest in the city despite a   rate that is the highest. By late the next night, Orlando Oquendo, a    who the police believed had fired the bullet, was in handcuffs, having been identified in a lineup by Mr. Vasquez, the man who said he was the target. Mr. Oquendo, who still looked very much a teenager, had been arrested several times, including twice on gun possession charges, according to court documents and his mother. That kid was on a road, Sergeant LoPuzzo said. It was just a matter of time.  Less than 48 hours elapsed from death to arrest, and what detectives in this corner of the city say they hope for but rarely see came to pass: The police and the people in the community had cooperated to solve a killing. Its supposed to read like a book, Sergeant LoPuzzo said weeks later, explaining how he wished all cases went that way. Where you can read all the steps in the investigation, and what they saw and what they found and what the video shows and what the evidence shows. So its all one big package.  It was a luxury, the sergeant said, his squad often did not have. The day she died, Maribel Cavero and her    mother, Maria Reyes, had cooked crabs for an early lunch, using a recipe from their native Ecuador. Together, with Ms. Caveros younger sister, Alexandra Cavero, 44, they sat at a small table in the familys   apartment in the Melrose Houses, only a block from the corner where the shot would be fired. Ms. Cavero regaled them with family gossip and news from their home country. The sisters had joined their mother in the United States in 2008, about 12 years after she followed her own mother from Guayaquil, Ecuador, to the South Bronx in hopes of more earnings and a better life. When lunch was finished, Ms. Caveros mother reminded her to drop off the box of sugar substitute to her grandmother, Marcela Troncoso, the    family matriarch, who lived in an apartment on East 154th Street. As she did most days, Ms. Cavero was headed to pick up her sisters    daughter, Gabriela Encalada, from school, because her sister had to leave for her job as a bus driver. But Ms. Cavero would make time for the delivery. She said, Im in a hurry, but Ill do it, Ms. Reyes said in a recent interview. Ill do it.  Ms. Cavero had no husband, no boyfriend and no children, her relatives said. She enjoyed certain solitary pursuits, like romance novels and the online game FarmVille. And aside from family, her regular social activity was Mass at Immaculate Conception Church on East 150th Street. She lived in her own world, her sister said. She was still very nave.  With what relatives called a tranquil focus, she poured her energy into caring for her mother and helping to raise her niece, whom she considered like a daughter. She loved tragic poetry, her sister said, and the writings of Pablo Neruda and the novels of Corn Tellado, a prolific romance writer. At night, she would watch Elvis Presley movies, referring to the singer as her eternal love. She watched James Bond movies, too, but told friends she avoided real romantic entanglements because in her view they always brought pain. In high school, they used to say she seemed like she was in love because when she was into a book, into a piece of literature, she expressed it, and the others would tell her, Youre in love, and her answer would be Yes, Im in love with life, her sister said. In some ways you seem like a little girl, and in some ways youre like an old lady, I used to tell her.  Ms. Cavero worked for a few years as a   nanny, her mother said. But as the children she watched grew, the $   job ended and she wound up working another job her stepfather found for her at a McDonalds on Sixth Avenue and 28th Street in Manhattan. The shifts began late in the day, which gave her time to pick up Gabriela. But they often ended near midnight. Coming home that late, she usually called her mother to tell her she was leaving work. Her mother said Ms. Cavero was afraid of the neighborhood. This is a bad place here, Ms. Reyes said. Sometimes gunfights are heard outside.  When the McDonalds was being remodeled in the fall, Ms. Cavero seized the opportunity to go to Ecuador. She stayed for 45 days with her father, Luis Cavero. She wasnt thrilled to return to New York, where she had been frustrated in finding meaningful work, and she talked of moving home once her niece was older, her sister said. Why did this happen? her sister asked. I dont understand. She was a person who had no vices.  For the investigation into Ms. Caveros killing, finding the small, smooth slug under a Jeep near the body was the cases first big break. Detectives who found it cordoned off the area with crime scene tape. One hunched down, unloaded the magazine of his own   pistol and pulled out a bullet to compare. The slugs were the same size. Another bystander told officers he had seen a man running wildly with something black in his hand through the Melrose playground a block and a half away. Detectives traced a ballistic path westward along East 154th Street and found a plumber who told them he had seen the shooting as he walked with his lunch from the Twin Deli Grocery at East 154th and Courtlandt. The plumber told detectives he saw one young man chase another, then stop and raise his arm. He heard a gunshot and the tinkle of a brass shell hitting the sidewalk as the gunman turned back and sprinted into the Melrose Houses. The shell was there, under some scaffolding, on the northeast corner, and detectives placed a white foam cup over it to preserve it as evidence. After detectives went looking for surveillance video, they found footage from at least five nearby stores and buildings, a bonanza in a neighborhood where security cameras are scarce and often out of order. One video showed a teenager racking a gun, dropping something, then firing. On the street, besides the shell casing, detectives discovered an object they believed had also fallen from the gunmans hands: a silver cigarette lighter. Television satellite trucks began showing up, a rare but welcome sight for investigators in this part of the city, who hoped publicity might encourage witnesses to come forward. The evening news broadcasts were soon underway, and in a place where even horrific killings often draw only brief coverage, the local stations were going big with the news of an innocent bystander shot dead. For Sergeant LoPuzzo, a steady diet of coffee and cigarettes does nothing to blunt his frustration over witnesses who will not speak. In case after case, as recently as a shooting on New Years Day, even seriously injured victims tell a similar story: Felt pain, saw nothing.  But the Cavero case was already going differently, and then a call came from the 40th Precinct station house on Alexander Avenue. Detectives told the sergeant, who was still at the scene, that a man had walked into the   squad room claiming to have been in the gunmans cross hairs. I said, Do not let him leave, Sergeant LoPuzzo recalled. Within minutes, the man, Carlos Vasquez, was putting his account in writing in front of a detective. In his statement, he said he saw the news of Ms. Caveros death on television and realized that a woman was shot and killed by the bullet that was intended for me.  I informed my family that I was going to the precinct so I can tell the detectives what happened and tell them I wanted this guy brought to justice, he said in his statement, which both he and a detective signed. Its one of the rare things where hes got a conscience, Sergeant LoPuzzo later said. Mr. Vasquez had been arrested more than a dozen times and had been convicted of drug dealing and illegal possession of a knife. He was a   if   drug dealer. He sold in the Melrose Houses near the corner of East 153rd Street and Courtlandt Avenue, where his mother lived, according to court records and the police. In implicating Mr. Oquendo, Mr. Vasquez never explained how the fight had started. In his own words, he said he had left his building on Nov. 2 in search of marijuana and was waiting for a dealer near a flagpole at the neighboring Jackson Houses when two men assaulted him. He ran. But before he could make it to the safety of his mothers house, one of the assailants closed the gap, with a gun in hand. As Im running, I turn around to see him point a gun at me and fire it, Mr. Vasquez said in his statement, though he did not know Mr. Oquendos name. I ducked between cars.  Even before Mr. Vasquez came in, detectives reviewing the recovered video images from the delis cameras thought they had identified a suspect. Officers assigned to a plainclothes   unit recognized the person in the surveillance footage as Mr. Oquendo, the teenager with a lengthy arrest record who was known to officers as Gumby.  The case detective, Ivan Monge, also knew the gunman when he saw the video. He had arrested Mr. Oquendos older sister on assault charges in October. I told myself, Wait, this is Gumby, this is Oquendo, he said. Detectives did not recover the gun. But with the videos, the witnesses, the bullet, the shell casing and the name of the suspect lining up, Sergeant LoPuzzos team made one more breakthrough: Detective David Rodriguez remembered that the suspects mother was an old neighbor of his from Spanish Harlem. They had grown up together, their families had attended the same church and they had spoken after one of Mr. Oquendos previous arrests. The detective contacted the mothers relatives on Facebook and eventually got her on the phone. He told her he needed her to bring in her son safely. Like a mother, she didnt believe it, Detective Rodriguez said. And she wanted the proof.  Detective Rodriguez went to her home and took her to the squad room, where he showed her a wanted flier with an image of her son taken from the videos. She came in only because she trusted him, said Detective John Caruso, another detective working on the case. Finally she broke down. Yeah, she said, according to Detective Rodriguez, thats my son.  By the next night, the detectives were packed in the lobby of the Legal Aid Societys office on East 161st Street in the Bronx. Steven Mechanic, a veteran public defender who had represented Mr. Oquendo against several criminal charges in the past, surrendered him to the police. There are no winners in this case, Mr. Mechanic said later, declining to discuss the new charges or Mr. Oquendos previous convictions. Mr. Oquendo was led away. His parents cried. He told me he came over from Cuba on a boat, 20 years ago, Detective Rodriguez said of the suspects father. I know the mothers side of the family personally. Ive known them for years. He comes from a good family, but everyone takes their own path in life.  Orlando Oquendos mother sat in her living room in the Jackson Houses one recent night, with a stack of letters written by her son in jail piled on her lap. She nodded toward the streets outside her   window and spoke of her sons sorrow for Ms. Caveros death. If he did do it, it was not intentional. It was not toward her, she said of the shooting. A person was lost, so its going to hurt.  She felt a kinship for Ms. Caveros family. Both were Latino families, she said, one from Puerto Rico and Cuba, the other from Ecuador. Both were churchgoing, and both were living in a   area they wanted to escape. Mr. Oquendos mother said that taking the apartment in the Jackson Houses 11 years ago was the worst decision she had ever made. Mr. Oquendo, the fourth of her six children, was troubled and, from a young age, attended a special school for emotionally disturbed children. It was hard to stay neutral in the projects   gang feuds, and he got into fights constantly. He seemed unable to back down from a threat. He would not stay shut when challenged, said his mother, who spoke on the condition that her name not be published. He had good hands. He could defend himself.  Twice, her son was accused of crimes involving guns, according to court documents and law enforcement officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss confidential records. In February 2014, a young woman told the police that Mr. Oquendo, who was 15, fired several shots at her, one official said. He was indicted on a gun possession charge in that case, which was transferred to family court and sealed. Then, in August 2015, he was arrested when a police officer saw him drop a .  revolver wrapped in a   on Courtlandt Avenue near East 157th Street, a criminal complaint said. He later pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and was given a conditional discharge, the official said. Mr. Oquendos mother said he was supposed to be graduating from high school this month and then going to work for his fathers plumbing business. Her son had been coaching young basketball players at the local Classic Community Center, on the courts where Chris McCullough of the Brooklyn Nets once reigned. He had proposed to his longtime girlfriend, telling her they could someday move to a safer neighborhood with their son, O. J. born on Aug. 16. If this kid could relive this day, Im sure he wouldnt do the same thing that he did, Sergeant LoPuzzo said. But once you pull that trigger, you cant pull that back.  Still, the pressures were mounting, said Mr. Oquendos mother, who referred to him as her prayer baby for his constant comfort of her. He watched her battle diabetes and heart disease and saw his maternal grandmother dying of colon cancer. The streets enveloped him, she said. In October, he had a dispute with Mr. Vasquez outside a local barbershop. On the day of the shooting, Mr. Vasquezs nephew, a friend of the Oquendo family, sent messages to Mr. Oquendos sister to find out what had happened. After speaking with Detective Rodriguez, Mr. Oquendos mother reached her son and asked him to surrender. I told him, The best thing to do is to turn yourself in, and lets see what happens, she said. I dont want my son out on the run.  Now, he is in a Rikers Island jail cell, facing a   indictment on murder and other charges. He turned 18 there and spent Thanksgiving and Christmas alone. But his letters and cards keep coming, almost daily, filled with apologies for letting his mother down and promising to come home. In a letter on Dec. 30, he told her not to worry, writing, God has a plan, and Lets hope God gives us a short, easy punishment.  Ms. Caveros relatives, who are tracking the suspects court appearances, are afraid of just that: a light sentence. Detectives said that Mr. Oquendos intended victim, Mr. Vasquez, picked him out of a police lineup, but that the plumber who witnessed the shooting had been too afraid to try the same. DNA tests on the silver lighter recovered near the shell casing were inconclusive. In her living room, two blocks from the Oquendo family, Ms. Caveros mother, Ms. Reyes, also sat on a couch with a pile of envelopes, these containing court papers and other official documents. She thought back to the moment the police informed her of her daughters killing. Detective Monge, the case detective, had knocked on her door to deliver the news in Spanish, and she was grateful for his compassion. But even after a wake, in which her daughter was dressed all in white, and a funeral, in Ecuador, she said the randomness of the death     in which a person with no enemies or vices was taken violently     remained the abiding mystery. It is a question the police cannot answer. That is what I ask myself, Ms. Reyes said, tears falling down her cheeks. Why did this happen this way?"
White House Looking for Press Secretary to Replace Sean Spicer at Podium - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/19/2017,"`Senior White House aides and press secretary Sean Spicer are searching for a new face at the White House podium, according to several reports. [Both reports signal that Spicer wants to move into a more senior communications role, shifting the daily banter with the press to a new face.  We have sought input from many people as we look to expand our communications operation, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a statement to Bloomberg. As he did in the beginning, Sean Spicer is managing both the communications and press office.  Spicer and White House chief of staff Reince Priebus reached out to Laura Ingraham to discuss a possible position, according to Politico. Daily Mail editor David Martosko was not interviewed, according to Bloomberg.  Politico reports that Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle is no longer interested in the position and few serious prospects for the position have surfaced in the process."
Kushner heads to Jerusalem and Ramallah to talk peace,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,6/19/2017,"(CNN) White House senior adviser Jared Kushner will travel to Israel and Ramallah in the West Bank this week. Kushner will arrive Wednesday, meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, and then going to Ramallah to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas. The Kushner trip was first reported in the Wall Street Journal. President Donald Trump has made it clear that working towards achieving a lasting peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians is a top priority for him, a White House official told CNN.  Trump has asked some of his most trusted advisers to spearhead that effort, including     Kushner and assistant to the President and Special Representative for International Negotiations Jason Greenblatt. The two men work closely together.  Greenblatt, who works as the administrations   negotiator, will travel to the region on Monday.  In May, Kushner and Greenblatt both accompanied the President on his visit to Jerusalem and Bethlehem to discuss a peace agreement.  Since then, conversations have been ongoing, the White House official said. To build on that trip, Kushner and Greenblatt will return to Jerusalem and Ramallah for meetings to discuss priorities and potential next steps with Netanyahu and his senior advisers as well as Abbas and his senior advisers, the official said.  Kushners broad role, Kushner, the    commercial real estate magnate whose marriage to Trumps eldest daughter has thrust the otherwise inexperienced diplomat into the center of US foreign relations, now wields a hefty foreign affairs portfolio in the Trump administration. Trumps Secretary of Everything: Jared Kushner, He has compiled a   itinerary including North America, the Middle East and China.  In April, Kushner traveled to Iraq aboard a military aircraft, as part of his broad portfolio of foreign affairs in the Trump presidency. Kushners expansive responsibilities dont end at foreign affairs. He is tasked with leading a presidential office on reshaping the federal bureaucracy, discussing criminal justice reform, improving the Department of Veterans Affairs and tackling the nations opioid abuse epidemic.  Kushners involvement in his   s administration has raised questions, especially regarding his ties to Russia during the presidential transition.  In March, CNN reported Kushner had relationship meetings with Russias Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and with Russian banker Sergey Gorkov to discuss issues like sanctions. Last month, news surfaced that Kushner may have discussed creating a secret communications channel between the Trump transition team and the Kremlin with Kislyak.  Last week, the Washington Post reported that Kushners business dealings are being investigated by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller."
Remembering the seven USS Fitzgerald sailors,CNN,Chandrika Narayan,6/19/2017,"(CNN) The youngest was 19, a Virginia volunteer firefighter described as a positive, uplifting guy. The oldest was a    from Ohio, just three months short of retirement.  All seven were driven by a mission to serve and a passion for the sea. Many followed their parents into the Navy. It was their calling. All were killed when their warship, the USS Fitzgerald, collided with a merchant vessel Saturday in the crowded waters off Japans Izu Peninsula. Most were asleep when it happened. They were found in the destroyers flooded berthing compartments.  The Navy released the sailors names Sunday. Here are their stories.  Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, Rank: Yeoman 3rd Class, Hometown: Oceanside, California, Douglass, a 2010 graduate of Fallbrook High School north of San Diego, was an avid video game player who followed his dad into the Navy, his father told the San Diego  .  Were still in sort of a state of shock, said retired US Marine Corps Master Sgt. Stephen Douglass. Douglass was born at the naval hospital in Okinawa and spent many summers as a boy in Japan, learning to speak fluent Japanese, according to a family statement. He was proud of both his Japanese and military family background, they said.  Douglass enlisted in 2014 and joined the destroyer in early 2015 after   training at Naval Station Great Lakes and in Mississippi, the paper reported. In a 2015 interview with the Military Press, Douglass said he was proud to be serving his country. His duties included maintaining the outside of the ship by sanding and painting, line handling and raising and lowering the rafts. The Navy is allowing me to travel, get a better understanding of how they operate while out at sea, the sailor said.  His family described him as an adventurous young man, who loved to travel.  He was a certified scuba diver and a Black Belt in karate, and played tennis. He was also an avid gamer, studied computer game design and loved to attend Comic Con, they said in a statement.  In a post on Facebook the mother of one of Douglass friends called him a very sweet kind boy with a big bright smile that lit up the room. Shingo served his Nation proudly, and we are also very proud of him and his service. We loved him very much and his parents and younger brother will miss him more than words can express, his family said in a statement. Noe Hernandez, 26, Rank: Gunners Mate 2nd Class, Hometown: Weslaco, Texas, Hernandez cousin says that pictures the sailor shared of his travels brought them closer, even though they were separated by thousands of miles of ocean.  We lived through his experiences. His travels, Aly   told CNN affiliate KTVT. We were just proud that our boy was up there. The cousin said Hernandez died in the collision from a head injury as he slept.  When they confirmed it, it was like a kick to the chest, she told KTVT.  Noe met his wife Dora, who was in the ROTC, in high school. That was his first love. .. his only love,   told the affiliate. Hernandez also is survived by a young son, Leon. The familys next step is to come together to honor his life and legacy. We all came from poverty in Guatemala, says  .  He was the one who made it. And we were so proud of him.  Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, Rank: Sonar Technician 3rd Class, Hometown: Oakville, Connecticut, Huynhs family moved to Connecticut when he was in eighth grade, his sister Lan Huynh told WVIT. The siblings graduated from Watertown High School, Lan Huynh said. Her brother, who went by the name Tan, attended Naugatuck Valley Community College before joining the Navy in 2014. The family moved to Oklahoma after Huynh enlisted, and that might have led to a delay in notifying them of his death, according to his sister. We got a phone call from the Navy personnel in Connecticut. He couldnt find us because he didnt know we had moved to Oklahoma, Lan Huynh told WVIT. She said the family is coping as best they can. He was a really quiet person. He was also very nice, very selfless. He helped us, the family with a lot, she told WVIT. He had the brightest smile. One friend posted on Facebook how much she cherished her memories of Huynh: You were such a genuine and kind hearted person and it pains me that you are no longer here. Xavier Alec Martin, 24, Rank: Personnel Specialist 1st Class, Hometown: Halethorpe, Maryland, When Darrold Martin saw the Navy chaplain at his front door on Sunday    Fathers Day    he knew his son was gone. Its very hard. Hes my only child, hes all I have, Martin told CNN affiliate WJZ of son Alec, who joined the Navy to follow in his fathers footsteps.  Martin said he raised his son as a single father for most of the young mans life and that they shared a close bond. They even had matching tattoos.  His son graduated from Lansdowne High School with honors in 2010.  Now Martin is trying to come to grips with his new reality    and encouraging others to appreciate what they have. It just occurred to me call everybody . .. every dad that I knew, and say Happy Fathers Day, Martin said.

His wife, Erin Rehm posted to Facebook after his death: We were obsessed with each other. Im just so lost right now, she said in response to a friends comment.   His uncle, Stanley Rehm said he heard from Rehms father that his nephew made heroic efforts to save his fellow sailors.  He went back down to where the other ones were at to save them, Stanley Rehm told CNN afiiliate WJW. The ship was flooding so fast they had to close the hatch to save the ship. They had to sacrifice the few to save the many. Guess he died a hero. The world has lost a wonderful person, another family friend posted on Facebook. I can confidently say that he was one of the best people I had the pleasure of knowing. Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, Rank: Gunners Mate Seaman, Hometown: Palmyra, Virginia, Dakota Kyle Rigsby graduated from Fluvanna County High School in rural central Virginia, where he played football. His friend Ryan Boon told CNN affiliate WVIR that Rigsby was one of the most positive, uplifting guys I knew in school, no matter what. Before joining the Navy, Rigsby served as a volunteer in the Lake Monticello Fire Department. He grew into what we would consider a good man, Assistant Fire Chief Jean Campbell said at a press conference Sunday, as reported by WVIR. Rigsbys family was originally set to speak at the press conference but were too overwhelmed to do so. The fire departments flag is flying at   and the department has changed its Facebook profile image to a portrait of Rigsby. Its a tragic loss and he was definitely taken entirely too soon . .. Campbell said. We just know that he is watching over us right now. Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, Rank: Fire Controlman 2nd Class, Hometown: Chula Vista, California, Carlos Victor Sibayan was always smiling.  There was never a time that Carlos wasnt making people laugh, Chase Cornils, a fellow cadet in Chaparral High Schools Naval Junior Reserve Officer Training Corps, told the San Diego  .

Sibayan grew up in a military family, as his father served 21 years in the military, his mother told NBC7 in San Diego.  Carmen Sibayan said that while her husband was away, her eldest son became the dad of the family.  In every sense of the word, he is my hero, she told the news station.  Friends said Sibayan was driven to enlist in the Navy as soon as he graduated high school. One posted on Facebook, in part: Carlos was such an amazing guy and great friend. He could always bring a smile to your face with his humor and personality. He served our country well."
Moderates may lose a major fight on Medicaid,CNN,Phil Mattingly,6/19/2017,"(CNN) Senate Republicans might move forward with a plan to make even deeper cuts to Medicaid than the Houses health care bill, which could be a major blow for Senate moderates. According to Senate Republican aides familiar with the Senate negotiations, leaders in the chamber are weighing lowering the annual growth rate for the Medicaid program beginning in 2025. Essentially, from that point on, the money states receive for their Medicaid program would be calculated based off standard inflation,   rather than medical inflation, which is more generous. One aide stressed that, at this point, no final decisions had been made, but the option was on the table and would be discussed this week as members attempt to coalesce around a final proposal. If chosen, it would be a small, but significant change from the House bill that could have a major impact on whether moderate lawmakers ultimately vote for the Senates version of the Obamacare repeal. While the idea might help convince conservatives like Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas or Mike Lee of Utah to view a final proposal more favorably, it could be problematic for moderates like Portman or Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who faces   in 2018. A spokesman told CNN Portman remains opposed to dropping the growth rate below the level of the House bill, which along with ending Medicaid expansion would reduce spending on the program by $800 billion over 10 years. Several other more moderate members of the conference have voiced concern over the idea.  The House bill would transform Medicaid by capping federal support of the program, which covers more than 70 million   children, parents, seniors and the disabled. Slowing the annual growth rate would further reduce the federal funds that states receive to cover their Medicaid enrollees. Since states dont have the money to make up the difference, they would likely have to cut benefits, tighten eligibility or reduce   provider rates. Changing the growth rate for Medicaid, however, is only one in a long line of issues that GOP senators are grappling with as they continue to try to bring a bill to the floor as soon as next week. Portman is playing a key role in another negotiation over Medicaid. Portman has been asking leadership to phase out Medicaid expansion in states like his over a   period, rather than just cutting off federal money for the program in 2020 like the House bill did. According to two GOP aides, however, Portman might not get a win there either. The aides say leadership is leaning toward just a   phase out of the program, which is more generous than the House bill, but still less than the seven years that Portman and other Republicans in Medicaid expansion states have requested."
Deadly heat waves to become more common,CNN,Brandon Miller,6/19/2017,"(CNN) Deadly heat waves are going to be a much bigger problem in the coming decades, becoming more frequent and occurring over a much greater portion of the planet because of climate change, according to a study published Monday in Nature Climate Change. Extreme heat waves, such as the one torching the Southwestern United States and the one plaguing Western Europe, which has sparked wildfires in Portugal that have killed more than 60 people, are frequently cited as one of the most direct effects of   climate change. The study says, by the year 2100, three out of four people on Earth could be subject to at least 20 days per year of heat and humidity associated with deadly heat waves, if greenhouse emissions continue to rise at their current rates. Currently, that number is about one in three people. Even if humans aggressively cut back on fossil fuel emissions, such as outlined in the Paris climate agreement, rising temperatures and humidity levels will combine to increase the intensity and frequency of deadly heat waves, the study said. President Donald Trump recently announced he would be pulling the United States out of the Paris Agreement.  Our attitude towards the environment has been so reckless that we are running out of good choices for the future, said Camilo Mora, associate professor at the University of Hawaii at Manoa and lead author of the study.   For heat waves, our options are now between bad or terrible, Mora said. Many people around the world are already paying the ultimate price of heat waves, and while models suggest that this is likely to continue to be bad, it could be much worse if emissions are not considerably reduced. Determining what makes a heat wave deadly, Heat waves are notoriously deadly, as the human body can only function in a narrow range of body temperatures around 98. 6 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius).  An international team of researchers, led by Mora and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, analyzed hundreds of historic heat waves to quantify what weather conditions posed the greatest risk of death in humans.  Using data from 783 lethal heat waves in 164 cities and across 36 countries, the researchers discovered a common threshold where the heat wave becomes deadly.   This threshold now allows us to identify conditions that are harmful to people. And because it is based on documented cases of real people across the globe, it makes it that much more credible and relevant. The scary thing is how common those deadly conditions are already. Not surprisingly, the threshold is driven not only by the air temperature, but also the relative humidity.  Sweating, the bodys main process to remove heat by evaporative cooling (think the process that makes your body cold after you get out of the shower) becomes much less effective as relative humidity increases, because the air is already more saturated with moisture.   The team was able to use this threshold to distinguish between deadly and   heat waves in the historical record, and then use the same threshold to observe how these conditions will play out in the future using climate models run with different greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Future of deadly heat, The study allows us to peer into the future for any location on Earth and see how many days per year, on average, that location will cross the potentially deadly threshold the group has identified.  A web application was also developed so you can view any location under any of the potential emission scenarios.  For example, New York City, which now sees about two days per year that cross the threshold, rises to about 50 days per year by 2100. The results paint a grim picture, where entire summers exceed the threshold in warmer and more humid cities like Orlando and Houston. Currently, about 30% of the worlds population (and about 13% of the land area) experiences at least 20 days per year on which the deadly threshold is reached. By 2100, this percentage jumps to 74% of the population (47% of the land area) if emissions continue unchecked.  Aggressive cutbacks now on emissions could help, though only slightly. If we do the best that we can, which is the Paris Agreement, you are still going to have nearly 50% of the human population impacted, which is pretty bad, Mora said. But if we dont do anything, we are going to have [more than] 70% of the population affected by these heat waves, which is terrible, said Mora. Unfortunately there isnt much we can do to make the situation better, Mora said while speaking of the Paris Agreement. But by doing nothing, We can certainly make it a lot worse.  Greatest risk in the tropics  While   locations will warm more than the tropics under global warming, this study indicates that a greater threat to life will be in the more humid, tropical locales.   According to the study, because areas in the tropics have higher   warm temperatures and higher humidity, they require less warming to cross the deadly threshold. In the deep tropics, such as in Jakarta, Indonesia, the entire year is pegged to be above the potentially deadly level. Unfortunately, many of these parts of the world are less able to adapt to worsening heat waves as well, with limited access to air conditioning and unreliable electrical grids.   Dr. Marshall Shepherd, director of the University of Georgias Atmospheric Sciences Program,  was not involved in the study but agreed with its findings. Study after study finds discernible fingerprints of climate change in contemporary heat waves, Shepherd said. Most people know that summer is also the most uncomfortable in terms of heat and humidity. Basic physics relationships explain why a warmer climate will likely mean more oppressive heat indices and   health issues. Shepherd also said that we often overlook the impact that cities have on the intensity of heat waves, through the urban heat island effect. We have overlooked that some of the most dangerous warming is associated with increasingly intense heat waves plus urban heat, Shepherd said. Globally, more people live in cities and that trend will continue."
Georgia 6th guarantee: Nothing gets resolved,CNN,Gregory Krieg,6/19/2017,"(CNN) By the time Americans wake up Wednesday, there will in all likelihood be a new   en route from Georgias sixth Congressional District to Washington. What that person does upon arrival is pretty much beside the point. Its the letter R or D next to his or her name thats become a national political fixation.  Both Jon Ossoff, the Democrat, and Karen Handel, the Republican, are party people. Despite taking steps to distance themselves from their   future colleagues, neither figure to turn up on Capitol Hill and make much of a stir. The winner of Tuesdays special election will be granted a relatively brief lease on the seat, about 18 months, most of them unfolding in the muck of yet another campaign season.  And still, this contest    the most expensive in congressional history    has very real meaning to both parties. It is, and has been for months, the foremost contest of the Donald Trump era and the first that Democrats and Republicans seem to agree should be taken as a referendum on the White House and a bellwether for whats to come in the 2018 midterm elections.  So there are lessons to be learned. Both sides are eager to begin sorting, shaping and spinning them, and then arguing with one another and amongst themselves over how those lessons should influence future tactics. Wednesday morning is not an end    its just another beginning. Defeat in a district theyve owned for a generation will put fear into Republicans who even a few months ago considered their seats safe from any meaningful challenge. Will it create a panic, though, with nervy incumbents flouting leadership in an effort to save their own hides? That still seems a ways off. Across the aisle, the stakes are higher. Eyes are twitchier. Democrats are a desperate for a win and some sign of an exit from the cold, lonely highway theyve been driving since the late evening hours of November 8, 2016. Whether or not Ossoff, a    moderate whose bravest moment probably came on the day he announced his bid, has the directions home is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. A loss would add another layer of complications to a familiar, divisive narrative. On the left, questions about the party leaderships broader strategy    or lack thereof    will grow louder still. Yes, Sen. Bernie Sanders is backing Ossoff. No, his supporters will not suffer another stumble any more quietly than the last.   Trump won this district by about a percentage point. If Handel prevails, polls suggest her margin will be similarly narrow. Some Democrats will be quick to note that Tom Price, the congressman whose departure to join the administration created the   vacancy, won   last year by more than 20 points. Others, however, will suggest, given the national spotlight, that comparing Ossoffs performance to Clintons strong showing would make for a more accurate assessment. Democrats are also sure to argue that, win or lose, requiring the GOP to dedicate gobs of money to defending a district that House Speaker Newt Gingrich once called home should be cause for hope. Others    along with every Republican who feels like chatting (or tweeting)    will note the Democrats own massive investment, and either rage or chuckle at what that spending got in return.   Take your pick. If there is any certainty about this race, it is that uncertaintys reign will continue on long after its conclusion. There will be celebration and recrimination. Signs and wonders. But actual lessons? Those will be more difficult to come by."
Two big changes in Antarctica have scientists worried,CNN,AJ Willingham,6/19/2017,"(CNN) Antarctica is experiencing weird weather, and the changes have some scientists worried about the future. Theres an area on the west side of the icy continent called the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and last January, scientists found a    portion of its perimeter was melting. Thats an area roughly two times the size of California, covered in slush.  According to recent research published in Nature Communications, the melt was caused by an unusually strong El Nio event around January 2016. A melt of this magnitude is relatively rare in Antarctica, said Julien Nicolas, one of the papers authors at the Ohio State University Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center. There have been about three or four events of this size in the last 40 years.  Warmer weather, more melt: Confirmed  El Nio is a weather event that brings unusually warm water in the Pacific Ocean, and one of the big takeaways from the research is that this strong El Nio in 2016 directly contributed to the unusually widespread Antarctic ice melt. The news also is ominous for another reason: It means the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is essentially being melted from both sides. El Nios push warm water under the sheet. On top, colder westerly winds usually do enough to stave off any approaching warm weather, but in the 2016 incident, they didnt. This event also brought about another surprise for scientists: Rain. We saw in our observations that there were some rain, we heard from some parties on the Ross Ice Shelf, and we saw it on the weather models, Nicolas said. Thats very unusual. We dont have a record of rain in Antarctica, so we dont know how often its happened in the past.  Why it matters  Rain and slush would make for a miserable day anywhere, but the weird weather patterns observed over the   period in 2016 painted a potentially worrisome picture for the future.  If more extreme El Nios occur, ice shelves such as the Ross Ice Shelf on the West Antarctic Ice Sheet will melt and be weakened. Sometimes, those ice melts can lead to dramatic rivers and waterfalls that leak off of the ice structure. Take a look at a recent video of the Nansen Ice Shelf, which is north of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet:  The ice melt from 2016 wasnt as dramatic. It was more of a slush on top of the ice, Nicolas says. Still, he adds, even if the melted slush and water refreezes they can leak into cracks and damage the inner structure of the ice. Remember, these are massive, massive networks of ice that cant really be thought of as one homogenous, unchanging object.  If these shelves are weakened, the could crack and break off, and that would open the floodgates    literally. When it comes to the disintegration of the ice shelves, they are like corks in a bottle, says Dr. David Bromwich, another author of the paper and a professor at the Ohio State.  They are holding back the contents of the bottle, in this case the ice sheet, and you take the cork away and everything flows out to the ocean. Once the ice is in the ocean, Bromwich says, it could cause sea levels to rise dramatically and rapidly. Rapidly, of course, means something completely different on a geological time scale. We dont know the time scale of this, he said. There was one modeling study that showed quite dramatic changes on the scale of a few hundred years, and another scenario would be quite a slow change. But a foot of sea rise, or two feet, in the order of 100 years would be alarming."
Former North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier dies,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/19/2017,"(CNN) American college student Otto Warmbier only intended to spend five days sightseeing in North Korea in 2016.  Instead, he spent 17 months there in detention where his family believes he was tortured into a vegetative state. On Monday, less than a week after returning to the United States with severe brain damage, his family announced Warmbier had completed his journey home. The    died Monday afternoon in Cincinnati, Ohio, with his family at his side.  It would be easy at a moment like this to focus on all that we lost    future time that wont be spent with a warm, engaging, brilliant young man whose curiosity and enthusiasm for life knew no bounds, his family said. But we choose to focus on the time we were given to be with this remarkable person. The students death elicited strong repudiations of the regime from the highest levels of the American government. The news could lead the US to take a tougher line on China, the hermit regimes closest ally, as the two superpowers begin high level talks this week. It also prompted the tour group that facilitated Warmbiers visit to end trips to North Korea for Americans.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who helped push for Warmbiers release, said the United States holds North Korea accountable for an unjust imprisonment.  The North Korean government said he fell into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill in March 2016. But US doctors said they found no evidence of the illness. Let us state the facts plainly: Otto Warmbier, an American citizen, was murdered by the Kim Jong Un regime, said US Sen. John McCain,  .  President Donald Trump condemned the brutal regime and lamented the loss of a young man in the prime of life. Ottos fate deepens my administrations determination to prevent such tragedies from befalling innocent people at the hands of regimes that do not respect the rule of law or basic human decency. The United States once again condemns the brutality of the North Korean regime as we mourn its latest victim. South Korean President Moon   sent his condolences to Warmbiers family, as well as a letter, the presidential spokesman confirmed. Warmbier had not spoken or moved in any purposeful way since his return, a condition his doctors called unresponsive wakefulness also known as persistent vegetative state. He had suffered significant brain damage during his imprisonment. The family thanked the staff at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center for doing everything they could for their son in his final days. Unfortunately, the awful torturous mistreatment our son received at the hands of the North Koreans ensured that no other outcome was possible beyond the sad one we experienced today. Trip ends in allegations  Otto Warmbier was a University of Virginia student when he was detained in January 2016. He had signed up for a trip to North Korea with Young Pioneer Tours travel group. It was to be a brief stay followed by a visit to Beijing. But as he tried to depart from Pyongyangs airport, he was stopped in security. According to the North Korean government, Warmbier was detained because he had stolen a political poster from a restricted floor in his hotel. The next time the world saw Warmbier he was distraught, breaking down in front of Korean journalists in a video North Korea released in February 2016.  He admitted to the crime and begged for forgiveness. He pleaded to be released. Instead, he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor. His death led Young Pioneer Tours to announce it would no longer offer US citizens trips to North Korea. The group said it was denied requests to meet Warmbier or anyone whod been in contact with him in Pyongyang, only receiving assurances that he was fine.  The devastating loss of Otto Warmbiers life has led us to reconsider our position on accepting American tourists. There had not been any previous detainment in North Korea that has ended with such tragic finality and we have been struggling to process the result. Now, the assessment of risk for Americans visiting North Korea has become too high. Kenneth Bae, a US citizen who was detained by North Korea for 735 days before his release in 2014, described Warmbiers death as an outrage and a tragedy. We plead with the US government, the international community, and leadership in North Korea to value human lives. Every life is important    Ottos life, lives of the American detainees, and the lives of each person in North Korea, Bae said. I pray that these innocent people suffering in North Korea are not forgotten in this   game of weapons, sanctions, and international diplomacy, he added.  Three US citizens and a Canadian pastor are still being detained in North Korea.  How the US secured his release, Warmbiers father last week praised the Trump administration for bringing his son home and criticized the Obama administrations approach, saying the family heeded the US governments initial advice to take a low profile without result. After being briefed on the situation, Trump directed Tillerson to take appropriate measures to secure the release of American hostages there, a senior State Department official told CNN. Tillerson began the effort and routinely updated the President. Then, on June 6, State Department special representative Joseph Yun learned of Warmbiers deteriorating health in a meeting with North Korean UN Mission Ambassador Pak   in New York City, the senior State Department official said. Yun went to North Korea on June 12 with a medical team to secure Warmbiers release, the official said. Yun and two doctors visited Warmbier that morning, marking the first time the United States was able to confirm his status since he was sentenced in March 2016. Yun immediately demanded that Warmbier be released on humanitarian grounds and arrangements were made for him to leave. He was evacuated the next day and reunited with his family in Cincinnati. When Otto returned to Cincinnati late on June 13 he was unable to speak, unable to see and unable to react to verbal commands. He looked very uncomfortable    almost anguished, the familys statement said.  Although we would never hear his voice again, within a day the countenance of his face changed    he was at peace. He was home and we believe he could sense that."
A Year of Hate: 9 Times the Radicalized Left Engaged in Violence in the Trump Era - Breitbart,Breitbart,Alex Clark,6/18/2017,"Wednesdays attempted baseball massacre by alleged shooter James Hodgkinson appears to be just the latest in a series of violent outbursts from the Left. Heres a list of just some of those incidents to highlight a boiling climate of hate that has amplified dramatically during the 2016 election and Donald Trumps presidency. [1. Protesters Attack Trump Supporters Outside a Rally in San Jose, California,   Above: A Trump supporter has eggs thrown at her (Noah   Associated Press)  NOW: #Trump supporter attacked and left bleeding in San Jose pic. twitter.      Tim Pool (@Timcast) June 3, 2016,  Above: A Trump supporter gets sucker punched   On June 2, 2016, extreme left groups converged on a Trump rally in San Jose, California with various messages including America was Never Great Get off   soil and F*ck Donald Trump.  Some of the protesters threw eggs at a Trump supporter. Others snuck up and punched Trump supporters leaving the rally. The ensuing havoc led to the victims of this assault to sue San Jose, the city mayor, and the city police chief over negligence in failing to prevent the chaos. 2. Trump Fundraiser Attacked,  Above: Protesters trying to stop Donald Trumps motorcade after his Minneapolis fundraiser ( @EmmaSapong) Some protesters got aggressive at the end of the night as Trump supporters left Minneapolis fundraiser. @StarTribune pic. twitter.

In response to the attack, Donald Trump tweeted out, Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP,     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016,  4.    Trump Supporter Punched and Kicked During High School   Protest,  Above:  @RamirezReports, They jumped him and beat him up pretty bad, a witness recounted to WTOP radio. The victim, wearing a Make America Great Again hat, was beaten during a walkout   protest from Montgomery High School in Rockville, Maryland. Police officers claimed the victim displayed no signs of aggression during the attack. 5. F*ck Donald Trump, F*ck White People WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT,  Above: A young, mentally disabled man had his torture live streamed as his captors shouted   and   epithets.  In what is perhaps the most sinister example on this list, a young    with schizophrenia was beaten and tortured in a Chicago home in January of 2017. His torturers live streamed the affair on Facebook Live. He was forced to drink toilet water and part of his head was scalped. While the young mans political affiliation remains unknown, his attackers shouted, F*ck Trump and F*ck white people.  The whole episode was so horrendous that it drew significant mainstream media attention and condemnation from   Obama. 6. Antifa Rioters Lay Waste to DC in Response to Trump Inauguration,  Above: Antifa terrorism in Washington following Trumps inauguration ( @nicknbcboston) Antifas representatives and members of   organizations such as BAMN, proudly engage in violence with the justification that any speech they do not like is, in fact,   against future violence. Their rage was on full display in Washington, DC in the days surrounding Trumps inauguration. Rioters smashed the windows of cars and businesses. One Trump supporter was assaulted as he attempted to put out   fires. As Breitbart News reported:   protesters wearing black masks clashed with police officers in front of the National Press Club Thursday night, January 19, 2017. The   DeploraBall event inside drew the ire of the hundreds of anarchists and their associates. Many of the   protesters physically resisted police efforts to clear the sidewalk as others shot their middle fingers to the police officers. 7. Antifa Goes on Rampage in Berkeley to Protest Milo Yiannopoulos  Above: Burning Berkeley (The Associated Press) Above: A Trump supporter is pepper sprayed by while giving an interview at UC Berkeley, A student got pepper sprayed, fires raged across campus, windows got smashed and dozens of Milo fans were assaulted on February 1, 2017. Leftist responses to the Berkeley maelstrom (the first of many for 2017) ranged from praise, to conspiracy theories and to blaming Trump. Many were quick to point out that the iconic flashpoint of free speech protests had now become a symbol of suppression of free speech. 8. Antifa Assaults Trump Supporter with Bike Lock in Berkeley, WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT,  Above: A video depicting the assault of a Trump supporter, On April 15, an assailant later identified as a college professor, Eric Clanton, reportedly beat a Trump supporter with a bike lock.

Indeed, it does not even scratch the surface of calls for violence in rhetorical discourse. To give perspective, over 12, 000 tweets have called for Trumps assassination since his inauguration. This list merely highlights significant incidents of Leftist violence to illustrate heightening divisions in a country increasingly fractured on political fault lines. These divisions have grown to the point where it is not improbable that Wednesdays alleged shooter could have been influenced by partisan rhetoric to shoot up a Congressional baseball game after rationalizing that Its time to destroy Trump  Co.  (His attempts were met with praise on the   corners of Twitter.) These events and others have led commentators on both the right and the left to postulate whether America is perhaps in the beginning stages of Civil War."
Big Cases Still Waiting for Supreme Court Decisions in 2017 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ken Klukowski,6/18/2017,"WASHINGTON, DC     Seventeen cases from this years Supreme Court term are still pending, with decisions expected in the next eight days. Religious liberty, the constitutional rights of illegal aliens, and   rights to express messages some people find offensive are several of the   issues raised in the remaining cases. [Some notable cases include:  In Jennings v. Rodriguez, the Supreme Court is considering whether the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause entitles aliens being held in federal facilities to a bond hearing, such that if they post bond they could be released into the U. S. civilian population. Justices asked hard questions of both sides during oral argument in November. In Sessions v. Dimaya, another case involving aliens, the Court will decide whether a key provision in the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) governing the deportation of certain aliens is so vague that it violates the Due Process Clause. In Lee v. Tam, the justices will decide whether the provision of federal law that authorizes denying trademark protection because of content some consider disparaging violates the First Amendment. The Federal Circuit invalidated the restriction, which has direct application to the Washington Redskins and billboards expressing views critical of militant Islam. In Ziglar v. Abbasi, the High Court will determine whether a plaintiff can directly sue individual FBI agents for detaining illegal aliens after the   attacks. In Hernandez v. Mesa, the Court will decide whether Fourth Amendment protections apply to a   shooting involving U. S. agents on the American side and a Mexican across the border, where the Mexican died and his family is suing the American agents. During oral argument, the justices focused heavily on the   aspect of this situation and whether the U. S. State Department should be in the lead, rather than courts. In Packingham v. North Carolina, the justices will consider whether registered sex offenders can be banned from social network platforms like Facebook, given the number of children the offender could have contact with. In Murr v. Wisconsin, the Supreme Court will consider aspects of when government so completely regulates a piece of property that the land becomes unusable by the owner, such that this triggers the Fifth Amendments Takings Clause requiring the government to pay the owner. The question here is how much of the land the government must compensate the owner for. In Lee v. United States, a legal alien allowed to stay permanently in the United States pleaded guilty to a nonviolent drug crime involving ecstasy, not knowing that his plea deal would automatically result in his deportation. The case is about whether his rejecting the deal was irrational, such that it was ineffective counsel for his lawyer to fail to explain the deportation consequences of the deal. Judge Alice Batchelder of the Sixth Circuit wrote for her appeals court that his rejection was rational. However, after explaining that binding precedent required her to do so, she flagged several problematic aspects of those precedents so persuasively that the Supreme Court decided to reconsider them. In Trinity Lutheran Church v. Comer, the Supreme Court is considering whether Blaine Amendments     which forbid state funds from going to providers of public service programs only when those providers have a religious mission     violates the First Amendment Free Exercise Clause and the Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause. In   Squibb v. Superior Court of San Francisco County, the justices are exploring how far the Fourteenth Amendment permits state courts to have jurisdiction over    businesses. The justices are currently scheduled to hand down all remaining decisions this year on the next two Mondays, June 19 and June 26. However, the Thursday in between, June 22, is often converted into another daily session for handing down decisions. If there are still undecided cases after June 26, the Court could also announce one final session later that week. One uncommon wild card in play this year is that, for most of the term, there was a vacant seat on the Supreme Court. Now that Justice Neil Gorsuch has been confirmed to the seat formerly held by the iconic Justice Antonin Scalia, cases that were originally   tie votes might be rescheduled for a new hearing next year, with Gorsuch as the tiebreaking vote.

A NASA rocket is going to blast colored clouds into space  heres how to see them,Business Insider,Dave Mosher,6/18/2017,"Update: Due to poor weather conditions, NASA delayed   the launch  between 9:05 and 9:20 p. m.   EDT.      For the last two weeks, NASA has been waiting for the right   moment to launch a rocket that will puff clouds of red and     vapor out into space.     The rocket was originally supposed to launch on May 31, but bad   weather and poor visibility have pushed the mission back quite a   few times. The next attempt will be made  with a hopeful liftoff time between 9:05 p. m. and   9:20 p. m. EDT.     To find out if the launch is a go, you can check the facilitys    or      If the skies are clear enough, the sounding rocket carrying the   experiment will launch from NASAs Wallops Flight Facility in   Virginia. In that case, many people on the US East Coast     as far   north as New York City     may see brightly colored puffs of    more than 90 miles above Earth.      The psychedelic space clouds should appear low on the southern   horizon about 5 minutes after the rocket launch.     Ive seen some of these tests where the clouds really filled the   sky, Keith Koehler, a NASA Wallops spokesperson, told Business   Insider. My guess is if you held your fist up, that might be the   size of the clouds [close to the launch site].        If you wont be in the area at that time, dont fret: NASA   Wallops will host live video  with coverage kicking   off around 8:30 p. m. EDT. (A player is embedded at the end of   this post.)     NASAs space clouds, however, arent merely for show.     The experiment is one of many missions in an international    initiative aimed   at helping scientists probe two gaping holes in Earths   protective magnetic shield, called cusps.       The two holes in our invisible shield leak nearly  according to Astronomy Now.     The magnetic bubble that surrounds our planet is vital to life,   since it deflects the suns constant wind of     particles     and protects against the occasional . Without this invisible force field, Earth may   have gone the way of Mars, which lost its magnetic dynamo   billions of years ago. That allowed the sun to blow most of the   Martian atmosphere  turning a once wet and  world into a dry and .        We wont run out of air anytime soon (thankfully, our planet has   quadrillions of tons left) but scientists are still struggling   to understand how the cusps work. In particular, they want to   make them visible     which is where the colored clouds come into   play.     Launching tracer vapors such as barium (green)     ( ) and strontium (red) into the Earths ionosphere       where charged air particles and the solar wind interact     will   show how the clouds move through the region. This data could then   help verify and update computer models of the fringes of Earths   atmosphere.     Those models, in turn, may help researchers better understand all   sorts of   phenomena, including auroras,      and why a planet like Mars lost all its   air while ours has held on to its atmosphere.     Koehler says nearly all   missions, except for a few    spew the vapors directly out of the rocket   body. This limits the data that scientists can collect from the   ground, however, because the colored clouds are close together   and often hard to distinguish.     The upcoming launch will test a new method: Shooting lightweight   canisters, called ampules, out of the sides of the rocket. The 10   canisters are expected to travel 6 to 12 miles before they start   releasing vapor, which should make a constellation of colored   clouds that are easy to distinguish and follow from the ground.     Theyre made of aluminum and about the size of a Coke can,   Koehler said of the ampules.        The chemical tracer clouds arent easily observable by themselves       they react to sunlight. So to maximize their visibility, the   launch will happen when its dark on the ground, yet the sun is   still visible from space.     These launches have to occur just after sunset or right before   sunrise. You need sunlight to hit the vapors and activate them as   theyre released, Koehler said. Auroras dance across the sky,   and this is not that.

"2017: Right Splits over Civil Disobedience, Left Splits over Political Violence - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ezra Dulis,6/18/2017,"This weeks biggest political controversies exposed fault lines within the countrys major political factions, with the right fighting about civil disobedience while the left fought over the attempted murder of a Republican Congressman. [Shakespeare in the Park,  On Friday night, two conservatives disrupted a New York performance of Shakespeares Julius Caesar that escalates the lefts campaign of imagery designed to cathartically depict the death or murder of President Donald Trump. TheRebel. tvs Laura Loomer was arrested for running onstage during the Shakespeare in the Park production, while activist Jack Posobiec taped her demonstration and shouted at the crowd: The blood of Steve Scalise is on your hands! Old Right Several authors at   conservative publications condemned Loomer and Posobiec, arguing that the two infringed on the free speech of Shakespeare in the Park and their tactics were too close to the Occupy of Black Lives Matter movement.   conservatives labeled this faction the old right, stating that there is no moral equivalence between this disruption and the violence of   protesters in dozens of recent incidents.

Steve Scalise, On Wednesday, a    Illinois man opened fire on Republican lawmakers practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, wounding House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and putting him in critical condition through the weekend. The attacker     James Hodgkinson, who was killed by police returning fire     also shot Two Capitol Police officers, a congressional staffer, and a lobbyist. The Daily Caller has reported that investigators found a list of GOP lawmakers names on Hodgkinsons body.

On the day of the shooting, she said     in direct contradiction to virtually every other statement she has made about President Trump and Republicans     that she prayed for unity in the wake of the attack. On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded. https:  .      Nancy Pelosi (@NancyPelosi) June 14, 2017,  Yet the very next day, in a seemingly unscripted moment, she returned to her default position of partisan blame: Somewhere in the 1990s, Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued. Again, I feel as if were having a family moment that is very, very serious and were talking about things that we can say, the discussion   save the discussion for another day. When you have a president that says, I can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and nobody would care, when you have people saying, beat them up and Ill pay their legal fees, when you have all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so sanctimonious is something. The New Political Landscape, Two parties     Republicans and Democrats     still essentially rule American politics, but their constituencies are becoming more tribal and divided, even against their electoral allies. Trump voters hate Republican lawmakers, such as Sens. John McCain and Ben Sasse, for publicly attacking the president and his agenda during and after the 2016 election. Democrats are still picking up the pieces from a contentious DNC leadership race, where   Obama ally Evan Perez narrowly defeated   Rep. Keith Ellison. These same divisions play out in cultural institutions, such as the social justice warriors purging classical liberal professor Bret Weinstein from the Evergreen State College campus or Fox News internal fight over the future of its programming style. The arguments taking place now are over what are appropriate means to victory over the other side: for the right, whether to be polite or ruthless     and for the left, whether to be ruthless or violent."

New York Times Sides with Leftist Mob at Evergreen College - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/18/2017,"The New York Times offered a revisionist history of the ongoing crisis at Evergreen State College in Washington on Saturday, ignoring   violence and smearing liberal professor Bret Weinstein (above) who is a victim of the chaos. [The Times Anemona Hartocollis reported that the college had to hold its commencement 30 miles from campus, at a rented baseball stadium where everyone had to pass through metal detectors.   Her explanation of why that came to pass suggests conservative media are to blame for stirring up threats from outside the campus, and totally ignores the violent role of   activists on campus, some of whom have been patrolling campus with baseball bats. She ignored critical details in the story, such as the fact that campus police told Weinstein they could not protect him. Hartocollis also sided with critics of professor Weinstein, who supported black students efforts to draw attention to racial issues but refused to obey when they told white professors and students not to come to campus. She quoted a professor who is angry that he shared his dispute with the outside press: That he took this public I just feel like is a breach of trust.  Hartocollis also suggested Weinstein is acting out of greed, noting that he has a new blog offering his subscribers insights into evolution, civilization and intolerance for a nominal monthly fee [original link]. Moreover, she did not quote any of Weinsteins supporters, but supplied a quote from a parent whose daughter is opposed to him: Ellis Paguirigan, a 1991 Evergreen graduate whose daughter, Melia, was graduating and planned to go into ocean conservation, said they were both disappointed in Professor Weinsteins stance. Melia had Professor Weinstein in her freshman year and liked his class, Mr. Paguirigan said. But, he added, my daughter is a person of color     she kind of takes it personal.  The implication is that Weinstein is racist     exactly the false charge lobbed by the campus mob. The Times has featured at least one   criticizing the lefts behavior at Evergreen. However, its news coverage of the latest developments is a sign of where the papers true sympathies lie. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Outdoor Clothing Giant Patagonia Pledging to Lead Resistance to President Donald Trump,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/18/2017,"The CEO of outdoor clothing giant Patagonia is burnishing her   bona fides again, this time saying she intends to pledge her entire company to the resistance of President Donald Trump. [Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario recently attacked President Trump for his statements about rolling back President Obamas unusually aggressive campaign of confiscating millions of acres of state lands and claiming them as national monuments.   We have to fight like hell to keep every inch of public land, Marcario said in a May article at Huffpost. I dont have a lot of faith in politics and politicians right now.  In an effort to prevent citizens from retaking possession of their state lands, one of her immediate actions will be to sue the Trump administration for its efforts to scale back Obamas unprecedented land grab. A president does not have the authority to rescind a national monument, Marcario said in an April 26 statement after Trump announced his national monuments order. An attempt to change the boundaries ignores the review process of cultural and historical characteristics and the public input.  In particular, the Trump administration is preparing to revisit Obamas order to create the Bears Ears National Monument. In April, Trump issued an executive order requiring the Department of the Interior to review Obamas actions on national monuments. Ordering Interior Secretary Ray Zinke to review Obamas policies in April, President Trump called Obamas move an egregious abuse of federal power.  Many state governments fully agree with Trumps assessment and were furious when Obama swooped in from Washington and stole away millions of acres of land from state control to create new national monuments and parks. A poll of residents of Utah, for instance, showed that 60 percent opposed Obamas land grab, while only 33 percent supported it. Along with the possible lawsuit, Marcario said Patagonia would use its profits to back   candidates in states throughout the West. This is far from the first time the sportswear company pledged its profits to political matters. Last year, the   company spent over $1 million for a     campaign to defeat Donald Trump and Republicans. But, despite its acclaimed   activism, Patagonia has a troubled history of its own, having been tied to human trafficking and child labor in its supply chain.

He added, This is the problem that Americans have and why they distrust the process and why they distrust Democrats and Republicans alike, because we moved too fast in 2009, but the Republicans didnt learn a lesson, and they are now the ones who have the ball, and its a travesty of justice."

"Orange County, California: Key Battleground for 2018 Midterm Elections - Breitbart",Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,6/18/2017,"Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) told donors on Saturday that Orange County is one of the key battleground regions in the upcoming 2018 midterm elections. [Speaking at the Orange County GOPs annual Flag Day fundraiser on Saturday, Nunes     who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee     sounded off on the importance of receiving support from Republican donors in the region, which is seen as critical in the fight against the Golden States Democratic stronghold.  It is so critical for us to win here and keep winning here, Nunes, who was the events keynote speaker, said, according to the Los Angeles Times. A   Republican California enclave, Orange County is now at risk of turning blue. The 2016 presidential election was the first since 1936 that the county went to a Democrat, Hillary Clinton. In February, the Democrats launched an assault on 20 Republicans whose seats are seen as being at risk during the 2018 midterm elections. Four of those seats are wholly or partially in Orange County, and belong to :Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee Rep. Ed Royce (  ) Rep. Darrell Issa (  ) Rep. Mimi Walters (  ) and Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (  ). Republicans have similarly launched a campaign against at least four California Democrat Congressmen who they plan to target and defeat next year. The National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC)s top offensive targets are Reps. Ami Bera (  Grove, 7th district) Salud Carbajal (  Barbara, 24th district) Scott Peters (  Diego, 52nd district) and Raul Ruiz (  Springs, 36th district).

You could almost see this coming when it happened last week because the level of civil discourse has reached a point that Ive never seen in my time in office, he said, according to the Times. What youre seeing is a political party not willing to accept what happened in the last election. Hopefully its a warning sign and hopefully the media will get back to at least pretending to do some real investigative work.

We just got our first concrete evidence that running for president was good for Trumps businesses,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/18/2017,"President Donald Trumps latest financial disclosure showed that   the general election campaign and early months of his presidency   have been pretty good for his prominent businesses.

Trump   reported more than $37 million in income from his    club   in Florida, the resort most visited by Trump on his weekends.   Thats an increase of nearly $8 million from the 2016 filing and   roughly $22 million from the 2015 edition.

For instance, his Jupiter, Florida golf club had an increase in   revenue from $12. 4 million in 2015 to $20. 1 million in Trumps   most recent filing. His Doral, Florida golf club     arguably the   most prominent of Trumps golf holdings     saw its income increase   from $49. 4 million in 2015 to $115. 8 million in the Friday   filing, although that was actually a decrease of more than $16   million from its income earnings in the previous filing.     The Trump Corporation, the presidents   management   company, nearly tripled its income from a year prior.

President Trump welcomed the opportunity to voluntarily file his   personal financial disclosure form; while this filing is   voluntary (as no report was due until May 2018) it has been   certified by the Office of Government Ethics pursuant to its   normal procedures, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said   in a Friday statement.     The president has stepped back from the Trump Organization,   turning over control to his adult sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric   Trump, in addition to a top Trump Organization executive.   However, the president did not place the assets into a blind   trust or divest from his business interests, a move that many   ethics experts had deemed necessary for the president to avoid   conflicts of interests.    Trump has gone as far as having Donald Jr. and Eric give updates   on the companys finances.  President Donald Trumps latest financial. .."
President Trumps Fathers Day Proclamation: Dads Have Responsibility to Instill in Us Core Values,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/18/2017,"President Donald Trump officially declared today Fathers Day and in doing so sent a message about the responsibility fathers have to instill values and set examples for their children. [Trump also said children should thank their father for the sacrifices he has made for them.  Fathers Day is a special occasion that reminds us to pause and thank the men in our lives who have taken on the responsibility of raising children. As sons and daughters, we recognize the love they have given and the sacrifices they have made, and we celebrate the indispensable role fathers play in our lives and communities. Fathers have the ability and responsibility to instill in us core values we carry into adulthood.  The examples they set and the lessons they impart about hard work, dedication to family, faith in God, and believing in ourselves establish the moral foundation for success that allows us to live up to our full potential.  We remember those fatherly moments big and small    throwing a baseball, writing an essay, driving a car, walking down the aisle    that have shaped us, and we thank our dads for being there with a helping hand and an open heart. Day in and day out, fathers put their children first, creating loving and supportive environments.  Whether by birth, adoption, or foster care, today we honor the incredible fathers in our lives for all they have done and continue to do for us.  Fathers inspire us to better ourselves and to be men and women of outstanding character.  We recommit ourselves as individuals, families, and communities to promoting and supporting fatherhood, and take this day to express our love and appreciation for fathers across our country.

"Watch: Chris Wallace Has Heated Exchange With Trump Attorney Jay Sekulow - Oh Boy, This Is Weird - Breitbart",Breitbart,Pam Key,6/18/2017,"On this weekends broadcast of Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace had a heated exchange with Jay Sekulow, who is member of President Donald Trumps legal team.  Partial transcript as follows: WALLACE: I want to ask you a direct question, does the president think that Rod Rosenstein has done anything wrong? SEKULOW: The president has never said anything about Rod Rosenstein doing anything wrong. Heres what     what is the legal situation here. There is a constitutional issue when you have this scenario. The president made a determination based on consult of advice. He decided ultimately. Hes the commander in chief. He gets to make that decision that James Comey had a go. That was coming, by the way, from groups right, left, and center over the last year. You     you and I know that. So there had been concern about James Comey. It was put forward in a memorandum     thats what the presidents referencing     from the deputy attorney general and the attorney general requesting the removal of James Comey as the FBI director. And, ultimately, thats the presidents determination. So heres the constitutional threshold question, Chris. The president takes action based on numerous events, including recommendations from his attorney general and the deputy attorney generals office. He takes the action that they also, by the way, recommended. And now hes being investigated by the Department of Justice because the special counsel under the special counsel relations reports still to the Department of Justice. Not an independent counsel. So hes being investigated for taking the action that the attorney general and deputy attorney general recommended him to take by the agency who recommended the termination. So thats the constitutional threshold question here. Thats why, as I said, no investigation     WALLACE: Well, I     what     what     whats the question (INAUDIBLE). I mean you     you stated     you stated some facts. First of all, youve now said that he is getting investigated after saying that you didnt. SEKULOW: No. WALLACE: You     you just, sir, that hes being     SEKULOW: No, hes not being investigated! WALLACE: You just said that hes being investigated. SEKULOW: No, Chris, I said that the     any     let me be crystal clear so you     you completely understand. We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the president of the United States, period. WALLACE: Sir, you just said two times that hes being investigated. SEKULOW: No. The context of the tweet, I just gave you the legal theory, Chris, of how the Constitution works. If, in fact, it was correct that the president was being investigated, he would be investigating for taking action that an agency told him to take. So that is protected under the Constitution as his article one power. Thats all I said. So I appreciate you trying to rephrase it, but Im just being really direct with you, Chris. This is     let me be     WALLACE: No, I     I     sir, I didnt rephrase it. The tape will speak     Jay, the tape will speak for itself. You said he is being investigated. And its not that big     SEKULOW: Chris, he is     just     no, Chris     thats (INAUDIBLE) unfair, Chris. WALLACE: Wait a minute     wait a minute. Jay, and its not     Jay, its not just being investigated for firing Comey. Theres also the question of what he said to Comey when Comey was still the FBI director. So theres more than just the fact that he fired Comey. SEKULOW: He     Chirrs, let me be clear, you asked me a question about what the presidents tweet was regarding the deputy attorney general of the United States. Thats what you asked me. And I responded to what that legal theory would be. So I do not appreciate you putting words in my mouth when Ive been crystal clear that the president is not and has not been under investigation. I dont think I can be any clearer than that. WALLACE: Well, you dont know that hes not under investigation again, sir. I mean you might     SEKULOW: You know, I cant read the mind     youre right, Chris, I cant read the minds of the special prosecutor. WALLACE: Well, then, good, OK, so were in agreement, you dont know whether hes under     you dont know whether hes under investigation. SEKULOW: But I have not been notified. No one has been notified that he is. WALLACE: You dont know whether hes under investigation or not. SEKULOW: Chris, I     WALLACE: The question Im asking you is, does he think that Rod Rosenstein     its a very simple question     does he think that Rod Rosenstein did anything wrong? SEKULOW: The president has not expressed any opinion about Rod Rosenstein. WALLACE: Does he think that Robert Mueller has done anything wrong? SEKULOW: First of all, he has not said anything about Robert Mueller. And, Chris, let me say something here. Youre asking me if I had a conversation, which I have not had, about Robert Mueller with the president of the United States on     or anyone else for that matter. I cant discuss that and would that with you. Unlike James Comey, who leaks information to the press, I actually respect the   privilege. Apparently, he did not. WALLACE: Does the President believe     well, youre speaking for his legal team, so youre out here to represent him and tell us what the presidents belief is, is that correct? SEKULOW: No, Im out here to tell you what the facts are and the legal issues are. Im not to tell you what the beliefs are. Im not the clients conscience Im his lawyer. WALLACE: I understand that and the     and the client     have you spoken the     have you spoken to the president at all? SEKULOW: Yes, but Im not going to discuss those conversations with you. Those are privileged under the   privilege. WALLACE: Well, I assume that if he asked you to say something, for instance, Marc Kasowitz said all kinds of things about     after Comeys testimony. I assumed he was speaking for the president, SEKULOW: Marc Kasowitz made a general statement to the press after the testimony of James Comey. Thats what that was about. This     youre asking me now questions about what people are thinking in their minds, which I dont read minds, and youre asking me also what I may or may not have had a conversation with the president about and you understand this. I respect the   privilege, unlike James Comey. WALLACE: Does     SEKULOW: I want to be real clear on that too. Im not going to give you conversations Ive had with     have or have not had with the president of the United States. So when Ive had conversations with the president of the United States     WALLACE: Well, I     your     SEKULOW: As his lawyer, its privileged, period. WALLACE: Does the president think that Rosenstein, because you talked about this constitutional theory that he took action, thats on the advice     SEKULOW: Yes. WALLACE: Although he says he didnt take it on the advice of Rosenstein, does he think that Rosenstein should recuse himself, and is healing the groundwork to fire Rosenstein and Mueller? SEKULOW: Ive had no conversations, and Ive heard nothing without that at all. Nothing. I think this     Chris, this points out     let me tell you one thing quickly about the constitutional theory, as you called it. Its actually called the Constitution. You know, the president has certain (INAUDIBLE) authority under the Constitution. Its     WALLACE: Well, you called it the constitutional theory, sir. SEKULOW: Yes, it is a constitutional theory based on the Constitution. WALLACE: I understand that. SEKULOW: Not  . Its the constitutional theory. Its part of the Constitution. The president has inherent authority. Heres what youre trying to     heres what youre trying to do, Chris, and I appreciate that youre     youre trying to push back. WALLACE: Well, now youre reading minds again. Now youre reading minds again. SEKULOW: No, Chris, I deal with fact and law. You were asking me to read peoples minds. That I dont do. WALLACE: Well, dont tell me what Im trying to     well, dont tell me what Im trying to do because you dont know what Im trying to do. What Im trying to get is a straight answer out of you. Let me ask you this     SEKULOW: Yes, well     sure. WALLACE: As a matter of law, does the President think that he can be indicted under the Constitution? SEKULOW: The president     I havent had that conversation with the president, but the president cant be indicted under the Constitution of the activity alleged in something like this. Of course not. WALLACE: Why is that? SEKULOW: Because theres not an investigation. And theres     theres no investigation against the president. WALLACE: Well, you dont know whether theres an investigation. Oh, boy, this is weird. You     you dont know that theres     whether theres an investigation. You just told us that. SEKULOW: Chris, youre asking me to speculate     so then what youre asking me to do is to speculate on     WALLACE: And it would matter. Im asking you as a matter of law, not whether theres an investigation. Does the president think he can be indicted as president? SEKULOW: For     for     WALLACE: Thats a constitutional issue, isnt it? SEKULOW: For obstruction of justice? No, the Constitutions     WALLACE: No, for any of it. SEKULOW: Now, Chris, you know, lets     lets be realistic here. You know what the     the answer is. Can the president be indicted for obstruction? You know what the position has been at the Department of Justice since the 1970s and again stated in 2000. Thats not what President     thats now how you engage a president. Theres a political process if somebody did something wrong. Youre talking about     youre conflating a constitutional process, criminal law, with an issue of political consequence. So I am his lawyer. Im not his political advisor. WALLACE: Senator Dianne Feinstein, a top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, responded to the presidents tweet this week with this statement. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnt apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired.  Is she wrong, sir? SEKULOW: Yes, shes wrong. First of all, Dianne Feinstein also called for an investigation of James Comey and Loretta Lynch for that whole episode regarding her engagement and calling it a, quote, matter, not an investigation.  But with regard to this particular issue, I mean the tweet     theres nothing illegal or inappropriate about the tweet. If the tweet came on the heels of a Washington Post story that had five anonymous sources and didnt even identify the agency from which those sources came from, and thats what he tweet in response to. Its that simple, period. WALLACE: Final question, the president just     just added John Dowd, a   Washington lawyer, to his legal team. Should we expect him to hire other criminal lawyers? And, in a sense, is he preparing for a potential legal battle here? SEKULOW: Look, I mean John Dowd is     is a legal legend, you know that, in     in     in the     in Washington, D. C. and the president is doing the appropriate thing by hiring lawyers necessary, if there was to be an investigation, if there were to be an investigation, you have the lawyers in place. Weve got a great legal team led by Marc Kasowitz. Weve got John Dowd on the team. This is a solid team. Contrary to some of the press reports, a deep team, if necessary. WALLACE: Do you think     I     I     I misspoke. Im going to ask one more question. Because Im not allowed to ask you what the president thinks, do you think that he should stop     SEKULOW: Of course. WALLACE: Do you think he should stop tweeting about this case? SEKULOW: Look, I     heres the thing on that. You know, people have been asking me that. Look, the president has changed the way in which engagement goes in     I mean youve got great ratings, no doubt about it, Chris. But lets face it, the president speaks to 107 million people through his social media platforms. He revolutionized the election process by utilizing media in a different way. So I     I think, look, the president knows the effectiveness of social media. Hes been very effective at it. Again, Im his lawyer, I deal with the issues. Nothing that hes tweeted is causing me any issues whatsoever at this point. Nothing. WALLACE: Jay, thank you. Thanks for coming in. SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: Its always     its always interesting to talk to you. Please, come back, and well     SEKULOW: Thanks, Chris. WALLACE: Well continue it and maybe this time well get on this     you know what, be here in studio and we can stay on the same wavelength. SEKULOW: There we go. WALLACE: All right, sir     SEKULOW: Happy Fathers Day. WALLACE: Happy Fathers Day to you too, sir. Follow Pam Key on Twitter @pamkeyNEN"

Mark Kelly Renews Vow to Fight National Reciprocity After Shooting of Unarmed Congressman - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/18/2017,"On June 16, just two days after unarmed Republican house members were attacked in Alexandria, Virginia, gun control proponent Mark Kelly pledged to fight the national reciprocity legislation that would allow congressmen to be armed for  . [Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) was left in critical condition, and four others were also wounded when the attacker opened fire during Wednesdays congressional baseball practice. The gunman carried an assassination list in his pocket that contained the names of three GOP house members who were at the baseball practice.  GOP lawmakers responded to the shooting by stressing a renewed focus on national reciprocity, with some pointing out that they have concealed carry licenses but cannot keep guns with them because they have to drive into Washington D. C. which has draconian gun control laws. On Thursday, Rep. Thomas Massie ( ) sought to remedy this situation by introducing legislation that would that would force D. C. to recognize the carry permit of every state. In other words, D. C. would adopt national reciprocity. But on Friday, Kelly pledged to stop any effort to pass legislation that would allow   citizens to be armed in this fashion. Speaking to NPR, Kelly said he and his wife are fighting against concealed carry reciprocity.  He also vowed to fight efforts to remove   zones in schools.  He couched these statements amid a larger discussion of creating a safer society.  But the problem   as Wednesdays attack showed   is that barring   citizens from having guns with them for   only makes them vulnerable. Congressional baseball practice attendee Rep. Mike Bishop ( ) said it made them sitting ducks.  Kelly spoke in favor of passing universal background checks, claiming that background checks lower crime. He did not point out that the Alexandria attacker acquired his firearms from a Federal Firearm License (FFL) holder, which means he passed background checks to get them. Kelly also failed to note that his wife, Gabby Giffords, was shot by a man who passed a background check to acquire his gun.

"Elizabeth Warren to President Trump: Donald, You Aint Seen Nasty Yet - Breitbart",Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,6/18/2017,"On Friday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) stood on an empty New York stage, reading excerpts from her latest book, This Fight is Our Fight: The Battle to Save Americas Middle Class, and could hardly restrain her excitement while reading what sounded like a warning for President Donald Trump: Donald, you aint seen nasty yet. [Warren was reportedly reading some of her favorite   signs from the   Womens March in Boston, Massachusetts, when she said, And only one more because I have to discipline myself on this. This is a good sign: Donald, you aint seen nasty yet.    Warren was speaking at The Town Hall, a New York   performance space Friday evening. Those who chose to watch Warren read portions from her book and answer questions, instead of attending a rendition of Julius Caesar in which President Trump is killed off, could have paid $ $50 per ticket to do so. Another one of her favorite signs was reportedly, womens rights are not up for grabs.  In a video, she can be seen saying, What Donald Trump and the Republican majority in the House and the Senate want to do to us, is they want to deliver the knockout blow to the middle class.  Trumps Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin     a longtime donor to the Democratic Party     has stated that Trumps tax plan is meant to help the middle class and strengthen free market competition. The   senator and former Harvard law professor went on to say, The character of a nation is not the character of its president. The character of a nation is the character of its people.  Warren read a paragraph from her book that documented her emotion from the Womens March in the state she represents. As I marched in Boston with tens of thousands of others that day, I had no illusions. I knew it would be a hard fight. I knew there would be dark moments. But I knew that we had tens of millions of people with us, and this fight would be our fight.  Warren, who has said she wont run for president in 2020, recently said she hopes Republicans would leave their bodies to science because she would like to cut them open.  During a 2010 debate about proposals about how to fix the financial system, Warren said if a bill for a stronger consumer agency was not a possibility, she would choose no agency at all and plenty of blood and teeth left on the floor.  One year later, in an interview with MSNBCs Rachel Maddow, Warren said, And I have thrown rocks at people that I think are in the wrong.  She added, Ive done it before, Ive continued to do it, and Im going to do it in the future.  Adelle Nazarian is a politics and national security reporter for Breitbart News.

Senate Republicans Hope to Question Loretta Lynch on Conduct in Clinton Email Case,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/18/2017,"NEW YORK     Senate Republicans are eying the possibility of seeking testimony from former Attorney General Loretta Lynch over possible wrongdoing with regard to the FBIs criminal investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. [On Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ) sent a letter to Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, formally requesting that the committee probe any attempts to influence the FBIs investigations under the Trump and Obama administrations.  It is not immediately clear whether the Judiciary Committee, which oversees the Justice Department, has taken any action on the matter. A spokesman for Grassley, the Judiciary Committee chairman, told The Hill that although no decisions have been made, it is likely that Lynchs testimony to the Committee will become necessary at some point.   The spokesman explained that the Committee needs to first gather evidence.  Sen. John Cornyn ( ) a member of the Judiciary Committee, said it would be very helpful for Lynch to testify, The Hill reported. Frankly, a lot of what Hillary Clinton was exposed to by Director Comeys misconduct and the way he handled that was apparently in response to his lack of confidence in the attorney general, and I think there is a lot we could learn from that, Cornyn said. Sen. Lindsey Graham ( . C.) also expressed support for probing the accusations about Lynch. The accusations now that        the current and former attorney general were political     that has nothing to do with Russia as much as it has to do with how the Department of Justice is being run, he said. I want to find out all about that.  The Hill also quoted a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz ( ) explaining the former presidential candidate would absolutely back calls for Lynch to testify. President Trump himself tweeted about Lynch, accusing her of totally illegal activity. A. G. Lynch made law enforcement decisions for political purposes      gave Hillary Clinton a free pass and protection. Totally illegal!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2017,  How Russia Probe Exposes Loretta Lynch for Possible Wrongdoing in Clinton Email Case, There are three main issues surrounding Lynchs possible misdeeds in the Clinton email probe, as this reporter documented last week. One is Lynchs infamous tarmac meeting last June at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBIs main subject in a criminal probe     Hillarys email case     boarded the attorney generals plane and reportedly stayed there for about thirty minutes for a private chat. The second concern is Lynchs reported directive for   Director James Comey to publically refer to the FBIs criminal investigation into Clintons email as a matter instead of an investigation or a criminal probe. The language matched the specific rhetoric used at the time by Clintons 2016 presidential campaign, which referred to the criminal investigation as a matter.  The third issue relates to testimony and questions surrounding reports claiming that Comey was in possession of a document purportedly indicating that Lynch would ensure the Clinton email probe didnt go too far. Largely unreported by the news media, these questions surrounding Lynch are so serious that, in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee this month, Comey conceded that the appointment of a special counsel in the Clinton email case would have been appropriate due to his concerns about Lynch. Referring to Lynchs directive for Comey to call the criminal email probe a matter as well as her private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn asked the   chief the following pointed question: And under Department of Justice and FBI norms, wouldnt it have been appropriate for the attorney general, or, if she had recused herself     which she did not do     for the deputy attorney general to appoint a special counsel? Thats essentially whats happened now with Director Mueller. Would that have been an appropriate step in the Clinton   investigation, in your opinion? Yes, certainly a possible step, replied Comey. Yes, sir.  And in testimony in May, Comey expressed his concern that the [Justice Department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and declined prosecution without grievous damage to the American peoples confidence in the     in the justice system.  In a tweet last Thursday, President Trump brought up the issue of possible obstruction with Lynchs tarmac episode. Crooked H destroyed phones   hammer, bleached emails,  had husband meet   days before she was    they talk about obstruction?     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017,  Tarmac Trouble  The tarmac meeting was first reported by a local ABC affiliate in Phoenix, which asked Lynch about the incident at a   news conference at the Phoenix Police Department. Lynch confirmed to ABC15 in Phoenix that she did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane.  The local station quoted sources saying the meeting lasted about thirty minutes. Lynch claimed there was no discussion of State Department emails or any other matter pending before the Justice Department. She maintained that the conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix.  The tarmac meeting was first revealed by ABC15s Christopher Sign, who said that he was tipped off about the event by a trusted source.  Sign described a scene in which the FBI reportedly asked people at the tarmac not to take photographs. The FBI there on the tarmac instructed everybody: no photos, no pictures, no cell phones, Sign stated. The Obama White House postured to explain the meeting. Following the disclosure of the tarmac episode, President Obamas press secretary, Josh Earnest, felt the need to iterate Obamas stated commitment to avoiding political interference in Justice Department investigations. Judicial Watch raised the possibility of ethical and legal problems for Lynch. Attorney General Lynchs meeting with President Clinton creates the appearance of a violation of law, ethical standards and good judgment, the conservative government watchdog group said in a statement: Attorney General Lynchs decision to breach the   ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession is an outrageous abuse of the publics trust. Her conduct and statements undermine confidence in her ability to objectively investigate and prosecute possible violations of law associated with President Clinton and Secretary Clinton. The New York Times in April first reported that the tarmac incident solidified Comeys decision to go rogue, bypass the Justice Department and violate FBI tradition by holding a July 5, 2016, press conference to make conclusions on Clintons email case  At the gripping press event, which took place in the heat of the presidential campaign, Comey criticized Clintons private email server as extremely careless before finally stating that no charges are appropriate in this case.   Comey was widely criticized for going rogue instead of failing to seek Lynchs recusal on the Clinton case. His actions were cited in a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired. In his Senate testimony this month, Comey confirmed Lynchs tarmac meeting with Clinton capped his decision to make public the results of the FBI probe into Clintons emails. Referring to the tarmac meet, Comey stated, In an ultimately conclusive way, thats the thing that capped it for me that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation which meant both the FBI and the justice department.   The Matter The statement that the tarmac meeting served as a cap to Comeys decision to bypass Lynchs Justice Department in the email investigation indicates Comey had other concerns about Lynch. Indeed, in the same hearing, the next question posed to him by Republican Senator Richard Burr, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, focused precisely on that. Were there other things that contributed to that that you can describe in an open session? asked Burr. Comey replied: There were other things that contributed to that. One significant item I cant. I know the committees been briefed on. Theres been public accounts of it which are nonsense. But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. The only other consideration I can talk about in an open session, she told me to call it matter, which confused me and concerned me. But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if were to close this case credibly. Comeys one significant item seems to be a clear reference to the issue of a reported document allegedly indicating Lynch would interfere in the email probe to ensure it didnt go too far. Meanwhile, Comeys admission that Lynch told me to call it matter     a directive that confused and concerned him     serves as a significant public accusation against Lynch, possibly highlighting her intentions in the email probe. It is instrumental to recall that at the time, Clintons 2016 presidential campaign not only referred to the criminal email probe as a matter, Clintons official campaign website claimed the investigation was not a criminal inquiry. Lynch allegedly issued the matter directive to Comey despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal probe. In spite of Comeys stated concerns, he did call the investigation a matter in his public statements about the Clinton email case. The alleged Lynch directive was first revealed in the same extensive April 22 report in The New York Times.  The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspapers characterization, Lynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a matter.  The Times report continued: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word investigation would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clintons campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. I guess youre the Federal Bureau of Matters now, Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynchs motivations, he went along and did not call it a criminal investigation. I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch. Further raising questions about Lynch, in his Senate testimony this month, Comey lobbed a serious accusation about Lynchs intentions in the ordeal (emphasis added):  He stated:  And     and again, I dont know whether it was intentional or not, but it gave the impression that the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way a political campaign was describing the same activity, which was inaccurate. We had a criminal investigation open with     as I said before, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We had an investigation open at the time, and so that gave me a queasy feeling. Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Senates Judiciary Committee, commented on the seriousness of the alleged Lynch matter directive, speaking this past Sunday on CNNs State of the Union. I would have a queasy feeling too, though, to be candid with you, she told CNN about the issue. I think we need to know more about that, and theres only one way to know about it, and thats to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that.  At a Tuesday press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) stated that he wants to hear what Loretta Lynchs side of the story is before making any move regarding Lynch.  However, at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) grilled Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Downing about Lynchs alleged matter directive. Mr. Comey testified that former AG Loretta Lynch told him to, when he discussed the Clinton investigation, to call it a matter not an investigation, Jordan explained. Do you agree with that decision that was made?  Downing replied, I dont have an opinion one way or another on that.  Do you think its wise for the Justice Department to mislead the American people? Jordan shot back. Of course, the Justice Department should do its best not to mislead anyone, Downing retorted. I think what the American people would appreciate is their highest officials at the DOJ should be straight with the American people, Jordan added during the course of the exchange. And that did not happen.  Alleged Lynch Document, The issue of a possible document implicating Lynch is shrouded in conflicting news media reports and testimony implying that the matter has been presented in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The alleged document was first reported by The New York Times in the same extensive April report on Comey. According to that report, the FBI possessed information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the Clinton email probe. The newspaper described a document written by a Democratic operative that seemed     at least in the eyes of Mr. Comey and his aides     to raise questions about [Lynchs] independence.  The newspaper further described the reported document: During Russias hacking campaign against the United States, intelligence agencies could peer, at times, into Russian networks and see what had been taken. Early last year, F. B. I. agents received a batch of hacked documents, and one caught their attention. The document, which has been described as both a memo and an email, was written by a Democratic operative who expressed confidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far, according to several former officials familiar with the document. Read one way, it was standard Washington political chatter. Read another way, it suggested that a political operative might have insight into Ms. Lynchs thinking. While he was still FBI director, Comey was asked at a Senate hearing on FBI oversight in May about the about the purported Lynch document, and he refused to publicly address the matter, explaining it was an issue for a classified setting and not a public hearing.   After the issue of the purported document was raised at that hearing, the Washington Post released a story with an entirely different narrative on the alleged document. According to the Post report, the document     reportedly central to Comeys actions on the Clinton email probe     was assessed by Comeys own FBI to be unreliable and possibly fake. Comey seems to have pushed back against the Post report when he stated in his testimony this month (also referred to earlier in this article):  One significant item I cant. I know the committees been briefed on. Theres been public accounts of it which are nonsense. But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts.  And Sen. Lindsay Graham, who would have been present for classified testimony on the Russia probe, has publically stated that he doubted the purported Lynch document was fake. Regarding the Posts story on the alleged document, Graham stated on Face the Nation: I saw the Washington Post story. I doubt if its fake. Maybe it is. But I dont want to be briefed by myself. I want Democrats and Republicans on the judiciary to be briefed together. Our committee has been together and were going to stay together.  Graham further discussed the alleged document:  And I want Comey to come to our committee, because I know on two separate occasions, he has told members of the House and the Senate that the main reason he jumped into the election last year and took over the job of attorney general is because he believed there were emails between the Democratic National Committee and the Department of Justice that compromised the Department of Justice, and he thought the Russians were going to release these emails. Thats why he jumped in and took over Loretta Lynchs job. I want to know, is that true? According to the Posts account, the document in question was not a note written by a Democratic operative about Lynchs alleged loyalties to Clinton, as The Times reported. Instead, the Post claimed the memo was a Russian intelligence document that itself quoted secondhand from a purported email describing how Lynch told someone within the Clinton campaign that she would help to ensure that the Clinton email probe did not go too far. The document, according to the Post, cited an email said to have been written by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee. The alleged correspondence cited in the purported document was sent by Schultz to Leonard Benardo, who works at billionaire George Soross Open Society Foundations. The Post reported that the alleged Russian intelligence document merely cited some of the contents of the supposed Wasserman Schultz email to Benardo but did not actually contain a copy of the alleged message. According to the Posts characterization of the alleged document, Wasserman Schultz claimed Lynch had been in private communication with a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria during the campaign. The document indicated Lynch had told Renteria that she would not let the FBI investigation into Clinton go too far, according to people familiar with it.  Contacted by the Post, Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both said they do not know each other and never communicated.  Wasserman Schultz, Benardo, and Renteria told the Post that they were never interviewed by the FBI on the matter. The Post claimed that the FBI provided Lynch with a defensive briefing on the alleged document in which she was reportedly cooperative, in contrast to a report from this week describing a very different kind of meeting with Lynch. The Post reported: About a month after Comeys announcement, FBI officials asked to meet privately with the attorney general. At the meeting, they told Lynch about a foreign source suggesting she had told Renteria that Clinton did not have to worry about the email probe, because she would keep the FBI in check, according to people familiar with the matter. Just so you know, I dont know this person and have never communicated with her, Lynch told the FBI officials, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The FBI officials assured her the conversation was not a formal interview and said the document didnt have investigative value, the person said. Nevertheless, the officials said, they wanted to give the attorney general what is sometimes referred to as a defensive briefing     advising someone of a potential intelligence issue that could come up at some future point. Adding further intrigue to the Lynch document issue, this week Circa cited sources who were directly briefed on the matter, revealing that Comey briefed Congress on a frosty exchange that he says he had with Lynch centering on the purported document. Circas John Solomon and Sara A. Carter reported:  During the conversation, Comey told lawmakers he confronted Lynch with a highly sensitive piece of evidence, a communication between two political figures that suggested Lynch had agreed to put the kibosh on any prosecution of Clinton. Comey said the attorney general looked at the document then looked up with a steely silence that lasted for some time, then asked him if he had any other business with her and if not that he should leave her office, said one source who was briefed.  Comey took that interaction and the fact she had met with Bill Clinton as enough reason to decide he would not allow the Justice Department to decide the fate of the case and instead would go public with his own assessment that the FBI could not prove Mrs. Clinton intended to violate the law when she transmitted classified information through her private email and therefore should not be criminally charged.

HuffPost Slams Nervous Megyn for Softball Questions After Obtaining Unedited Putin Interview - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/18/2017,"NBC News Megyn Kelly cant get any love.  On Saturday, journalist Yashar Ali obtained an unedited video of Kellys interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the   HuffPost and promptly eviscerated the nervous Kelly for asking Putin softball questions. He wrote that the unedited footage shows a nervous Kelly who asked the authoritarian leader softball questions and failed to hold him accountable on key topics.  Most troubling, Kelly devoted precious time in her short interview to a question that led one former CIA Russia analyst to say that it sounded as if Putin had written the question himself, he continues. According to the HuffPost piece, the last question Kelly asked Putin, which was not aired, was startling in its pandering.  Kelly asks Putin in the unaired footage: We have been here in St. Petersburg for about a week now. And virtually every person we have met on the street says what they respect about you is they feel that you have returned dignity to Russia, that youve returned Russia to a place of respect. Youve been in the leadership of this country for 17 years now. Has it taken any sort of personal toll on you? A former CIA Russia analyst told HuffPost that the Kremlin could use Kellys interview for propaganda purposes: I cant begin to tell you what this did for Putins ego, and I wouldnt put it past the Kremlin to use it for propaganda purposes. Putins obsession is, by his definition, making Russia great again. Hes obsessed with the idea that he has returned the country to what he sees as the glory days of the USSR. He feels that since the breakup of the USSR, Russia has too often ceded ground where it shouldnt have. And hes obsessed with people seeing him as the one who brought dignity back to Russia. According to the HuffPost piece, Kellys questions were so weak and she missed so many opportunities that several network news reporters asked HuffPost the unthinkable: Did NBC News, in their negotiations with the Kremlin, agree to terms and conditions on questions or topics?  NBC sources reportedly confirmed that that there were no conditions, but the piece noted that a spokesman for NBC News declined to comment on Kellys choice of questions.  Though establishment media journalists patted Kelly on the head when she tried to undercut Donald Trump during the 2016 election cycle, they mostly slammed Kelly for being way out of her league after Putins interview. The Los Angeles Times noted that Kellys   interview was childs play for Putin, who outmaneuvered her as he displayed an elusive and ultimately dismissive demeanor toward Kelly.  According to the Times, Kellys   party delivered more of a fizzle than a bang.  The interview, which was teased for weeks on NBC as a   exclusive, lasted less than 10 minutes, the Times continued. But that was just about enough time to confirm that shes still not a great interviewer.  Yahoos Ken Tucker wrote that Putins a load of nonsense comment could have described most of the premiere of Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly.  He added that Kelly was no match for Putin. On the day before Kellys controversial interview with Alex Jones is set to air, HuffPost noted that multiple sources at NBC News have wondered if network executives misjudged Kellys skill set, popularity and savvy as a reporter.  A television executive reportedly told CNN that NBCs fundamental mistake was thinking that Kelly was a superstar.  The New York Times also doubted Kellys ability to do a   interview with Jones, pointing out that NBC has not released a transcript of Ms. Kellys interview, leading some to speculate that her interrogation of Mr. Jones over his more contentious views     for instance, that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government     was less than ferocious.  Despite all of the hype, Kelly has failed to deliver ratings for NBC. The debut of Kellys show could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes two weeks ago. Last Sunday, her second show tanked as well, losing to another rerun of 60 Minutes in addition to a rerun of Americas Funniest Home Videos. After just two shows, NBC executives are already reportedly freaking out over the ratings disaster that is Kelly."

"Box Office: Cars 3 Races Past Wonder Woman, Tupac Biopic Debuts Strong",Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/18/2017,"LOS ANGELES (AP)     Wonder Woman fell to second place in its third weekend in theaters, but its still doing the heavy lifting for the otherwise lackluster summer box office. [While many worn out franchises and franchise hopefuls continue to struggle to find a significant North American audience, smaller films such as the Tupac biopic All Eyez on Me and the shark thriller 47 Meters Down were able to break through the clutter and make a splash this weekend.  As expected, the third installment in Disney and Pixars $1 billion Cars franchise easily took the top spot, but its estimated $53. 5 million in earnings told a more complicated tale. Cars 3 had the worst opening in the series history     Cars opened to $60. 1 million and Cars 2 to $66. 1 million     and it was one of the lowest debut totals for the Pixar brand. It was also a disappointment compared with the top films over this weekend in 2015 and 2016, noted comScore senior media analyst Paul Dergarabedian. A year ago, Pixars Finding Dory debuted with $135. 1 million. In 2015, Jurassic World raked in $106. 6 million in its second weekend. That kind of tells you the state of the industry, Dergarabedian said. The   Cars 3 got an A CinemaScore and generally positive reviews, but it will have to contend with Despicable Me 3 which opens in two weeks. Wonder Woman was knocked down to second place with $40. 8 million, bringing its domestic total to $274. 6 million, while holdover The Mummy slid to fourth place in weekend two with $13. 9 million. Its been a challenging summer. I always say it comes down to product. Are the movies grabbing people? Dergarabedian said. Before Wonder Woman we were about 9 percent behind last summer. Were now at about even, but the industry would like to see better than even.  Amid the doldrums,   films were able to make a mark. The   Tupac biopic All Eyez on Me earned $27. 1 million to take third place on the charts. Despite largely negative reviews, audiences gave the film an   CinemaScore. Lionsgates Codeblack division marketed the pic, which cost Morgan Creek Productions around $40 million to produce. It opened to coincide with what would have been the late rappers 46th birthday on June 16. Its always nice to exceed expectations, said David Spitz, the president of theatrical distribution for Lionsgate. The Mandy Moore shark thriller 47 Meters Down also exceeded low expectations, earning $11. 5 million for a fifth place start. A C CinemaScore, however, could mean the pic is dead in the water going forward. The raunchy   comedy Rough Night is also facing some rough waters ahead with its ghastly C+ CinemaScore. The film, about a bachelorette party weekend gone wrong, starring Scarlett Johansson, Kate McKinnon and Jillian Bell, took in a paltry $8. 1 million against a $20 million production budget. Rough Night opened in seventh place, behind Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, which brought in $8. 5 million. The fifth Pirates film has earned $150. 1 million domestically and $500 million internationally. Next week, another fifth installment     Transformers: The Last Knight     opens. Dergarabedian expects it follow suit with most of the summers franchises and earn the bulk of its money abroad. Sometimes the bigger and better box office stories are not at No. 1, Dergarabedian said. All Eyez on Me and 47 Meters Down are the kind of movies people are looking for. It bodes well for Baby Driver and Atomic Blonde.  Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U. S. and Canadian theaters, according to comScore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. Cars 3, $53. 5 million. 2. Wonder Woman, $40. 8 million. 3. All Eyez on Me, $27. 1 million. 4. The Mummy, $13. 9 million. 5. 47 Meters Down, $11. 5 million. 6. Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales, $8. 5 million. 7. Rough Night, $8. 1 million. 8. Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie, $7. 4 million. 9. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, $5 million. 10. It Comes At Night, $2. 6 million."
"London Terror: One Dead, One Arrested as Man Ploughs Van into Pedestrians Outside London Mosque",Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/18/2017,"London police are investigating a suspected terror attack and have arrested a 48 year old on suspicion of attempted murder after a van was driven into a crowd of people on a London street near a mosque in Finsbury Park. Eyewitnesses have said the man got out of the vehicle and shouted I want to kill all Muslims. [One died during the attack and 10 were injured, but it is unclear whether the death was caused directly by the van ploughing into the crowd. Police said in a statement overnight that all the victims of the attack were from the Muslim faith.  Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick said in a statement Monday morning: London has woken up to the news of another appalling attack on our city. My thoughts are with the family of the man who has died and with all those who were injured. My officers were on the scene almost immediately, and other uniformed and specialist officers quickly arrived to support them. They worked quickly with colleagues from the other emergency services to treat the injured. I want to thank all those members of the public who assisted police and emergency services in our task. There is now an ongoing investigation by our Counter Terrorism Command to establish why this attack was carried out. London is a city of many faiths and many nationalities. An attack on one community is an attack on all of us. Terrorists will not succeed in their attempts to divide us and make us live in fear.  Extra officers are on duty in the area to help reassure the local community. They will be there for as long as they are needed. Communities will see additional officers patrolling across the city and at Muslim places of worship. We are working as hard as we can to protect all our communities, and we will not be defeated. In a separate statement, police said the attack happened while a man was already receiving first aid from the public at the scene and that this was the individual who had died. Because it was unclear whether the man had already died before the attack took place, police said Any causative link between his death and the attack will form part of our investigation. It is too early to state if his death was as a result of the attack. No matter what the motivation proves to be, and we are keeping an open mind, this is being treated as a terrorist attack and the Counter Terrorism Command is investigating.  Speaking to Sky News Monday, Miqdaad Versi, assistant   of the Muslim Council of Britain described the moments leading up to the attack. He said: This was a group of individuals who were praying at the Muslim Welfare House. They were just coming back from prayers and one individual happened to collapse on the floor, and people who wanted to help that individual came around him to support him, and at that moment in time thats when the van mounted the curb and attacked that whole group, and resulted in that one injury that were aware of.  Previous reports that there had been multiple individuals in the van, and that the driver was carrying a knife have not been confirmed by police Monday morning. The Finsbury Park Mosque outside which the attack took place had just let out after Taraweeh     special,   Ramadan prayers. Prime Minister Theresa May has described the attack as a terrible incident while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he is shocked by the awful event. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) said in a statement: We should make clear that if this attack is confirmed as a deliberate terrorist attack then this should be classed as an act of terrorism. The British Muslim community requires all decent people to stand with us against this evil violence. Rampant Islamaphobia [sic] has been on the rise for a number of years and those on the far right have perpetuated hatred against Muslims. They should be called out for their hatred. The days ahead will be difficult, but with unity and tolerance we will prevail. We will not allow these far right extremists to divide our diverse communities. Enough is enough, my condolences and prayers for all the victims and their families. They are in my prayers.  The salafist Finsbury Park mosque has previously been in the news as having been the home of famed hate preacher Abu Hamza Al Masri, as well as having   attacker Zacarias Moussaoui and shoe bomber Richard Reid as attendees. In recent years the mosque has changed its management team and has not been mentioned in connection with any recent terror plots.

BuzzFeed News (@BuzzFeedNews) June 19, 2017,  London Ambulance Service Deputy Director of Operations, Kevin Bate said: We were called at 12. 15am to reports of a road traffic collision at Seven Sisters Road. We have sent a number of ambulance crews, advance paramedics and specialist responses teams to the scene. An advance trauma team from Londons Air Ambulance has also been dispatched by car. We are working closely with other members of the emergency services at the scene. Our priority is to assess the level and nature of injuries and ensure those in the most need are treated first and taken to hospital. More information will follow when we have it."
UK Chancellor: Cladding on Grenfell Tower banned on high-rises,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,6/18/2017,"London (CNN) A senior UK government minister said Sunday that he believed the cladding apparently used in a recent refurbishment of the London   devastated by a blaze is banned in Britain for buildings above a certain height. Speculation has focused on the role that may have been played by the cladding since the fire tore through the   Grenfell Tower in the early hours of Wednesday, leaving at least 58 people presumed dead. The government on Saturday promised a public inquiry and police have opened a criminal investigation. But angry residents, many of whom lost everything they had in the blaze, have voiced fears of a  . My understanding is the cladding in question, this flammable cladding which is banned in Europe and the US, is also banned here, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond told the BBCs The Andrew Marr Show. So there are two separate questions. One, are our regulations correct, do they permit the right kind of materials and ban the wrong kind of materials? The second question is were they correctly complied with? That will be a subject that the inquiry will look at. It will also be a subject that the criminal investigation will be looking at. A spokesman for the Department for Communities and Local Government told CNN that the use of a composite aluminum panel with a polyethylene core would breach current UK building regulations guidance, which says this material should not be used as cladding on buildings over 18 meters (59 feet) in height. However, the spokesman did not confirm what type of cladding was used on Grenfell Tower, adding that this would be subject to investigation.  The company that installed the cladding, Harley Facades Limited, said in a statement Wednesday that it was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower. No sprinkler system, Police said Saturday that 30 people had been confirmed dead since the fire, while another 28 remain missing and are presumed dead. Nineteen people remained in hospital as of Saturday afternoon, of whom 10 were receiving critical care. The towers cladding will likely be one of only many factors taken into account as investigators probe what happened.  Authorities have also faced questions about why the tower block, built in the 1970s, was never subsequently fitted with a sprinkler system that might have saved lives as the blaze took hold. But Hammond said it was up to the public inquiry to determine whether the retrofitting of sprinklers to buildings was necessary to improve fire safety.  What I am hearing from the leading fire safety experts is that it isnt necessarily necessary to retrofit sprinklers to make a building fire safe, he told the BBC. If something needs to be done to make buildings safe it will be done. Councilor Nicholas   told the BBC this week that sprinklers were not fitted inside the building during the refurbishment because that would have delayed and made the refurbishment of the block more disruptive.  MP: Survivors treatment appalling Labour politician David Lammy called Friday for corporate manslaughter charges to be brought over the Grenfell Tower disaster and wrote to Londons Metropolitan Police urging them to ensure that those responsible for the refurbishment were held to account. Lammy, who represents Tottenham in north London, has also expressed concerns that vital evidence concerning the refurbishment might be destroyed or lost before it can be seized by police. In a series of tweets Sunday, the lawmaker said survivors wanted greater transparency. Trust is very, very low. Contractors are removing Grenfell details from their websites. What else are they deleting? he asked.  I was with the Grenfell survivors last night. They want answers, not a   from the council and contractors. Lammy, who lost a friend in the fire    talented young artist Khadija Saye    also said that the residents treatment by the authorities had been absolutely appalling, with volunteers stepping in to help instead. Corbyn slams response, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn added his voice Sunday to a mounting chorus of criticism over officials response to the fire. Corbyn told ITVs Peston on Sunday that the local council, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, was failing to provide effective help for people made homeless by the fire    despite being the wealthiest local authority in the country. Four hundred or so people    still most of them have not got somewhere decent or safe or secure to stay, he said. Somehow or other it seems to be beyond the wit of the public services to deal with the crisis facing a relatively small number of people in a country of 65 million. The Labour Party is Britains main opposition party. Corbyns comments come a day after Conservative Prime Minister Theresa May said support for families in the initial aftermath of the Grenfell Tower fire was not good enough and announced a fund of 5 million pounds ($6. 4 million) to help those affected by the blaze. The borough said Friday that all residents of Grenfell Tower who had asked for help had been housed in hotels and that it was looking for interim accommodation for those people and others living nearby who could not return home. We want to rehouse people in a good home as quickly as we can, it said. Church service, Scores of people attended a service Sunday morning at the nearby Notting Hill Methodist Church, at which tribute was paid to those impacted by the fire. A message from the churchs president, Roger Walton, read out to the congregation, said his prayers were with local people, adding: You are a symbol of hope in the dark days.  Outside, many people lit candles and added flowers to banks of bouquets piled against the church walls. Posters appealing for help to find missing loved ones remain pinned to a green door, the smiling faces of those pictured standing in contrast to the somber mood. Around the corner, volunteers offered counseling to those traumatized by the disaster and handed out donated food and water to those in need. London Mayor Sadiq Khan tweeted that he had attended an incredibly moving service at St. Clements Church, also close by, and that it was an honor to stand alongside the community to pray for the fire victims. Speaking after the memorial service, Khan called the fire a preventable accident that didnt need to happen. He said the local community was frustrated and angry about years of neglect from the local council and successive national governments.  There is a feeling from the community of theyve been treated badly because some of them are poor, some of them may come from deprived backgrounds, some of them may be asylum seekers and refugees, Khan said. The government has said the country will observe a moment of silence at 11 a. m. Monday in remembrance of the victims."
Trump Attorney: The President Is Not Under Investigation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/18/2017,"Jay Sekulow, one of the attorneys representing President Donald Trump, told several Sunday morning news shows that Trump is not under investigation. [Sekulow, who is also Chief Counsel of the American Center for Law  Justice (ACLJ) appeared on both NBC News Meet the Press and CNNs State of the Union to counter mainstream media reports that the president is officially under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller for obstruction of justice.  Former FBI director James Comey told the president three times that he was not under investigation for collusion with Russia, but would not reveal that information to the public. That fact that only emerged publicly once the president fired him and suggested publicly that he might have tapes of their conversations. On Friday, the president tweeted: I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.  I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017, The media widely interpreted that statement as an admission that Trump was under investigation for obstruction of justice for firing Comey. But Sekulow told the Sunday shows that Trump was referring only to claims made by the Washington Post that he was under investigation, and that he had no reason to believe he was actually being investigated. As James Comey said in his testimony, and as we know as of today     the president has not been, and is not, under investigation [for obstruction], Comey told NBCs Chuck Todd. youre reading more to the tweet than whats there, Sekulow said, noting that the Post had relied on five anonymous, unnamed sources from unnamed agencies.  Sekulow repeated that message on CNN, telling host Jake Tapper: Let me be clear: The president is not under investigation        The president is not the subject or target of an investigation.  He also called the Post story a fake report.  Update: On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace asked Sekulow whether Trump had been notified by Mueller that he was under investigation. Sekulow said that he had not. However, confusion erupted when Sekulow suggested that Trumps tweet referred to the Department of Justice, adding, Hes being investigated.  Wallace chalenged Sekulow on that point, whereupon Sekulow clarified again: We have not received nor are we aware of any investigation of the President of the United States.  Sir, you just said two times that hes being investigated, Wallace replied. Sekulow answered that he had simply been describing the legal theory under which the president would be investigated, if he were, which Sekulow denied he was. He added that he could not read Muellers mind. Wallace then suggested that Sekulow did not actually know if Trump was being investigated. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Italians Rejoice as Soros Ally Mayor Awarded UN Prize for Welcoming Migrants Kicked Out of Office,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,6/18/2017,"Italians this week cheered the electoral defeat of a mayor who signed a deal with George Soros to turn the tiny island of Lampedusa into a gateway to Europe for migrants travelling from Africa. [Thank you, you have eradicated the Lampedusa cancer, read graffiti sprayed across walls on several streets of the small island with just 6, 000 residents after voters ousted Mayor Giusi Nicolini.  The Lampedusa native was kicked into third place at local elections Sunday, locals electing businessman Salvatore Tot Martello, who said during the campaign that he cannot stand seeing migrants swarming everywhere. Since taking office in 2012 the outgoing mayor transformed the island into a gateway to Europe, streamlining migrant processing to enable Lampedusas reception centre to process and give shelter to 700 asylum seekers at a time,  moving most of them on to Sicily or the Italian mainland. Nicolini, who has used her status as a public figure to repeatedly promote open borders and acceptance of mass migration to Europe, was two months ago awarded the UNESCO Peace Prize for her boundless humanity and unwavering commitment to refugee crisis management and integration. And in October last year, the decorated mayor attended dinner with Barack Obama at the White House, brought along by Italys   Minister, the unelected technocrat Matteo Renzi, as one of the people who represented the best of Italy. Following Nicolinis defeat, conservative activists joyfully posted altered images representing the former mayor as an illegal immigrant expelled from the country and memes claiming she is an agent of George Soros, according to the Washington Post, which described the Hungarian billionaire as the liberal tycoon whom conspiracy theorists accuse of being behind the wave of African immigration to Europe.  The outgoing mayor rushed to destroy and delete files, documents, private correspondence and entire folders from computers in her office upon her electoral defeat, telling the media: No, I do not have time to respond to Martello, my priorities lie elsewhere.  Questioning her haste in clearing the mayoral office, several Italian websites pointed to documents that emerged in 2014 which showed Nicolini signed a memorandum of understanding with Open Society Initiative for Europe (OSIFE) in which the   agreed to let Soros international funding network help strengthen Lampedusas capacity [to take migrants] and promote the islands population and its guests.  Noting how, with so many African migrants arriving on boats, Lampedusa operates in a state of chronic emergency the OSIFE document asserts the island will require manpower and expertise to complement its current workforce.  Under the terms of the agreement, the funding body sent personnel to Lampedusa who set up humanitarian and cultural projects on the island,. The agreement does not provide direct financing, the document states, explaining that OSIFE will provide the service via a person on the island with skills suitable for the purpose, and adding that funds allocated to Lampedusa will be sent to specific bank accounts which must be used specifically for projects promoting mass migration. Last year, leaked OSIFE documents revealed Soros proclaimed that mass migration to Europe should be accepted as a new normal carrying with it new opportunities for the billionaires cash to influence immigration policies on a global scale."
The secret negotiations behind the Hong Kong handover,CNN,James Griffiths,6/18/2017,"Hong Kong (CNN) The two leaders sat several feet apart at a long table covered in green silk.  Between them, a tiny twin flagpole bore the standards of the United Kingdom and the Peoples Republic of China.  The crowd behind applauded as British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang signed large   documents with black fountain pens and then shook hands.  With that, on December 19, 1984, the end of more than 150 years of British rule over Hong Kong was sealed and a timeline put in place for China to assume sovereignty over the city on July 1, 1997. The people of Hong Kong were not party to the discussions, nor were they consulted about the final decision, which had a profound effect on their futures and freedoms.   Treaty territory, The UK acquired the territory that is now Chinas Hong Kong Special Administrative Region via three treaties. Following the defeat of the Qing Empire in the first and second opium wars (in 1842 and 1860 respectively) the territories of Hong Kong and Kowloon were ceded to the UK.  In 1898, London agreed to lease what became known as the New Territories from the Qing, drastically expanding the amount of land governed by the Hong Kong colony, but also setting in motion the end of British rule.  While the Qing Empire    and its successors, the Republic of China and the Peoples Republic of China    had given up claims for Hong Kong and Kowloon, the lease for the New Territories was set to expire on 30 June 1997.  We can only maintain sovereign powers in the New Territories up to 1997 in any case and the rest of the territory is not viable on its own, a 1982 UK Foreign Office memo warned Thatcher. In his memoirs, David      chief secretary of Hong Kong from 1985 to 1987    wrote that following the war and the gradual collapse of the British Empire, Hong Kong recognized that the uncertain future would last until it was known what would happen when the lease of most of the colony, the New Territories, expired. That future would not include independence, as it did for most other British colonies. After the Peoples Republic of China joined the United Nations in 1971, Beijing successfully pushed for Hong Kong (along with neighboring Macau, then a Portuguese colony) to be removed from a list of    territories for whom all steps were to be taken by the UN to enable them to enjoy complete independence and freedom.  Secret talks, In 1982, Thatcher visited Beijing, becoming the first UK Prime Minister to enter Communist China, and formally established negotiations on the future of Hong Kong.  Initially, London hoped to maintain significant control over the city, even if it ceded legal sovereignty to China.  In secret discussions among Thatchers cabinet    since declassified    it was suggested land leases in the New Territories could be converted to indefinite ones in order to make it possible for British administration to continue beyond 1997 if the Chinese so wish.  That proposal was rejected by Beijing as unnecessary and inappropriate in what British ambassador to China Sir Percy Cradock described in a September 1979 memo as a disappointing reply.  As Thatcher prepared to visit Beijing three years later, a briefing document prepared for her said there will be strong expectations that Hong Kongs future will be discussed, if not decided during her time there. Despite this however, UK Foreign Ministry officials were still operating on the basis that British administration, if not rule, would continue. Confidence in the territory, particularly among investors, is likely only to be maintained if autonomy is guaranteed by the administration continuing on the same lines, i. e. through the British, a March 1982 memo said.  British law requires most cabinet documents to be declassified   years after they were initially created. While the documents do quote Chinese officials extensively, few accounts of Beijings side of the negotiations have been made public.   Prosperity vs stability, By April 1982, the future legality of Hong Kong was starting to come into place.  In a meeting between former British Prime Minister Edward Heath and Chinese paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, Deng said that a new Chinese constitution would specifically allow for the creation of special administrative zones, where different legal and economic systems could operate. Heath said that Britain received nothing from Hong Kong and suggested that Britain managed Hong Kong for the benefit of China and of mankind, Cradock wrote in a secret memo to Thatcher.  Around this time, Deng put forward the principle that now governs Hong Kong, of one country, two systems, by which the city would retain its capitalist economy and limited democratic freedoms, but sovereignty would pass to Beijing.  On September 23, 1982, Thatcher met with Zhao Ziyang at the Great Hall of the People. (Zhao) said that there were two principles (at stake)    sovereignty, and the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, a record of the meeting said. If it came to a choice between the two, China would put sovereignty above prosperity and stability.  The following day, Thatcher met with Deng, during which the old revolutionary warned her in no more than one or two years time the Chinese government would formally announce their decision to recover Hong Kong. Talks continued after Thatcher left Beijing, and would eventually result in the   Joint Declaration that she and Zhao signed on that day in 1984.  No consultation, Throughout the discussions held by Thatchers cabinet, the chief concerns expressed in the secret memos were retaining market confidence in Hong Kong, and avoiding a situation like the Falklands, over which Britain went to war with Argentina in 1982.  Emily Lau, former chairwoman of the Hong Kong Democratic Party, said Hong Kongers knew that all (the British) cared about was trade . .. and the well being of the Hong Kong people was of secondary importance.  She too pointed to the Falklands, but to make a very different point. There were only 1, 800 people and hundreds of thousands of sheep on the islands, Lau said, but nevertheless the Falklanders were given a seat at the table in negotiations between the UK and Argentina during the 1970s, before the failed Argentine invasion of 1982. By comparison, Hong Kongers could not play any part in handover talks, though they were involved after the deal was done in drafting the citys   Basic Law. The British and Chinese governments had already jointly decided to impose their agreement on the territory and were not willing to make amendments to it, according to historian Ian Scott. Last ditch efforts in 1983 of Hong Kong legislators to represent the views of the city    which largely did not favor rule by China    were fruitless.  While Hong Kongers were invited to publicly comment on the negotiations, the secret nature of them made doing so nigh impossible.  Both the Chinese and British governments have openly invited the people of Hong Kong to express their views, lawmaker Wong Lam said in a session of the citys parliament in March 1984. Yet how can they express their views if they have very little or no knowledge of what is going on?  Push and pull, The treatment of Hong Kongers during the negotiations has left a great deal of residual anger towards the British from parts of the citys   movement.  I think the British have a lot to answer for, Lau said. (Both in) not giving us democratic elections, and not allowing Hong Kong British citizens to go and live in the UK. We were third class citizens. After signing the treaty, Thatcher visited Hong Kong, where Lau, a journalist at the time, accused her of delivering over five million people into the hands of a Communist dictatorship.  Thatcher responded that Britain had done everything we could for Hong Kong, adding that Lau was likely the only person in the city unhappy with the deal.  Declassified documents from long before handover negotiations even began show that some British officials did seek to introduce more democracy in Hong Kong but were angrily rebuffed by Beijing.  Allowing Hong Kong people to govern themselves would be a very unfriendly act, premier Zhou Enlai reportedly told British officials in 1958. Another Chinese official in 1960 threatened potential invasion if the UK attempted to introduce greater democracy to the colony.  Chris Patten, the last colonial governor, did expand the amount of directly elected lawmakers in a 1995 parliamentary vote, over vociferous complaints from Beijing and promises to replace the newly returned legislature with an appointed body. It was the first and last time the city has had a majority   parliament.  On July 1, 1997, after Patten sailed away on the yacht Britannia, the elected legislators sneaked onto the balcony of the citys parliament building. Speaking to a large crowd below, Democratic Party Chairman Martin Lee and his colleagues promised the crowd they would return.  The flame of democracy has been ignited and is burning in the hearts of our people, he said. It will not be extinguished."
LGBT Rights Groups Slam Trump Admin Fathers Day Event with Traditional Marriage Advocates - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/18/2017,"Gay rights advocates have condemned the Trump education department for inviting groups that advocate for one   woman marriage to a Fathers Day event.

Shes Not Mean. Shes Just Being Kamala. - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/18/2017,"Former San Francisco mayor Willie Brown has offered an odd defense of Sen. Kamala Harris ( ) whose habit of interrupting Cabinet members during Senate hearings     and being rebuked by the chair     has made her a heroine on the left. [Democrats and the media have turned Harris into a symbol of The Universal Phenomenon of Men Interrupting Women, as a New York Times article put it     utterly ignoring the fact that she was interrupting others.  Critics have charged that Harris     who interrupted Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, and did it again the next day to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein     is staging the confrontations for notoriety and donations. Brown suggests in his San Francisco Chronicle column that some on the left are also privately uneasy about the conduct of the freshman Senator, who some Democrats already hope will be a presidential candidate in 2020: Supporters of Sen. Kamala Harris have been calling me to ask if shes coming across as too strident in her questioning of Justice Department officials testifying before the Intelligence Committee. You know, she seems kind of mean, one caller said. Shes not mean, I said. Shes just being Kamala.  Unlike many politicians, Harris did not work her way up the ladder in the   world of city councils and the Legislature. She came into the Senate via the courthouse, first as a   prosecutor and then district attorney in San Francisco, followed by six years as state attorney general. She is a   prosecutor, and when she goes into that mode, watch out. She is out for blood. Brown goes on to say: Harris doesnt care about Senate courtesy. She has no interest in being in their club.

Brooks Koepka Wins First Major at U.S. Open - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel Redmond,6/18/2017,"ERIN, Wis.   Brooks Koepka proved too big, too strong, and too tough for both the course and his competitors, firing a final round 67 to run away with the 2017 U. S. Open. [Koepka overpowered the lengthy Erin Hills track and separated himself from the field after birdieing holes 14, 15, and 16. After that thunder strike, it was a coronation for a player who is living up to high expectations placed on him since he turned professional. The biggest disappointment was the lack of drama over the closing holes as early in the day it looked like it would be a photo finish among numerous golfers.  From the start, Koepka imposed his will on the course birdieing the first two holes to take a lead he would never relinquish. His drove long and straight and his approach shots, when tracked by the Fox shot tracker, seemed to align with the digital pin position. His accuracy and distance was a sight to behold. A   All American at Florida State, Koepka took the unusual route of starting his career on the European tour. After a couple of victories in Europe, he won his first title on the PGA tour with a win at the 2015 Waste Management Open. Koepka flew under the radar coming into the championship, with most prognosticators picking the other American big hitter in Dustin Johnson. Koepka put together four solid rounds of 67, 70, 68, and 67 to tie the lowest score ever in the U. S. Open at   par.   favorite Rickie Fowler again failed to score when he needed it most. Reminiscent of the 2014 PGA and 2017 Masters, Fowler just never got his round going and bogeys on 12 and 15 put him out of contention. When Rickie wins one, there will be a big celebration because so many people are rooting for him. Brian Harman hung in there for 13 holes before being run over by the Koepka freight train. Harmon had relied on precision ball striking and pinpoint putting, but that abandoned him on the back nine and he finished at an even par 72. Koepka was subdued when he sank the winning putt, giving only   fist bump. He seemed a little overwhelmed when being carted to the scoring area with girlfriend Jena Sims. In his champions interview with Curtis Strange, he opened up and talked about his mindset coming into Sunday and the most important golf round of his life. I felt like I was playing really good, he noted. Obviously, the wind picked up and I felt like that played right into my hands   good   good putter. And I felt confident all week. So, to feel as confident as I did on a Sunday of a major and coming down the stretch was pretty neat.  Koepka will not be a   wonder when it comes to winning big golf tournaments. In fact, this win could kickstart an excellent career. Brooks Koepka hits the ball too far and too straight to become an   on the PGA Tour. Look for big things to come from this big man."
Elon Musk wants to link computers to our brains to prevent an existential threat to humanity,Business Insider,Kevin Loria,6/18/2017,"Elon Musk is a busy guy.

Given Musks ambitiousness, its not totally surprising that   he is also  that will look into ways to link human   brains to computers. Musk reportedly  on  which will develop   technology to integrate brains and computers as a way   to fix medical problems and eventually supercharge human   cognition.     Existing   interfaces, which are relatively   simple compared to Muskss goals, can connect to a few hundred   brain cells at a time. Those are . Once researcher are able to understanding and   connect interfaces to the 100 billion neurons in the brain, these   linkages could essentially .     That potential has clearly captured Musks interest, but this new   project also seems to stem from his concerns about     artificial intelligence (AI).   of  has a  that gives him unique access to   insight into the tech mogul. Urban suggests Musk is betting on   the possibility that melding human and artificial   intelligence will make us more likely to survive the   emergence of   (and  ) AI.     Urban wrote an excellent 38, 000 word  and AIs existential threat to humanity, but   he gave a short version of this idea to author Virginia   Heffernan in a      The threat Urban is referring to is that AI could in theory   lead to intelligent machines that become exponentially smarter   than humans. In the hands of a bad or insane actor     or in a   situation in which AI were to somehow go rogue     that could pose   an existential threat to humanity.     Musk isnt the only one with these fears     people like Stephen   Hawking and Bill Gates .         Connecting our own brains to the digital world, however,   could allow individual humans to make use of the same sort   of computing power and intelligence. In that case, thered   be many equally intelligent and powerful actors out there.   Basically anyone with sufficient means and desire to harness   the power of AI could do so. In that sense, Musks venture could   be seen as a sort of mass deterrence system.     Musk sees the emergence of AI as inevitable, and   has another  to develop a safe path towards artificial   intelligence. But the rise of   AI is most   likely still far away.       interfaces still have a ways to go, too. The   relatively simple systems that already exist can send   movement signals to prosthetic arms, or function as ears or eyes   for people unable to see or hear. But more complex interfaces   could one day allow the brain to directly connect to the cloud or   to the mind of another person in a given network. Urban   mentions these applications as potential   goals, though   theyre completely beyond modern technology.     In fact, were still in the early stages of understanding the   brain, which  chief scientific officer of the Allen   Institute for Brain Science, has described as the most   complex object in the universe.     Furthermore, even if the technology were to become available,   most Americans are not enthusiastic about brain computer   interfaces,  by Pew.     But as Musk sees it, were closer to that future than we think.     We already have a digital tertiary layer in a sense, in that you   have your computer or your phone or your applications, Musk told   Urban. The thing that people, I think, dont appreciate right   now is that they are already a cyborg. Youre already a different   creature than you would have been twenty years ago, or even ten   years ago . .. If you leave your phone behind, its like   missing limb syndrome.     Musk also told Urban that he thinks healthy people will be able   to start using some sort of   interface for   cognitive enhancement within the next 8 to 10 years. If that   happens, the minds working on understanding our own brain and   trying to develop new  interfaces will grow even   smarter, quicker, and more powerful.  Elon Musk is a busy guy. Hes. .."
German Government Holds Out Hope For Soft Brexit,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/18/2017,"BERLIN (AP)     Germanys foreign minister says there may now be a chance of a soft British exit from the European Union that keeps the U. K. in the blocs single market, but is warning that Britain couldnt pick and choose its conditions. [Brexit negotiations start on Monday, with question marks over Britains approach after Prime Minister Theresa May lost her parliamentary majority in an election meant to strengthen her hand in the talks.  German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Sundays Welt am Sonntag newspaper that maybe there is now a chance to achieve a   soft Brexit.  But he said staying in the single market would require Britain to accept EU workers freedom of movement. It also would have to accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, or at least a joint court that is staffed by Europeans and Britons and in principle follows the ECJs rulings, Gabriel said. For many Brexit advocates, those conditions would be impossible to accept as last years referendum campaign focused on getting back control over laws and immigration from the EU. Gabriel said it would naturally be best if Britain didnt leave at all.  It doesnt look like that at the moment, he added. But we want to keep the door open for the British.  The   Social Democrat strongly criticized Mays Conservatives, saying that they played with the emotions of citizens in Britain, told fake news about Europe and left people unclear about what consequences this would all have.  Referring to the difficult, even impossible situation created by the indecisive election, he added: here, those who created such chaos would have long since gone.  We will negotiate fairly, Gabriel was quoted as saying. And fair means that we want to keep the British as close as possible to the EU     but never at the price that we divide the remaining 27 EU states."
"NY Times Op-Ed: Deport Americans, Invite Migrants - Breitbart",Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/18/2017,"America belongs to immigrants because immigrants make the nation more powerful, says a former Wall Street Journal writer who is now working for the New York Times. [Immigrants produce more babies, work harder, create more jobs, and have more ideas, claims the revealing column by   Bret Stephens:  I speak of Americans whose families have been in this country for a few generations. Complacent, entitled and often shockingly ignorant on basic points of American law and history, they are the stagnant pool in which our national prospects risk drowning       Bottom line:   real Americans are screwing up America. Maybe they should leave, so that we can replace them with new and better ones: newcomers who are more appreciative of what the United States has to offer, more ambitious for themselves and their children, and more willing to sacrifice for the future. In other words, just the kind of people we used to be     when we had just come off the boat       Stephens article includes several    statistical flubs, plus grotesque generalizations, and regurgitated   agitprop. For example, Stephens says the United States is a country of immigrants even though roughly 84 percent of people living in the United States were born in the United States     despite the   huge influx of immigrants over the last few decades. Similarly, Stephens treats immigrants as a uniform mass, as if he believes that migrating   gang members are as beneficial as are   inventors. But the articles main feature is the progressive view that people     Americans, foreigners,   whatever     should be selected by the   State to serve the States   progressive leadership class in D. C. and Wall Street. That view is shared by former President Barack Obama, who told supporters in November 2014 that: Sometimes we get attached to our particular tribe, our particular race, our particular religion, and then we start treating other folks differently. And that, sometimes, has been a bottleneck to how we think about immigration.  If you look at the history of immigration in this country, each successive wave, there have been periods where the folks who were already here suddenly say, Well, I dont want those folks     even though the only people who have the right to say that are some Native Americans. That   view allows Stephens to ignore the Declaration of Independence which declared that peoples rights came from a higher source than government:  We hold these truths to be   that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  The elitist view also allows Stephens to welcome mass immigration because     not despite, but because     it hugely distorts the nations economy in favor of elite business leaders and major cities. Mass immigration spikes profits and stock values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor offered by   and   employees, drives up real estate prices, reduces   investment, increases state and local tax burdens, and sidelines marginalized Americans and their families.  Mass immigration also imposes the social diversity which helps Stephens and his allies as they claim a Darwinian right to fragment, divide and rule Americans without any rude interference by the voters on November 8, 2016. In contrast, President Donald Trump won his 2016 campaign on a promise to put Americans first. He told his inauguration listeners that he would hold to a policy of Buy American, Hire American, he has started enforcing immigration laws and is pushing for a   immigration plan that would raise the productivity and wealth of Americans.

T.J. Miller: Role of Comedy Changed with This Motherf***er in the White House,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/18/2017,"Actor and   comedian T. J. Miller believes that the roles of entertainers have changed drastically with the election of President Donald Trump. [In an interview with the Wrap this week, the Silicon Valley star     whose first HBO   special, Meticulously Ridiculous, premiered Saturday     said his whole approach to his craft has changed now that Trump, whom he called this mother***er in the White House, was elected in November.  It used to be different     before it was, What is absurdist? Then this mother***er in the White House totally changed everything for everyone, the    actor told the outlet. Immediately after the election, Kumail Nanjiani was walking around the set of Silicon Valley saying, Everythings changed now     standup, everything. Now, I have a political obstacle to a social mission, and the f*ckery that must be dealt with, he added. Miller has previously spoken out against the president during his hosting gig at the Critics Choice Awards in December, the actor joked that trolls did well in 2016, not the movie, but the dudes on the Internet, adding: One of them got elected president.  Miller also stood on an actual soap box for a segment about how celebrities should stick to doing their jobs instead of trying to opine on politics. All I want to do is talk about whats going on in the world, but the problem is, I hate when celebrities get on their soap box, Miller said. Just do your act. Dont tell the rest of us how to think, O. K.? A few days before the awards show, the Office Christmas Party actor was arrested after allegedly slapping an Uber driver during what was reported to be an argument between the two about    Trump. While a large number of Hollywood stars have taken their political activism to new heights since Trumps election, not every celebrity believes it is the obligation of entertainers to discuss political topics. A number of celebrities, including Mark Wahlberg, Billy Joel, and Kevin Hart have said explicitly in the past that they prefer to stay away from talking about their personal politics.

An witness to the incident, who asked not to be named, told the paper: There was a bit of a commotion and then this man just collapsed in the street. Within seconds an ambulance and about four police vans arrived at the scene. They started giving him first aid around his neck. It must have been within 30 seconds or so a helicopter arrived and two or three police cans started going around the side streets.

"Report: Florida Woman Allegedly Stole More Than $93,000 in City Funds to Pay for Brazilian Butt Lift - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/18/2017,"A woman who worked for the city of Gainesville, Florida, allegedly stole more than $93, 000 in city funds and used the money to pay for a Brazilian butt lift as well as other purchases, according to a report. [An auditors report released Wednesday showed that Natwaina Clark, 33, stole $93, 000 in public funds and used $8, 500 of the stolen funds toward a Brazilian butt lift, the Gainesville Sun reported.  The report also found that Clark, a former city staff specialist, used her credit card issued by the city 136 times for $61, 000 in unauthorized charges, charged her supervisors credit cards 36 times for $31, 000, and charged $500 to a coworkers card that she used five times. Clarks alleged misuse of city funds took place between November 2015 and March 2017. The report also found that heads of city departments allowed the misuse of funds because of a lack of oversight over the charges. An auditor for the city said that Gainesvilles parks department did not provide much oversight over the 15 months the purchases were made, making it easy for someone to steal the funds. Documents show that Clark, whom the city hired in August 2015, transferred $41, 000 to her personal PayPal account to have enough money to pay for the $8, 500 cosmetic procedure. Clark, whose yearly salary was $33, 500, also spent thousands of dollars on her cable bill, television, and food purchases. She allegedly itemized her PayPal transactions using terms such as decor, holiday banners, and storage bins.  Clark reportedly told   that she had a boyfriend that would purchase her things as a way to explain her extravagant lifestyle beyond her means. The department did not notice the charges until they noticed they were over budget. Clark was arrested March 28 and was booked on felony charges of larceny and scheme to defraud, WFLA reported."
Soros-Linked Groups Behind California Ban on Detaining Illegal Immigrants,Breitbart,John Binder,6/18/2017,"A plan to ban local and county jails in California from detaining illegal immigrants with immigration detainers is being pushed by open borders organizations. The groups have ties to globalist billionaire George Soros. [As   blog Mother Jones reported, the initiative to protect illegal immigrants would be included in the California state budget. The proposal makes it illegal for local or county jails from entering into agreements with federal immigration authorities to protect Americans from illegal immigrant crime.  Coincidentally, the two organizations pushing the plan behind the scenes have links to Soros and his infamous Open Society Foundation, which serves as a   to enrich   social justice and open borders groups. For instance, the Immigrant Legal Resource Center (ILRC) which is promoting the plan, has taken grant money from Soros Open Society Foundation since at least 2009 when it received $200, 000 from Soros. In 2012, ILRC took even more money from the Open Society Foundation, receiving more than $1. 8 million from Soros that year. The other open borders organization behind the   immigrant California plan is the Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement (CIVIC) This group also has staff ties to Soros. CIVIC staffer Tina Shull runs the organizations storytelling projects, while also being a recipient of the Soros Justice Fellowship, a   grant department that gives out anywhere between $58, 700 to $110, 250 to specific individuals for social justice advocacy. CIVICs   director Christina Fialho told Mother Jones in an interview that California potential ban on detaining illegal immigrants was a powerful first step in the states overall agenda to oppose President Trumps agenda. This is not the first California initiative this year that   organizations have pushed. Breitbart Texas reported in May that the   Alliance of Californians for Community Empowerment (ACCE) pushed legislation forcing landlords to rent to illegal immigrants, even after they know their immigration status.

Stop the Wall Phone App Created by Puerto Rican Professor,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/18/2017,"A college professor in Puerto Rico created a new mobile app to make a game out of stopping President Donald Trumps border walls. [Professor Carlos Marcial Torres created a new mobile app game based on the classic hit Tetris. The app is titled, Stop the Wall.  He opens the game with a screen depicting President Trump.   The game is reactionary. Reacting to Trumps xenophobic, racist and hate phrases and thoughts. We use technology to combat all that, Torres, 33, Al Dia reported. Torres added many Trump phrases into the game, and at one point he adds, The wall just got 10 feet taller, followed by, I would build a great wall and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me.  The game is distributed both on iTunes and Google Play. Google says the game has been downloaded to Android devices between 100 and 500 times, while Apple does not indicate the number of downloads. Apple does say the app has not received enough ratings to have a displayed average rating. The games description on the download page states: Finally, a game based on a classic block puzzle where you have to stop Donald Trumps Wall of Infamy. Have fun while being socially conscious. Compete against your friends to see who can #StopTheWall longer. Share your high scores with all the people in your social networks. Invite your friends (and even Donald Trump) to try and beat your high score.  Torres continues, saying, The immigration issue is one of the most important and significant of the moment, and Trump is one of the most followed guys in the world.  He said people from countries all over the world have been downloading his app. Those include Taiwan, Australia, the U. S. Mexico, China, Norway and the United Kingdom. The professor claims he also built the app to protest the lack of economic support of local filmmakers by the Puerto Rican government. Torres ends the game with more Trumpisms, and a score screen stating #MakeAmericaMexicoAgain.

How do Navy ships operate?,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/18/2017,"(CNN) Whether its an aircraft carrier or any other warship, a United States Navy vessel never sleeps on the open sea thanks to a complex orchestra of people and systems tracking its course. A deadly collision Saturday between the USS Fitzgerald and a container ship off Japans coast raises questions about how military vessels operate. Here are the basics: How does a Navy ship navigate? Service members rely on a constant flow of information from satellite technology, radar, the Global Positioning System and visual cues to track their course and monitor other vessels. Ships receive normal weather updates and imagery from satellites but no   imagery of ocean traffic is available. How much attention they pay to each signal depends on the situation, said CNN national security analyst John Kirby, a retired rear admiral in the US Navy. Vessels approaching shore or heavy traffic use more feedback to adjust position minute to minute, he said. As a vessel gets farther out into lighter traffic the crew uses less feedback to modulate its position.  Its a multifaceted, multilayered application of a series of sensors in real time that are providing feedback not only about where your ship is but where other ships are, he said. On a destroyer, the information flows into the Electronic Chart Display and Information System, which interfaces with the ships GPS receivers and navigation sensors, such as speed and wind indicators, to give watchstanders a computerized   view of position and movement.  Whos actually operating the ship? Unlike merchant vessels, which may not necessarily be manned at the same level at all times, the bridge is staffed 24 hours. In a normal rotation, a typical bridge watch team consists of six to 10 members responsible for safe navigation and operation under the officer of the deck, who reports to the commanding officer.  The helmsman is a sailor who controls the direction of the ship based on orders from the conning officer. The quartermaster is the direct representative of the ships navigator who monitors the surface search radar system and other charts to provide a continuous navigational watch on the bridge. The boatswains mate of the watch is a petty officer who assists the OOD and ensures all bridge watch stations.  Below the bridge is the combat information center, a watch team of six to 10 officers and enlisted specialists responsible for the weapons system. The CIC includes a radar operator who monitors ships within range and a navigation chart plotter who also monitors the electronic chart display and navigation system. Outside the ship, lookouts are typically stationed at the back and near the front on or close to the bridge. Part of the bridge watch team, their job is to constantly scan the horizon with binoculars as a backup to radar in case it misses a small fishing boat or picks up big waves in a heavy sea.  Many times the radar picture may be convincing you of one thing and what you see doesnt match up, Kirby said. You need an extra layer of context and you can only get that from what you can see. Everyone is in constant contact over different types of radio communications, some classified, some not, he said. To communicate with other vessels they use bridge to bridge radio, the maritime version of a CB radio, in which they pick up a microphone and find the common frequency to talk in real time. What assistance does a ship have from any dispatch or central authority? Higher headquarters maintain a regional picture of activity, tracking a ships progress and location. But once a vessel receives orders, it tends to be   under the aegis of the commanding officer. He has singular authority over the vessel, making him a constant presence in the bridge, especially in busy environments involving high levels of feedback, Kirby said. Every commanding officer has full authority to defend his or her ship with weapons if he or she deems another vessel poses a hostile, direct threat to the safety and security of his ship and crew, he said. The commanding officer of the USS Fitzgerald was in his cabin when the collision happened, suggesting the immediate environment did not warrant his presence in the bridge, Kirby said. The captain would be on bridge if coming into port or leaving port or in a highly trafficked area, because its more dangerous, he said.  The fact that he was down in his cabin tells you this wasnt that kind of environment. What sort of training is involved? A lot. It starts at the US Naval Academy or Officer Candidate School and continues through an officers career, taking different paths depending on the person: classroom time, tests, simulations,    training on different warships. Navy ship bridge teams in particular complete a management course that includes   and communications training, from situational awareness, analysis of error chains, voyage planning, stress and fatigue, among other skill sets. By the time an individual is standing watch on the bridge of a warship they have gone through an extensive amount of training and education and    experience to get to that point, Kirby said.  Why dont destroyers hit cargo ships (or vice versa) more often?  Because of all the precautions noted above, collisions involving Naval ships are uncommon, Kirby said. There is nothing the Navy takes more seriously than the safety and security of its ships and its sailors. Period. And, thats why collisions at sea are so rare, he said. Do they happen? Yes. But it is exceedingly rare because the Navy takes safety and security so incredibly seriously because the stakes are so incredibly high. The commanding officer has several options if a cargo ship deliberately targets a destroyer    a rare scenario that Kirby suspects is not the case with the USS Fitzgerald. A vessel can change course or speed or fire a warning shot if the captain perceives a threat. It has happened as recently as January the USS Mahan fired warning shots at Iranian boats as the vessels came within 900 yards. What could have prevented the USS Fitzgerald tragedy? Its too soon to tell, Kirby said. Because the radio room was hit hard, the degree to which radio communications were used before and after the collision will likely come under scrutiny, he said. Otherwise, he said one thing is certain. The Navy will investigate completely and thoroughly and they will use what they learn in schools so it will never happen again."
Missing USS Fitzgerald sailors found dead,CNN,Brad Lendon,6/18/2017,"(CNN) Seven missing sailors from the USS Fitzgerald were found dead in flooded berthing compartments following the warships collision with a merchant vessel, a US military official said. The Navys 7th Fleet said searchers found the bodies Sunday morning, Japan time, after the   destroyer returned to its base in Japan. This loss is something we all feel, Vice Adm. Joseph Aucoin, commander of the US 7th Fleet, told reporters alongside the ship at Yokosuka Naval Base in Japan Sunday. We have found a number of the remains . .. of our missing shipmates, and our deepest sympathies go out to the families of those shipmates, he said. The Navy on Sunday released sailors names. The deceased sailors are:    Gunners Mate Seaman Dakota Kyle Rigsby, 19, from Palmyra, Virginia,    Yeoman 3rd Class Shingo Alexander Douglass, 25, from San Diego,    Sonar Technician 3rd Class Ngoc T Truong Huynh, 25, from Oakville, Connecticut,    Gunners Mate 2nd Class Noe Hernandez, 26, from Weslaco, Texas,    Fire Controlman 2nd Class Carlos Victor Ganzon Sibayan, 23, from Chula Vista, California,    Personnel Specialist 1st Class Xavier Alec Martin, 24, from Halethorpe, Maryland,    Fire Controlman 1st Class Gary Leo Rehm Jr. 37, from Elyria, Ohio,   The admirals comments Sunday indicated the loss of life could have been much worse. There was a big puncture, a big gash underneath the waterline along the bottom of the ship, Aucoin said. The water flow into compartments that were berthing areas for 116 of the ships crew was tremendous he said, adding that there wasnt a lot of time in those spaces that were open to the sea. Aucoin said the cabin of the Fitzgeralds captain, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was completely destroyed. Hes lucky to be alive, he added. Benson was flown off the crippled ship by helicopter after the accident and was being treated at the naval hospital at Yokosuka, according to Aucoin, as were two other sailors who were medevaced. Crew saved ship from sinking, The admiral said the ship had been in danger of sinking but was saved by the heroic efforts of the crew. The crew had to fight very hard to keep the ship afloat, he said.  The     destroyer and the ACX Crystal, a   container ship flagged in the Philippines, collided early Saturday local time off Japans Izu Peninsula, officials said. The area sees heavy maritime traffic, with 400 to 500 vessels crossing it daily. The destroyer suffered severe damage to its starboard side, while the container ship sustained light damage. While photos showed serious damage above the waterline, the container ship also did severe damage below it. A 7th Fleet statement said the collision did significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room. Container ships like the Crystal have bulbous bows under the waterline and that portion of the cargo vessel plowed into the US warship. The Fitzgerald had left the base Friday for routine operations. Multiple investigations expected, Aucoin would not speculate on how the accident occurred, but said there would be multiple investigations into the collision, including one by the Navys Judge Advocate General and one by the US Coast Guard. Other investigations could come from the Japanese and Philippine authorities because of where the accident took place and the Philippine registry of the container ship. The Fitzgerald is an Arleigh     destroyer commissioned in 1995. The vessel is 505 feet long. It normally carries a crew of about 330 sailors and is homeported in Yokosuka. Despite the significant damage to the destroyer, Aucoin said he expected it would rejoin the fleet. The ship is salvageable, he said. It will take months, hopefully under a year for repairs. You will see the USS Fitzgerald back as one of our warships, Aucoin said. No one hurt on merchant ship, The ACX Crystal container ship is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by   Corporation, NYK said. No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. It was back in port Sunday. NYK and the ships owner are cooperating with a Japan coast guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said. Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected, NYK said. Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. The ship, which handles general cargo, is manned by a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long."
Trump supporters jaw-dropping hypocrisy,CNN,Dean Obeidallah,6/18/2017,"(CNN) Many Donald Trump supporters are expressing outrage with The Public Theaters production of Julius Caesar because it features a President   Caesar.    In fact, one Trump supporter rushed the stage in Central Park on Friday night in an effort to stop the show    claiming those behind the production have blood on their hands because it contributes to the overall desensitization of violence. The play depicts the Trump lookalike being stabbed to death.  The protester documented her actions on Periscope.  After she was arrested, prominent Trump supporters tweeted their defense of this attempt to silence the play. Ironic to see this response, given that many on the right are so often outraged when college students interrupt or try to silence political views they dont agree with. In any event, the person who stormed the stage was far from the only one on Team Trump going after this production of Caesar. Trumps    Newt Gingrich and Sean Hannity also railed against the production, claiming it incites political violence.  But targeting this production of Caesar is the soul of hypocrisy. Where was this outrage in 2012 when a Minneapolis production of Julius Caesar starred a Barack   as Caesar?  The conservative publication The American Conservative reviewed the play at the time, explaining in no uncertain terms that this Caesar was clearly intended to be Obama while praising the production as riveting.    And where was the outrage in 2015 when the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence staged the   production of Julius Caesar that featured a   female Caesar wearing a pantsuit who was stabbed to death? Media outlets at the time, from NPR to reviewers, noted that this production was clearly intended to evoke Hillary Clinton.  We could possibly forgive this lack of consistency if the Trump supporters had at least called out their candidate when he explicitly called for and defended political violence on the campaign trail on various occasions. Some of the most alarming examples include Trumps words after one of his fans beat up a protester, I thought it was very, very appropriate. Trump shockingly added, And thats what we need a little bit more of.  At another event Trump reminisced about the old days where protesters would be carried out on a stretcher.  Candidate Trump even offered to provide legal fees if his supporters would attack people in his name, If you see somebody getting ready to throw a tomato, knock the crap out of them, would you? Trump added, I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise.  Lets be blunt: Trumps words inciting his crowd to beat up protesters and then publicly defending their actions was, and remains, far more dangerous than any reinterpretation of a Shakespearean play. And to be clear, Shakespeares intention with this classic play is not to make light of killing leaders but is actually a cautionary tale about the costs of political violence. This is truly the opposite of Trumps own words on the campaign trial where he expressly called for political violence. Yet  can you recall Trump supporters protesting his incitement of political violence and streaming their protest on social media? I cant. But I can recall them cheering and actually attacking people in response to his words.  In fact, theres a federal lawsuit currently pending against Trump and his campaign by protesters injured by Trump supporters at a Kentucky campaign rally after Trump yelled, Get em out of here.  Just two months ago a federal judge ruled the lawsuit could proceed, noting that Trumps words    Get em out of here    at least implicitly encouraged the use of violence or lawless action.  And if Trump supporters were sincerely upset by those who employ violent imagery in a political context, they shouldve been screaming in April when Ted Nugent visited the White House. After all, in 2016, Nugent declared that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton should be tried for treason  hung.    Nugent also called Obama a piece of s*** and declared that the   should suck on my machine gun.  But not a word from these Trump supporters about Nugents despicable violent imagery. At least Nugent belatedly seems to get it he announced after the horrific shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise earlier this week that he would no longer use such harsh terms, saying, we have got to be civil to each other.  If Trump supporters are really worried about political violence, they should begin by urging the President to admit that his actions and words on the campaign trail were destructive and wrong.  Anything less sends a message that those who support him are more concerned with shutting down a play because they oppose its content than with reducing political violence in America."
Macron on course for majority in French parliament,CNN,Laura Smith-Spark,6/18/2017,"(CNN) French President Emmanuel Macrons centrist party scored a decisive victory after Sundays second round of parliamentary elections, Frances Interior Ministry announced. With 97% of the vote in, Macrons La Republique En Marche party had won 300 seats. Its political ally, the Mouvement Dmocrate, MoDem, won 41 seats. That margin of victory would give Macron, a   centrist, the large majority he craves to further his political revolution    and would inflict a further blow on the countrys traditional ruling parties. The conservative Les Rpublicains and their allies trailed with about 129 seats. The   Socialist Party and their allies were projected to win 41 to 49 seats. Party leaders began reacting to the projected results soon after polls closed closed Sunday evening.  The   National Front won 8 seats. This evening despite an alarmingly low turnout, the triumph of Emmanuel Macron is indisputable, the defeat of the left is unavoidable, the defeat of the Socialist party is without appeal, the right is facing a real failure, said   Cambadlis, the leader of the Socialist party.  Franois Baroin, the leader of Les Republicains, also remarked on the low turnout.  But he told BFMTV that Macron was the artisan of this victory and wished him success. Macrons party, founded just a year ago, won the first round of elections on June 11 with less than half of eligible voters going to the polls.  Turnout again looked set to be low for the second round. Nationwide, it stood at just over 35% as of 5 p. m. local time (11 a. m. ET) on Sunday, Frances Interior Ministry said on its website, significantly down compared with the same time in the 2012 election.  Macron won the French presidency last month without the support of a traditional mainstream party, as his newly minted En Marche! movement helped carry him to a convincing election victory over   candidate Marine Le Pen. How the elections work, To win a seat outright in the first round of voting, candidates had to win more than half the votes, which must account for at least a quarter of the registered voters. If no single candidate managed to achieve that target, then all candidates who won at least 12. 5% of registered voters advanced to the second round. The winner from the second round will then advance to Parliament. According to BFMTV, more than 1, 000 candidates ran in Sundays elections. La Republique En Marche and the Mouvement Dmocrate won a combined 32. 3% of the vote in the elections first round. The established Les Rpublicains trailed with 15. 8% of the vote.  Both the Republican and Socialist parties, which have traditionally governed during the time of the Fifth Republic, struggled with turnout.  Le Pens right wing National Front party garnered 13. 2% of the vote in last Sundays first round and was originally expected to take one to four seats.   Mlenchons   party claimed 17 seats after accounting for 11% of the vote in the first round. Read: Emmanuel Macron: From political novice to President, Mistrust in politics, Though Macron and his party received a majority, leaders from across the spectrum were quick to point out that the low turnout meant the victory might not amount to a   mandate from the French electorate.  The low level of participation shows that there is a high level of mistrust in politics, Macrons   opponent in the final round of the presidential election, Le Pen, said. The extremely low turnout considerably weakens the legitimacy of the new national assembly and this quinquennium begins on a very bad basis. Mlenchon, leader of the   insoumise movement, had a similar view. We have good news. First of all, the extremely low turnout today has an offensive political significance. Our people have entered a form of general civic strike in this election. Edouard Philippe, the   politician whom Macron selected as his prime minister, called the vote a frank majority and said, through the vote, the French people chose hope over anger. Yet he added that low turnout is never good news, noting that the government had an obligation to succeed. Tonight, the time for action is starting for the new presidential majority, Philippe said. The newly elected President is leading a country suffering from high unemployment, a stagnant economy and security worries. Macron is hoping to carry out the   reforms he promised during his campaign."
What anonymous sources cost journalism,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/18/2017,"(CNN) Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein put out a very odd statement late Thursday night. He attacked anonymous sources and insisted that any story using them is rightly viewed extremely skeptically. I reached out to Jay Rosen, a professor of journalism at New York University and the author of Press Think, a blog about media and politics, for some perspective on the history of anonymous sourcing and what it means for the future of journalism. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Rod Rosenstein urged caution for people reading stories about the Trump White House that contain anonymous sourcing. Is that caution warranted? Why or why not? Rosen: Caution is always advisable toward stories based on anonymous sources. Yes. Even the people who produce these stories would probably agree with that. But if Rod Rosenstein wanted to warn us away from a report he knew to be misleading, his statement fails. It suffers from the same vagueness of origin that casts doubt on the statements of confidential sources.  Which revelations is Rosenstein talking about? What is the predicate for his actions in releasing this statement? What is that phrase, when they do not identify the country. .. doing in there? He seems to want to say more, but something prevents him. Or maybe he wanted to say less, but someone forced him. Either way, his statement is opaque. Which is the whole problem with confidential sources. They are opaque. Cillizza: Lets take a step back. What is the history of anonymous sources? Where did this all start? Rosen: I dont think we know for sure. One of the oldest dynamics in politics     reaching back to the 18th century Parliaments     is when the loser in an internal conflict decides to change the game by going public with a dispute that had previously been kept in house. Since they still have to live in that house, these people tend to be anonymous. This method in political combat first became possible when there were printed journals reporting on Parliament, and coffee houses where public questions were being debated    assisted, of course, by the newspapers of the day, on sale in those establishments.  Roughly speaking, then, the origins of anonymous sourcing, the birth of public opinion as a live factor in politics, and the invention of political reporting all occur together, in the mid 1700s. And that dynamic I identified     loser in an internal dispute goes public, hoping that the reaction will change the outcome      continues unchanged to this day. Cillizza: Is anonymous sourcing on the rise?  Rosen: I would be cautious about any statement like that. That would take a massive content study to determine with any reliability. Such studies are done, but they tend to lag   years behind the fact.  One thing we can point to is the rise of publications     Politico, Business Insider, Axios would be three     that in my view simply dont care how often they have to rely on blind sources. They have made the call that getting the inside dope is more important to their readers than any fussy concerns about transparency. They have decided not to worry about it. In fact, Henry Blodget, founder of Business Insider, has said, We will grant anonymity to any source at any time for any reason. Pretty clear statement. The existence of such competitors obviously has an effect on the climate as a whole.  Cillizza: President Obamas White House was notoriously hard on leakers. Trump seems to have taken that to a new level. Accurate reading? Rosen: Its well established that Obama was more aggressive against leakers than any previous president. Judging by his public statements, Trump is even more willing to go to war, but I dont think we know what is going on behind the scenes. The first criminal case against a leaker began this month. Its plausible to suspect that a lot is happening on this front, but we simply dont know enough to say for sure.  Cillizza: Finish this sentence: Anonymous sources are _________ in modern journalism.  Rosen: Anonymous sources are withdrawals against the bank balance built up by more transparent practices in modern journalism. News accounts that rely on confidential sources do not contain within themselves the information required for us to trust them. By definition we cannot go to the source because the source is hidden. If we extend our trust to such reports, we do so because of reputation: the reporters reputation, or more often the news brands. Some acts of journalism are easier to trust than others. If I tell you what the data shows about test scores in different schools around your district, and I also link to the data so you can check for yourself, that is a fundamentally different act from. .. The special counsel overseeing the investigation into Russias role in the 2016 election is interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of a widening probe that now includes an examination of whether President Trump attempted to obstruct justice, officials said. (My italics.)  That term, officials said is relatively hard to trust. We cant go to those people and ask: did you really say that? We cant decide how credible they are, and act accordingly. Instead we have to trust the Washington Post, which gave us this report, and its reporters. It might be rational to do so, but its also subtractive. We are drawing on reserves of trust built up by previous acts of journalism that told us the Post could be trusted. Some acts of reporting add to the bank account, others draw upon reserves of trust. To put it another way, when trust is the currency, stories that depend on anonymous sources are expensive."

Syrian warplane shot down by US jet,CNN,Barbara Starr,6/18/2017,"(CNN) A US Navy fighter jet shot down a Syrian warplane after the Syrian jet dropped bombs near Syrian Democratic Force (SDF) fighters on Sunday, the US military said in a statement.  The shootdown came a little more than two hours after forces allied with the Syrian regime of Bashar   attacked the   Syria town of JaDin, which was controlled by the SDF. A number of SDF forces, who are backed by the   coalition, were wounded in the attack, the statement from the Combined Joint Task Force said. The attack drove the SDF from JaDin, which is west of Raqqa, the coalition statement said. Related: Explaining the complex crisis in Syria, Later, a Syrian government   attacked the SDF forces with bombs. In accordance with rules of engagement and in collective   of   forces, (the Syrian jet) was immediately shot down by a US    Super Hornet, the coalition statement said. The shootdown was the first of a Syrian aircraft by the US military since it began fighting ISIS in the country in 2014. The Syrian Armed Forces, meanwhile, said one of its warplanes was attacked in the Raqqa countryside, while it was carrying out a combatant mission against ISIS terrorist organization. The pilot is missing, the Syrian statement said. The Syrian military called the action a flagrant aggression that affirmed the United States real stance in support of terrorism, according to Syrian Armed Forces. Related: Everything you need to know about ISIS, The attack stresses coordination between the US and ISIS, and it reveals the evil intentions of the US in administrating terrorism and investing it to pass the   project in the region, it said. The statement from the   coalition said it is operating in Syria to fight ISIS, which has taken over areas of Syria during the countrys civil war, and not the Syrian regime or its partners. But the coalition said it would defend itself and its allies. The demonstrated hostile intent and actions of   forces toward coalition and partner forces in Syria conducting legitimate   operations will not be tolerated, the coalition statement said."
"Portugal wildfire: 62 killed, victims burned in cars as they fled",CNN,Julia Jones,6/18/2017,"(CNN) A raging wildfire ripping through central Portugal has killed at least 62 people and injured dozens more in what officials there described as the greatest wildfire tragedy of recent years.  Eight firefighters are among the injured and four of them are in critical condition, Portuguese Interior Minister Constanca Urbano de Sousa said. She asked the Portuguese to stop sending supplies as teams on the ground already had more than they could manage and the influx of water, food and medical equipment was creating logistical difficulties.  The government has declared three days of mourning.  The head of Portugals judiciary police told reporters the fire was started by lightning. We have been able to determine that the origin of the fire was caused by dry thunderstorms, Jos Maria Almeida Rodrigues said, according to the Portuguese   news agency Lusa.  The blaze spread Saturday to the Pedrgo Grande community, forcing residents to flee the area to escape towering flames. Pedrgo Grande is about 120 miles north of Lisbon. The municipalitys Mayor, Valdemar Alves, said there were areas completely surrounded by the blaze. I am shocked with this death toll,Alves told TVI.  Many cars could not get out and people burned to death inside their cars, Interior Ministry official Jorge Gomes told CNN affiliate TVI. Hundreds of firefighters were still fighting the flames Monday. Portuguese Prime Minister Antnio Costa said schools in the municipalities of Pedrogo, Figueir and Castanheira will be closed for an indefinite period and exams will be postponed. Portugals President, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, offered a word of comfort to those still battling the fires and said that all that could be done was done. Reaction pouring in, European countries are coming together to assist Portugal. France and Spain have sent planes to help battle the blaze, the European Commission said. We express our condolences to those that have lost loved ones, said Christos Stylianides of the European Commission. The EU is fully ready to help. All will be done to assist the authorities and people of Portugal at this time of need. Overwhelmed by the tragedy of Pedrgo Grande. The Portuguese people have our solidarity, support and affection, Spains President Mariano Rajoy Brey wrote on Twitter. Pope Francis prayed for the victims during his weekly prayer on Sunday. I express my closeness with the dear Portuguese people for the devastating fire that is affecting the forests around Pedrgo Grande, causing many deaths and injuries. We pray in silence, the Pope said. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi also expressed his condolences on Twitter. The Portuguese Football Federation changed its Twitter avatar to black to mourn the victims of the fire and the Portugal team observed a moment of silence before its first match in the Confederations Cup against Mexico on Sunday. The federation said it will make a donation to help the victims and their families. Others expressed their grief on social media. I cant express what is going through my soul, Srgio Fonseca posted on Facebook.  I cant go to Figueir dos Vinhos and my parents and brothers have had a night of horror, Fonseca said. The roof of our home was ripped apart by the strong wind . .. Im on the other side, but my head and my heart are always with them.  He later told CNN he was able to reunite with his parents and brothers, who were tired but safe and thankful to be alive. Travel warning, Britain issued a travel warning for its citizens warning them of the fires in Portugal and urging them to be careful while visiting or driving through woodland areas. Around 2. 6 million British nationals visited Portugal in 2015. Most visits are  the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office said in a statement. On Friday, Portugals National Authority for Public Safety issued wildfire alerts due to high temperatures, low humidity and strong winds. Last year, thousands of firefighters battled at least 12 huge fires across the country.  Three people were killed and over 1, 000 evacuated in the Portuguese island of Madeira due to the fierce wildfires a year ago."
Amazon and Whole Foods: An Organic Affluenza Experience - Breitbart,Breitbart,Samuel Chi,6/17/2017,"Would you like a side of kale with that cellphone battery? [That sounds like an inquiry coming from your Alexa in the    future as Amazon. com is set to purchase organic supermarket Whole Foods for $13. 7 billion. The acquisition will firmly move the online retail behemoth into the realms of both the    business as well as grocery.  Amazon will gain over 460 stores nationwide     including more than 80 in the state of California. And its presence will put major pressure on other groceries as Amazon is expected to use its considerable online retail muscle to create a giant network of food delivery service. The    market as we know it is a dinosaur, Phil Lempert, the food trends editor for NBCs Today, told the San Francisco Chronicle. This is going to be a great shot in the arm for the industry.  Amazon currently has a small grocery delivery arm named AmazonFresh. Its a   grocery delivery service offered to only the companys Prime members for a monthly fee of $14. 99 and available in about just 20 U. S. cities. With the acquisition of Whole Foods, this adds 440 refrigerated warehouses within 10 miles of probably 80 percent of the population, Michael Pachter, an analyst for Wedbush Securities, told the Los Angeles Times. More importantly, it puts refrigerated distribution within 10 miles of probably 95 percent of Prime members. That means we can rely upon Whole Foods consistently high quality meat and produce, and can rely upon prompt delivery from the store as a distribution point.  But make no mistake, the Whole Foods clientele, like Amazons Prime membership, is very much affluent and mostly urban and suburban. Ordinary Americans dont necessarily crave quinoa salad with a side of   dressing for lunch. Its the reason Whole Foods was for sale in the first place, as the supermarket chain, derisively dubbed Whole Paycheck by some, has struggled to compete     even with other organic outlets such as Trader Joes. The bigger picture is that for Jeff Bezos, founder and chief executive of Amazon, its just another piece of his  . Amazon is adding its own logistics network, which was responsible for 43 percent of all online sales in the U. S. last year (while accounting for just 0. 2 percent of the grocery and food market share). We will take all the capacity that the U. S. Postal Service can give us and that UPS can give us and we still need to supplement it, Bezos said at Recodes 2016 Code Conference in Rancho Palos Verdes, according to Bloomberg. So were not cutting back. Were growing our business with UPS. Were growing our business with the U. S. Postal Service.  And with Whole Foods    stores, Amazon will soon have a   apparatus for its delivery service in some of the nations most affluent markets. Pretty soon, you can indeed pick up some kale with that cellphone battery if you dont want to have either dropped off at your front porch. Follow Samuel Chi on Twitter @ThePlayoffGuru."
Watchdog to probe Trump admin on civil rights,CNN,Miranda Green,6/17/2017,"Washington (CNN) The US Commission on Civil Rights announced Friday that it will investigate the Trump administrations enforcement of civil rights, saying it has concerns about the impact of proposed budget and staff cuts across the federal government. The independent government agency, which is tasked with monitoring federal civil rights enforcement, unanimously approved a   probe into whether the cuts will allow federal civil rights offices to perform their duties under the law. Along with changing programmatic priorities, these proposed cuts would result in a dangerous reduction of civil rights enforcement across the country, leaving communities of color, LGBT people, older people, people with disabilities, and other marginalized groups exposed to greater risk of discrimination, the commission wrote in a statement announcing the investigation. The commission cited proposed staff decreases in several departments and agencies as well as the actions of the Justice Department and the Education secretary in its reasons for taking the assessment. The administrations budget would reduce money for civil   offices in several agencies, making cuts of 15% and 23% in some cases, and would eliminate the EPAs Environmental Justice program and the nonprofit Legal Services Corp. which supports civil legal aid for   Americans, the commission said. The Justice, Education and Labor departments and the Environmental Protection Agency were among seven agencies and departments that the commission listed as of special concern. The commission also criticized the Just Departments decision to place Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers at courthouses, saying it was a dangerous impediment to access to justice for all Americans. The agency also said the revised priorities of the departments civil rights division do not mention the need for constitutional policing or to combat discrimination against the LGBT community or people with disabilities, adding that the budget request calls for cutting 121 positions, including 14 attorneys. The commission also called out Education Secretary Betsy DeVos by name, citing her repeated refusal in congressional testimony to promise that the department would enforce federal civil rights laws. Further, the administrations proposed budget would cut 46 staff positions at the departments civil rights office, which investigates sex, race disability and age based complaints, the statement said. Committee Chair Catherine E. Lhamon said in the statement on the investigation: For 60 years, Congress has charged the commission to monitor federal civil rights enforcement and recommend necessary change. We take this charge seriously, and we look forward to reporting our findings to Congress, the President, and the American people.  The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the commissions announcement."

"Search is on for 7 missing US sailors, cause of ship collision off Japan",CNN,Brad Lendon,6/17/2017,"Tokyo (CNN) The search was on for seven US sailors missing after an American warship and a merchant vessel collided off the coast of Japan, as US forces and Japanese authorities worked to figure out why the vessels struck each other. The     destroyer USS Fitzgerald and the ACX Crystal, a   container ship flagged in the Philippines, collided early Saturday local time, officials said. The destroyer suffered severe damage to its starboard side, while the container ship sustained light damage. This has been a difficult day, Vice Adm. Joseph P. Aucoin, commander of the US 7th Fleet, said. Forces overnight intensified their search for the missing sailors and tried to get a handle on the cause of a crash in a busy maritime zone crossed daily by 400 to 500 ships. US and Japanese crafts scoured the spot where the collision happened, about 56 nautical miles southwest Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula. The missing sailors could be trapped in a damaged section of the destroyer, a statement from the 7th Fleet suggested. It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side . .. to methodically continue the search for the missing, the statement said. President Donald Trump retweeted an update Saturday from the US 7th Fleet on the ships status and the    mission, saying: Thoughts and prayers with the sailors of USS Fitzgerald and their families. Thank you to our Japanese allies for their assistance. A senior administration official told CNN that Trump is closely monitoring the USS Fitzgerald and will continue getting updates on the situation there. A difficult day for the Navy, Naval commanders praised the sailors for containing flooding caused by the collision, stabilizing the ship and sailing it back to port at the US naval base in Yokosuka, where divers inspected its damage and developed a plan for repairs and inspection. The ship had left the base on Friday for routine operations. The collision affected Fitzgeralds forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room, the 7th Fleets statement said. A Navy official said the point of impact was where crucial communications equipment was located, knocking out    and other forms of communication on the ship and forcing the crew to revert to the use of satellite phones. Fitzgeralds commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors. All three were in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan. The Fitzgerald is an Arleigh     destroyer with a crew of approximately 330 sailors. The vessel is 505 feet long. It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is   to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the    region, the service said. No one hurt on merchant ship, The merchant vessel with which the Fitzgerald collided is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said.  It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by   Corporation, NYK said. No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said. It is back in port. NYK and the ships owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said.  Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected, NYK said. The   website marinetraffic. com shows the ship left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p. m. local time, officials said after the wreck. Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. The ship, which handles general cargo, is manned by a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long. Shipping zone can be precarious, The large size of the container ship    its almost three times as heavy as the Fitzgerald    may have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Commands Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor. The last known fatal incident in the zone was in 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japans coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead.  In January, the USS Antietam ran aground while anchoring near Yokosuka."
3 Republican governors sign on to letter rejecting Trumpcare,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,6/17/2017,"Three Republican governors     John Kasich of Ohio, Brian   Sandoval of Nevada, and Charlie Baker of Massachusetts     signed   onto a letter sent to congressional leaders Friday rejecting the   current iteration of the GOP healthcare bill.     In the letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and   Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, three Republican governors   and four Democratic governors called for bipartisan efforts to   reform the healthcare system.     While we certainly agree that reforms need to be made to our   nations health care system, as Governors from both sides of the   political aisle, we feel that true and lasting reforms are best   approached by finding common ground in a bipartisan fashion, the   letter said.     The governors also admonished the House GOP version of the   American Health Care Act for creating more problems in the   healthcare system than it solves.     It calls into question coverage for the vulnerable and fails to   provide the necessary resources to ensure that no one is left   out, while shifting significant costs to the states, said   the letter. Medicaid provisions included in this bill are   particularly problematic. Instead, we recommend Congress address   factors we can all agree need fixing.

"Geert Wilders: Lets Stop the Cowardice, And Tell The Truth About Islam",Breitbart,Geert Wilders,6/17/2017,"This week, a documentary called Wilders premiered at DocFest, a film festival for documentaries in the British town of Sheffield. [The documentary is made by American film director Stephen Robert Morse. Although he does not agree with my political views, he at least tried to bring a balanced story, which is more than I can say of many Dutch journalists.  I allowed Morse and his team to follow me around for a few months. The documentary shows how, due to Islamic death threats, I have to live under   police protection, am being driven around in armoured cars, am obliged to wear a bulletproof vest whenever I have to speak in public, etc. Some live in almost similar situations, such as Danish cartoonist Kurt Westergaard and his Swedish colleague Lars Vilks, British author Salman Rushie, Danish historian Lars Hedegaard, and others. In that sense, this documentary is also a tribute to them. What we all have in common is that we are on Islams death list. But what always strikes me is that I am the only elected politician on the list.  All politicians competing in elections claim to be standing for office with the goal of serving the people. But serving the people begins with telling them the truth. The truth about Islam is not a pleasant one. How wonderful would it be if Islam were what most of our politicians claim it to be: a religion of peace. Wonderful, but nave, for the truth is that almost all terrorist acts committed in the world today are committed in the name of Islam. Many politicians do not tell the truth about Islam. Some find it much easier to parrot the   dogmas of the left. Others are afraid of having to live like me and Westergaard, Vilks, Rushdie, Hedegaard and others. But I do not consider that a valid excuse.   is forced to be a politician, but if you do choose to do so, allowing yourself to be silenced by the threat of violence, means that you allow the violent side to win. And that is something no democratic politician should ever do. Over the past decades, the threat of terrorism in the West has steadily grown. This growth has everything to do with the growth of Islam in our democratic societies. Politicians who refuse to see this reality are not just fooling themselves but also endangering the citizens. That is why today everyone is on the death list of Islam. We are all at risk now. And this is totally unacceptable. People have the right to live safely in their own towns and cities. That, too, is a basic human right. In my opinion, it overrides the rights of the followers of Islam in our society to live according to their   religion. The West should not grant Islam the freedom to abolish the freedoms of the West. There are already plenty Islamic nations in the world, such as Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, where Sharia is the law of the land. Why dont those who want to introduce Sharia in our land just move there? Sooner or later, even those politicians who still prefer to look away from the problems will be forced to face them. Meanwhile, however, we are losing precious time. And the present governing elite is entirely to blame for that. The more Islam it allows into our country, the less free we will become. In my country, the Netherlands, we are currently in the process of forming a government coalition. Although my party, the Party for Freedom (PVV) has become the second largest party in parliament, the Liberal Party (VVD) of the outgoing Prime Minister Mark Rutte, which managed to remain the largest party despite suffering heavy losses in the 15 March 2017 elections, refuses to form a government with the PVV. So does the third party, the   (CDA) of Sybrand Buma. This has resulted in political gridlock, making it virtually impossible to form a majority government. Earlier this week, both Mark Rutte and Sybrand Buma wrote a letter explaining why they refuse to cooperate with the PVV. They do so, they write, because they consider the PVV to be radical.  It is not the PVV, however, which is radical it is Islam. Let us stop the cowardice. Let us reject political correctness. As General Patton said: The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty.  I will keep doing my duty. Probably again as leader of the opposition. And I will keep speaking out, whatever the price may be. I will fight the Islamization of my country and defend its freedom. Without compromise and with determination, conviction and strength. Always. Geert Wilders MP is leader of the Party for Freedom (PVV) in The Netherlands."
Poll: Most Voters Have Not Heard of Democratic 2020 Election Candidates - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/17/2017,"There is a minefield of potential 2020 election candidates in the Democratic Party waiting to challenge President Trump, but most voters have not heard of many of them, according to a new poll. [The   Consult poll asked 1, 990 registered voters their views on 19 potential Democratic challengers to Trumps presidency.  The list of potential candidates identified in the survey includes eight senators, five governors, a mayor of a large city, a congressman, two CEOs, a former vice president, and a failed Senate candidate. Of those mentioned in the survey, half of the respondents did not know most of the candidates. All bets are off when it comes to the composition of the 2020 Democratic primary, said Morning Consult   and Chief Research Officer Kyle Dropp. This early polling indicates that many of the names being floated in Washington still have a lot of work to do in terms of building national profiles.  Most survey respondents were able to identify and have opinions on former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, ( ) and Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ).   of the voters surveyed said they knew enough about Biden and Warren to have formed opinions about the candidates. Sanders was not included in the survey. According to Morning Consult, Biden was the most popular candidate of the list of potential 2020 Democratic candidates, with 74 percent of respondents having a positive view of the former vice president. Warren came in second, with 51 percent of respondents viewing her favorably. The number of those rumored to be potential Democratic candidates for the 2020 election pales in comparison to the list of people who have filed to run for president so   129 people have filed to run for the presidency in 2020."

E3 Hands-On with South Park: The Fractured but Whole: South Park Takes Aim at Superhero Genre - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/17/2017,"The title of South Park: The Fractured but Whole essentially sets the comedic tone for the upcoming   RPG which sets its sights on the superhero genre.[  South Parks latest video game acts as a sequel to the 2014 release South Park: The Stick of Truth which was well received by critics and fans alike due to its surprisingly compelling storyline,   humor, and engaging gameplay. The Fractured but Whole aims to outdo The Stick of Truth in every way, ramping up the series signature offensive humor and outlandish storylines. The new storyline of The Fractured but Whole sees the main characters assuming their superhero identities that many fans will recognize from the TV show. A fight between members of the team known as The Coon and Friends results in the superhero group splitting into two factions in an apparent nod to Marvels Civil War, one led by Cartman as The Coon and another led by Kennys alter ego Mysterion. The player takes on the role of The New Kid and can play as a male or female character. The demo that I played at E3 took place in a strip club. Your character starts as a lowly sidekick, not yet having made the transition to   hero. You accompany Captain Diabetes inside the club where you search for a particular stripper with a male   tattoo on her chest. Players must traverse the strip club speaking to various strippers and attempting to gain information from club patrons. Eventually, two men offer to take you to the VIP room in the back of the club in exchange for a lapdance. This triggers a lapdance minigame where players must move the controllers analog sticks in certain directions in order to grind on the lap of the business man. Once this is over, the businessmen become belligerent which leads to a fight scene. This is where we get to see The Fractured but Wholes combat system in action. Much like The Stick of Truth, the combat is   with players moving their team members on a grid system and selecting certain attacks in order to beat their enemies. Shortly after this fight scene players learn the name of the elusive stripper     Classi, naturally     which leads to Captain Diabetes hatching a new plan to find her. Captain Diabetes suggests concocting a drink that will knock out the club DJ who announces each new stripper, allowing Captain Diabetes to use the PA system to call the stripper to the stage. This leads players on a search mission for certain ingredients which are obtained through various   mechanics such as firecracker and fart throwing. Once all of the suitably disgusting items are found, the DJ is given the drink and promptly leaves to get sick, allowing Captain Diabetes to use the intercom system to call Classi, who attempts to escape upon seeing the player and is then chased by the player and Captain Diabetes, which ends the demo. Overall The Fractured but Whole is made specifically for South Park fans. If youre not a fan of fart jokes and crude humor, this game is not for you. Those that enjoyed The Stick of Truth should be thoroughly impressed with The Fractured but Whole when it releases on October 17.

Armed Citizen Who Captured Georgia Cop Killers: I Loaded Every Weapon I Could,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/17/2017,"The Rutherford County, Tennessee, resident who captured Donnie Rowe and Ricky Dubose, the suspected Georgia cop killers on Thursday, said, I loaded every weapon I could after becoming aware of a   chase and gunfire on nearby Interstate 24. [The resident,    Patrick Hale, had just loaded his family into the car to get out of the path of the killers when they walked upon him.  According to the Tennessean, Hale saw the two men cross a fence about three hundred yards away from his back door.  He said, I prayed like I have never prayed before.  He then backed out of the driveway with a gun on him and his family in the car. While backing up, he realized the men had already closed the distance and were waving frantically, trying to get him stop. He slowed and said the two convicts reached his driveway, then started to surrender.  Hale said: I began to slowly back up as they came closer. At that point, I realized I had two   wanted for murder who just shot at law enforcement and nothing to lose. And for some reason, they started to surrender and lay down on their stomachs on my concrete driveway. If that doesnt make you believe in Jesus Christ, I dont know what will. Hale called 911 and said deputies arrived within three minutes. Holly Morelock, who works in the area in which Hale lives, said, I feel like it was a good thing. When you mess around out here in the county, most of us here have carry permits and carry (weapons). And its our job to protect our families and our homes.  Speaking of Patrick Hale and his family, Morelock said, And Im very proud of the family        because they didnt just turn around and mind their own business. They did what they had to do to protect everybody else around.  AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins. a Breitbart News podcast.

State Supreme Court Rules Mississippi Judge Can Call Herself JudgeCutie - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/17/2017,"The Mississippi State Supreme Court ruled that a county court judge can call herself by the nickname JudgeCutie in one of the fastest decisions the court has made in years. [After justices had heard arguments for two days, the court ruled to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the state Commission on Judicial Performance against Gay   that stated she was using her profession as a judge with her online presence as a means of promoting herself as a musical performer and motivational speaker, the Associated Press reported.  The complaint stated that  s online profile contained her opinions about what she thought of her profession as a Forrest County justice court judge, such as wearing her judges robe in a photo that graced the cover of a book about all her social media posts.  s attorney, Oliver Diaz, argued before the Mississippi State Supreme Court that other judges used names that others might not consider as dignified, such as Judge Noah Soggy Sweat. Sweat served as a circuit court judge from 1966 to 1974. Diaz said the commission unfairly targeted her client because she was a woman. It was a frivolous filing, Diaz said of the complaint. Court documents say JudgeCutie was inspired by the TV judge Judge Judy.  Justices said   did not violate the Mississippi Code of Judicial Conduct, the Daily Mail reported. Justice court judges in the state of Mississippi are elected to their positions and work on a   basis. These judges preside over cases in small claims court of $3, 500 or less, misdemeanor criminal cases, and traffic violations that take place outside city boundaries."

The Celtics and 76ers are reportedly deep into talks for a blockbuster trade that could shake up the NBA Draft,Business Insider,Scott Davis,6/17/2017,"The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are deep into trade   discussions revolving around the Celtics No. 1 pick in this   years draft, according to reports from ESPN and Yahoo.   that the two teams are having   serious trade talks.   saying presumed No. 1 pick   Markelle Fultz could be visiting Philadelphia on Saturday, a sign   of how advanced the talks are.     According to Stein and ESPNs Zach Lowe, the deal is expected to   only involve picks, no players. That could mean a swap of the   Celtics No. 1 pick and and the 76ers No. 3 pick this year, plus   a future first from the Sixers.     With the draft less than a week away, the deal could signal a     for both teams. The 76ers, with a core that includes   Joel Embiid, Dario Saric, and Ben Simmons, could add another       and the top prospect in the draft in   Fultz.       The Celtics, meanwhile, would continue plotting for the future   and collecting assets, biding their time until they find the   right move. While the No. 1 pick would obviously be nice, theres   been debate over how much the Celtics would want a player like   Fultz when they have thrived with Isaiah Thomas handling   playmaking duties. With the No. 3 pick, they could perhaps take a   player like Kansas Josh Jackson, an athletic, defensive wing   that would fit their roster better.     The deal could also affect how other teams draft. For example, if   the 76ers were higher on UCLAs Lonzo Ball than Fultz, perhaps   they would want to jump to No. 1 to take Ball before the Lakers,   who are heavily rumored to be interested in Ball. That could   leave the Lakers to look elsewhere, and could affect other teams   boards.     Such a trade still has plenty of time to happen, but a deal for   No. 1 is somewhat rare in the NBA and could have some     ramifications.   The Boston Celtics and Philadelphia 76ers are. .."
Swedish Police Attacked By 100 Masked Migrant Youths,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/17/2017,"Swedish police in the city of Trollhattan were attacked by up to a hundred masked migrant youths armed with sticks and bats during a riot in the Kronogrden suburb on Thursday. [The masked migrant youths attacked the officers during the second night of rioting in the area. They also attacked the officers vehicles, slashing the tyres of two police cars. Only one man was arrested in connection with the riots, Swedish paper Aftonbladet reports.  The riot is said to have dramatically escalated after several youths attempted to set a tyre on fire in the street and a security guard intervened to put out the fire. The guard was then attacked by the youths who threw stones at him. Peter Asp, the communications officer for the City of Trollhattan, said the riots were power struggle for territory in the district among rival gangs. He claimed that the young men rioting were Somali migrants, while the police have only said the men come originally from an Arabic speaking country. Police believe that the riots were sparked by an incident earlier in the week, when children were taken away from their parents by protective services. An administrative court ruled that the parents of the children had physically and psychologically assaulted them. One resident described the riots saying, they drove a police car and threw stones at it. Im a little scared, and its really hard. I can not sleep at night, that night I slept only three hours.  Attacks on police in   suburbs have become more and more common in Sweden in recent years. A leaked report earlier this week showed that the number of   zones had increased by fifty percent in only two years. While the report lists 23 official vulnerable areas some estimate that there could be as many as 55   zones in Sweden. Earlier this year Swedish police officer Peter Springare said that migrants were committing a disproportionate amount of crime in problem suburbs. He said that almost all of the serious criminal cases that came across his desk involved migrants comments that saw him investigated for racial hatred although the charges were later dropped."
"Democrats Warn Trump Congress Will Begin Impeachment Proceedings If He Fires Mueller, Rosenstein",Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/17/2017,"Several Democrats in Congress warned President Trump on Friday that he will face consequences if he fires special counsel Robert Mueller and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. [All Americans, regardless of party, agree on the fundamental principle that no one is above the law, Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) told MSNBC Friday. And if President Trump were to fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein, and then [get] special counsel Mueller fired, I believe Congress would begin impeachment proceedings.   Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) echoed Lieus sentiments, saying that Congress would come together to make sure they overrule Trumps authority on the matter. Congress will not allow the president to so egregiously overstep his authority, Schiff said in a statement. If President Trump were to try to replicate [former President Richard] Nixons Saturday Night Massacre by firing Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in addition to Mueller, Congress must unite to stop him   without respect to party, and for the sake of the nation, he added. Trump claimed on Twitter that he was being investigated for his decision to fire former FBI Director James Comey, insinuating that the man who told [him] to fire the FBI Director is also the one investigating him, referencing the deputy attorney general. He concluded the tweet by saying that the investigation is a witch hunt against him: I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt,     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 16, 2017,  In his Tuesday testimony before the Senate, Rosenstein said he would only fire Mueller under lawful and appropriate orders to prove Muellers firing is for a good cause.  Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( ) saw Trumps tweet as evidence that the president would fire the deputy attorney general. The message the president is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnt apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. Thats undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the presidents oath of office, Feinstein said in a statement."

Chairman of House Media Fairness Caucus: Fake News Is a Threat to Our Democracy - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/17/2017,"Rep. Lamar Smith ( ) spoke with Breitbart News Washington Political Editor Matt Boyle on Breitbart News Saturday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Saturday about the media bias thats reached unprecedented levels since President Donald Trump was elected and poses a risk to the democracy it is tasked to protect. [I think the media bias today is a threat to our democracy for this reason, said Smith, who is the chairman of the House Media Fairness Caucus. If the American people dont get the facts then they cant make good decisions.  And if the American people cant make good decisions because theyre not getting the facts then I think that is a threat to democracy, Smith said. Smith said the   mainstream media is not only replacing facts with opinion but invective and venomous opinions when it comes to reporting on Trump. During the interview, Smith cited a number of polls that show clear media bias, including a   poll conducted in May that shows the majority of Americans     or 65 percent     believe the media publishes fake news.  Smith also said that the media has an incredible responsibility to provide accurate news and that the constant barrage of personal attacks on the president and Republicans can contribute to individuals acting irrationally as was the case this past week when a shooter opened fire on GOP lawmakers and staff at a baseball practice in Alexandria, VA. The gunman,    James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders presidential campaign and posted   messages on social media, died from his injuries after Capitol Police on security detail for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) engaged him in a gun battle. Scalise remains in critical condition following multiple surgeries for his injuries. Ive never seen before in my 35 years of involvement in politics, and quite frankly this amount of venom contributes to     Im not saying its the only reason     but it does contribute to an environment of hatred and violence and we shouldnt be surprised I think if it does have an impact, Smith said. Smith also said that the media clearly did not expect Trump to win the presidency and that it was a shock to their system.  But thats still no excuse for the amount of bias were seeing, Smith said. When Boyle asked Smith what Americans should do to fight media bias, he said people should speak out. The most important thing that we can do to counter the medias bias, quite frankly, is to speak out against it, Smith said, adding that he is not advocating censorship but encouraging people to write to their representatives in Congress and to write letters to the editors of their local newspaper. The mistake we make overall is letting the media tell us what to think, Smith said. Weve got make sure that we warn the American people to not let the liberal media tell them what to think."

The disclosure  covers   Trumps finances from January 2016 until April 15, 2017.     One listing on the report, Trumps    golf club estate in   Palm Beach, Florida, stands out, due in part for its $37. 2   million in   revenue, about $7. 5 million more than   in 2016.     The estate made $29. 8 million in 2015, and $15. 6 million in 2014.     Trump has spent 25 days at    since he took office,   prompting sharp criticism about the visits and questions about   whether Trump was   financially from them.     Trump has also been accused of using    for official   government business by hosting world leaders there, including   Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who stayed at the resort in   February.     Shortly before Trumps inauguration,    also doubled its   annual membership fee to $200, 000.     In his five months as president, Trump was  to have   made seven weekend trips to    and two to his golf club   in Bedminster, New Jersey     a club that generated $19. 7 in   revenue, according to the financial disclosure.

Coahuila: How a Border State Government Covered up a Massacre,Breitbart,Cartel Chronicles,6/17/2017,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila     Four years have passed since state authorities claimed to begin investigating how gunmen with Los Zetas cartel were able to kidnap, murder, and exterminate hundreds of victims from rural communities in this border state between 2011 and 2013. The case became one big cover up. [In early 2016, Breitbart Texas reported on how Los Zetas used ovens and   drums to incinerate hundreds of victims from the northern part of the state. The massacre began in 2011 in Allende, Coahuila, but continued for two years throughout the region and in this city. It continued without any state authority making an effort to stop it while local news outlets were muffled. Years later, government officials confirmed that approximately 150 victims were incinerated inside the state prison in Piedras Negras.   At the time, the Coahuila Attorney Generals Office was run by Jesus Torres Chaires, an individual who was singled out in U. S. Court testimony as having received money from Los Zetas. The allegations against Torres Chaires were made by Rodrigo Humberto Uribe Tapia during a   federal trial of a top Zeta associate in Texas. The testimony pointed to Los Zetas giving millions to the state attorney general who in turn would give some of that money to the former Governor Humberto Moreira. As Breitbart Texas reported, Moreira is just one of various Mexican governors who were linked in U. S courts to Los Zetas. Court documents published by this outlet reveal that the U. S. government considered the entire structure of the Coahuila government to be a surrogate of Los Zetas cartel.  In an interview with Mexicos Vanguardia, Torres Chaires claimed that the allegations about him taking money from Los Zetas were lies and he was trying to move on from the events of the massacre in Allende, which he described as things that just happened.  At the time of the massacre and in the years after, the top lawmen in the northern region of Coahuila were Santos Vasquez Estrada and Patricia Rivera Barrera, each during their respective term held the position of PGJE Delegate in Pedras Negras and oversaw most of the rural communities where Los Zetas carried out their massacres. Individuals interviewed by Breitbart Texas revealed that neither of the two officials made any effort to investigate, identify, or target any of the real individuals behind the massacres or the masterminds behind the current drug traffickers in the area. Since the massacre, authorities have publicized the charging of various   Zeta bosses however, the real actors behind the various massacres in the state have escaped scrutiny.  While Vasquez left the PGJE and is currently a criminal defense attorney, Rivera Barrera continues to work at the agency. Breitbart Texas was able to confirm that Rivera Barrera lost her top post in the PGJE after she traveled to Mexico City to take an integrity test commonly called examen de confianza     she failed. Local news outlets erroneously reported that Rivera Barrera had been fired from her job in early 2016.  Rather than being fired from her post by current Coahuila Attorney General Homero Ramos Gloria, Rivera Barrera was simply moved to oversee a PGJE archive warehouse where she continues to collect a directors salary.  While Rivera Barrera failed the integrity tests required by her agency, during her term as the delegate she was able to establish close relations with various U. S. law enforcement agencies and often traveled to Eagle Pass, Texas, and other U. S. cities to interact with her counterparts.  Editors Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Len to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.  The writers would face certain death at the hands of the various cartels that operate in those areas including the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas if a pseudonym were not used.

Palestinian Factions Hail Deadly Jerusalem Terrorist Attack: Praise Be To The Pure Martyrs - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,6/17/2017,"Palestinian factions and terrorist groups hailed an attack carried out by three terrorists that killed a female Israeli police officer in Jerusalem on Friday and wounded others nearby. [The attack took place near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalems Old City and saw three Palestinian terrorists armed with knives and guns open fire and start stabbing those nearby, critically wounding Hadas Malka, 23, a policewomen who died of her wounds. Others were wounded in the assault, and all three terrorists were shot dead by Israeli security forces at the scene.  The Islamic State used its Amaq news agency to claim that soldiers of the caliphate attacked a gathering of Jews.  Hamas rejected the IS claim of responsibility while Israeli officials expressed skepticism over the IS statement. The Islamic Palestinian factions praised the combined attack, with an Islamic Jihad spokesman Dahoud Shihab saying in a statement released immediately after the terrorist event that The martyrs blood that was spilled at the gates of the   Mosque is a clear message that the intifada continues and that the Palestinian people will not give up.  Shihab praised the pure martyrs who were killed while fasting, and noted that the attack in Jerusalem is proof that Jerusalem is the land of the jihad. Praise be to the pure martyrs who rose up to defend the purity and sanctity of the blessed land while screaming in the faces of all those who seek normalization.  Hamas also praised the attack in Jerusalem. Hazem Qassem, one of Hamas spokesmen, said in a special statement that the attack was additional proof that our Palestinian nation continues its revolution against the criminal occupation and that the intifada will continue until we achieve full freedom.  According to him, the death of the three terrorists is proof that the occupation is the true face of terror, terror against which the Palestinian nation is exercising its right to defend itself and its holy places.  The Abou Ali Mustafa Brigades, the military arm of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, also praised the attack and called the carnage a natural response to the crimes of the continuing occupation against our people.  The act sends a clear message to the leaders of the occupation that the opposition and the intifada continue and are revitalized and we havent been broken despite all the steps and tools of criminal oppression, the statement added.  The terrorist organization called for the Palestinian people to continue the heroic attacks that spill the blood of the occupation and to continue supporting the resistance.  Israeli occupation refers to Israels presence in the West Bank, home to historic Jewish communities like Hebron and Beit El, as well as Israels control over eastern Jerusalem, which contains the Temple Mount and Western Wall. Instead of condemning the terrorist attack, the Fatah movement, led by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, slammed what it called the killing of three young Palestinians by the forces of the Israel occupation in East Jerusalem.  Fatah was referring to the three terrorists who were eliminated in the middle of carrying out their murderous assault against Israelis. The statement, published by the movement in the official WAFA Palestinian news agency, added that the deaths of the three attackers represents the continuation of Israeli policies of escalation and is proof that the Israeli occupation government is continuing its policies.  Abbass Fatah movement called for the Israeli occupation government to immediately cease the escalation that does not serve the security or stability of the region.  The movement further called on the international community to seriously consider the possibility of security international protection for the innocent Palestinian people."
"Brooks: Trump Lashing Out in Extremely Disturbing Ways, Not Projecting Mental Stability - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/17/2017,"On Fridays PBS NewsHour, New York Times columnist David Brooks argued that there is no serious evidence of collusion between the Trump camp and Russia, but the president is reacting in a disturbing manner.  Brooks stated, [I]t may be a witchhunt, but hes acting like a witch. You know, to me, weve had this     the idea that theres been collusion between the Russians and the Trump campaign has been investigated for a long time. And so far, weve had no really serious evidence that they did collude, and everything else seems to be leaking out. So, I begin to be a little suspicious   and maybe Im wrong   well see over the long term whether there was any actual act of collusion. There were certainly conversations maybe about some building and some investment, but so far, no evidence of an underlying crime.  He continued, But this, to me, is not a criminal story. Its a psychological story. And its a story about a president who seems to feel under more pressure, under more threat, lashing out in ways that are painfully   but also extremely disturbing to anybody around him. And so, whether its the North Korean Cabinet hearing that he held recently, where they all had to praise him, or the tweets as late as this morning, this is not a president whos projecting mental stability. And the idea that hell fire somebody, whether its Mueller or anybody else, seems very plausible. And so, to me, if theres something really damaging here, its something that has not yet happened caused by the psychological pressure that he apparently feels.

Mistrial declared in Bill Cosbys trial,CNN, Ray Sanchez,6/17/2017,"Norristown, Pennsylvania (CNN) The   case accusing Bill Cosby of aggravated indecent assault ended in a mistrial Saturday after a Pennsylvania jury was unable to come to a unanimous decision.  The outcome leaves one of Americas most recognized entertainers as well as his accusers without vindication, but prosecutors immediately announced they will retry the case.  About an hour into the sixth day of deliberations, Judge Steven ONeill declared that the jury of seven men and five women were hopelessly deadlocked in a legal battle closely watched by the public as well as dozens of women who have accused Cosby of similar misconduct in the past. Do not feel like youve let the justice system down, ONeill told the jurors, who labored for more than 53 hours and asked 12 questions of the court during deliberations.  Addressing Cosby, who appeared stoic and calm at the inconclusive finale of his trial, ONeill said: Its not a failure or a victory.    Outside court, Cosby, 79, was silent, but spokesman Andrew Wyatt pumped his fist in air and declared that Cosbys power is back. A spokeswoman for Cosbys wife, Camille, delivered a statement blasting the prosecution, judge and media: How do I describe the district attorney? Heinously and exploitively ambitious. How do I describe the judge? Overtly and arrogantly collaborating with the district attorney. How do I describe the counsels for the accusers? Totally unethical. How do I describe many, but not all, general media? Blatantly vicious entities that continually disseminated intentional omissions of truths for the primary purpose of greedily selling sensationalism at the expense of a human life. Bill Cosby: A big legacy, forever tarnished,  Angela Agrusa, a member of Cosbys legal team, also took aim at the prosecution.  Juries are stuck when a prosecutor seeks to put someone in prison for things that are simply not presented in the courtroom, she said. And the jury stuck to what they were asked to do, and that is to review the evidence before them and there simply wasnt enough. Cosby lawyer Brian McMonagle thanked the jurors and said, We came here looking for an acquittal but like that Rolling Stones song says, You cant always get what you want. But sometimes you get what you need.  Its too early to celebrate  At a news conference afterward, Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said prosecutors will evaluate and review our case and retry Cosby. Our plan is to move this case forward as soon as possible, he said. He expressed disappointment over the mistrial, praised the extraordinary sacrifices of the jury and said one of the good outcomes of the trial was that two Cosby accusers got to face the defendant in court. Steele said Andrea Constand, the woman who accused Cosby of drugging and assaulting her, would not be speaking to the media. He praised her courage.    Hollywood reacts to Bill Cosby mistrial, We are just in awe of what she has done, Steele said. The decision to retry Cosby lies in the fact that shes entitled to a verdict in this case.  The judge said he would try to schedule a new trial within 120 days. Dolores Troiani, Constands attorney, said her client consoled other accusers who broke down when the mistrial was announced.  You know, she is a rock, Troiani said of Constand. Everyone else was so upset and shes there saying, You know this was meant for a reason. . .. We did what we came here to do    which was share what had happened to her and hopefully encourage other women to come forward. I think she accomplished that. Attorney Gloria Allred, who represents many of Cosbys accusers, said she hopes the court will allow other prior bad act witnesses to testify at the next trial. We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity, but justice will come, she said.  If the court allows more accusers to testify . .. it might make a difference. In other words, its too early to celebrate Mr. Cosby. Round two may be just around the corner. Gloria Allred: Round 2 is coming Linda Kirkpatrick, one of the accusers who stood with Allred outside the courthouse, said of Cosby, He thought he could bury us. He didnt know we were seeds. We are sprouting up. We are looking for reform, uncovering the rape culture in this country where victims are blamed and shamed.  In a statement, Cosby accuser Beth Ferrier said, The day has finally come that now the world can see firsthand why so many survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence and rape wait to report. Carl Tobias, a law professor at the University of Richmond, said the jurys deadlock was not a surprise.  When a jury deliberates that long and hard, it often does not convict, Tobias said. The fact that the case turned substantially on one persons testimony may have made it difficult to win and the defense counsel made many efforts to undercut her testimony. The retrial happens next, and the prosecution may try to call other accusers. Cosby faces lawsuits, eyes return to comedy, More questions, The 12 questions jurors asked of the court during deliberations essentially involved hearing the evidence for a second time. The jurys continued questions signaled the possibility of a deadlock on any of the three counts of aggravated indecent assault against Cosby. One of the questions from Friday was: What is reasonable doubt? Prosecutors say Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted Constand, the former director of operations for Temple Universitys womens basketball team, at his home near Philadelphia in January 2004. Cosby pleaded not guilty to the charges. Thursday, jurors told the court they could not come to a unanimous decision beyond a reasonable doubt, which is required in criminal cases. ONeill asked the jury to go back into deliberations for another attempt to reach a verdict, an instruction known in Pennsylvania as the Spencer Charge. Its a set of instructions that asks jurors to   their own views and opinions. Defense attorneys repeatedly asked ONeill to declare a mistrial based on the length of deliberations, but the judge denied their requests. A mistrial means Cosby was not found either guilty or not guilty. Still, the conclusion represents a major win for his defense team, which argued the case never should have reached court. Bailey: Everything about Cosby case is awful, The jury was made up of four white women, six white men, one black woman and one black man. They were bused to Norristown from Allegheny County near Pittsburgh and were sequestered in a hotel for the trial. He said, she said, Cosby was accused of assaulting Constand without her consent, assaulting her when she was unconscious and assaulting her using drugs to impair her ability to consent. If convicted, he faced up to 10 years in prison for each of the three charges. Prosecutors called 12 witnesses, including Constand, over a week of testimony but presented almost no forensic evidence. Cosby declined to testify in his own defense, and his attorneys called only one witness. Cosbys attorneys argued the sexual contact was consensual and worked to highlight inconsistencies in Constands testimony on  . Legal experts said the trial fit the he said, she said arguments common in sexual offense cases. Though dozens of women have accused Cosby of sexual misconduct, only Constands accusations led to criminal charges. One other accuser, Kelly Johnson, testified during the trial as prosecutors sought to establish that Cosby had a pattern of assault. Johnson testified she was drugged and assaulted by Cosby in 1996. Theyre your friends Constand testified over two days last week for the prosecution. In clear and firm statements, she said Cosby, a powerful Temple alumnus, mentored her and took an interest in her career like a father figure. The comedian, 37 years her elder, twice made what she called suggestive passes at her, but she rebuffed him, she said. But when speaking about her career plans one night at his home, the   actor known as Americas Dad gave her three blue pills that he said were herbal and would help her relax, she testified. Put them down, theyre your friends. Theyll take the edge off, Cosby told her, she testified. I said, I trust you. I took the pills and I swallowed the pills down. The Bill Cosby mistrial: How we got here, She began slurring her words and felt dizzy, and told Cosby so, she said. Shortly after, she became incapacitated and felt frozen, she testified. Cosby then placed her on the couch and sexually assaulted her without her consent, she said.  She woke up on the couch early in the morning with her clothes disheveled, she said. I felt really humiliated and I was really confused, she said through tears. I just wanted to go home. Cosby lowered and shook his head in the courtroom as she spoke.  Gianna Constand, the accusers mother, testified that Cosby apologized over the phone to her and her daughter and offered to pay for her schooling. Cosby also declined to tell her what pills he had given Andrea, but he did say they were from a prescription bottle, she testified. I was mistaken Defense attorneys argued the sexual contact was part of a consenting relationship between the two. They cast Cosby as an unfaithful husband    not a criminal. In a tense   the defense pointed out that several of Constands initial statements to police, including the date of the alleged assault, were false. I was really nervous and wasnt able to recall every particular moment that I had seen Mr. Cosby in order of dates, she explained. Constand initially told police she had not been alone with Cosby before the alleged assault and that they had little contact afterward. However, she testified she had been alone in a hotel room with Cosby beforehand and had 72 phone calls with him afterward.  She also asked Cosbys representatives for free tickets for her and her family to see Cosbys   show in Toronto half a year after the alleged assault.  But she said the hotel room meeting was not romantic, and explained she made phone calls as part of her job responsibility at Temple. She got the show tickets because her family loved Cosby, and she hadnt said anything yet about what happened, she said. Defense attorneys said those were not the actions of an assault victim and suggested she was lying. I was mistaken, she said. It was a lot of confusion putting a lot of dates together. Jurors heard Cosbys side of the story    but not in his voice. Prosecutors and police detectives read aloud portions of Cosbys statements to police in 2005 and in a civil deposition from 2006. In those interviews, Cosby admitted to sexual contact with Constand and said they had had a romantic encounter. He also said the pills he gave her were    Benadryl, which he admitted can cause sleepiness. In the deposition, Cosby admitted he had previously obtained prescriptions for Quaaludes, a powerful sedative, with the intention of giving the drugs to women with whom he wanted to have sex. Prosecutors said the use of Quaaludes showed that Cosby had knowledge of what he was doing when he gave Constand the pills. How we got here, Constand first told police about the alleged assault in January 2005, a year after she says it took place. The district attorney at the time declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. She sued Cosby in a civil suit and settled for an undisclosed amount in 2006. In late 2014, dozens of women went public with accusations that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted them over the course of his lengthy comedic career.  In July 2015, a judge unsealed Cosbys deposition in that 2006 civil lawsuit. Cosbys admissions in that deposition led Montgomery County prosecutors to file charges against him. The trial started June 5. Cosby, who is legally blind and carries a cane, arrived in court each day with someone from the world of entertainment. Keshia Knight Pulliam, who played Rudy Huxtable on The Cosby Show, escorted Cosby into court on the first day of the trial.  His wife, Camille, walked into court with him Monday, her first appearance at the trial."
Jury Deadlocks in Bill Cosby Trial Mistrial Declared - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/17/2017,"NORRISTOWN, Pa.

TV Exec: NBC Made Fundamental Mistake Thinking Megyn Kelly Was Superstar - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/17/2017,"NBC News made a fundamental mistake when its network executives thought Megyn Kelly was a super star, according to a television executive CNN interviewed.  Kelly, the former Fox News talent, has come under fire for her interview with Alex Jones, which is set to air on this Sunday on her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly show. Theyve made a fundamental mistake about Megyn which is they think shes a super star, the television executive reportedly told CNN. What she is is a cable star, and that is a very different solar system.  While promoting her show, Kelly told numerous outlets that she felt like she was born to be a mainstream media star. In a leaked recording that was released this week, Kelly even tells Alex Jones, Im a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey and Larry the Cable Guy.  Kelly was resoundingly mocked after Jones released the audio. Mainstream media reporters and the families of the Sandy Hook victims also lambasted Kelly for telling Jones in the leaked audio, Its not gonna be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that.  CNN boss Jeff Zucker said that Kellys interview will only work if she is holding up a picture of the dead kids at Sandy Hook and saying, How dare you?  But as the New York Times observed, NBC has not released a transcript of Ms. Kellys interview, leading some to speculate that her interrogation of Mr. Jones over his more contentious views     for instance, that Sandy Hook was a hoax and the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks were carried out by the United States government     was less than ferocious.  As CNN pointed out, the first month of Kellys show has shown that wanting to be [Barbara] Walters, [Diane] Sawyer or [Oprah] Winfrey does not necessarily make it so. Establishing that reputation takes years. And in Kellys case, it requires a transformation from her former role as a cable news host in the center of the political fray into someone more trusted by the general public.  Had a trusted broadcast talent like Diane Sawyer or Lester Holt interviewed Jones, audiences may have given them greater benefit of the doubt, CNN noted. Critics of Kellys interview might have waited to see a Sawyer or Holt interview air before casting judgment based on a brief promo.  After her supposedly   interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Kelly did not receive stellar reviews even from her new mainstream media peers. Her interview with Erin Andrews for her second show did not draw rave reviews either. And despite NBC ginning up the hype machine in overdrive, Kellys ratings have tanked. Her debut show could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show lost to another rerun of 60 Minutes and could not even beat out a rerun of Americas Funniest Home Videos.  According to reports, NBC executives are realizing already that people are not tuning in to watch Megyn.  NBC executives are reportedly freaking out over the ratings disaster that Kelly has turned out to be, questioning the networks $15 million investment in Kelly."
"Joy Reid: Its Delicate Because While We Hope Scalise Recovers, We Cant Ignore His History of Race, Gun Control - Breitbart",Breitbart,Trent Baker,6/17/2017,"MSNBC AM Joy host Joy Reid reacted Saturday to House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalises ( ) shooting, calling it a delicate situation because she hopes he recovers but added she cannot ignore his history regarding race,   marriage and gun control.  [I]ts a delicate thing because everybody is wishing the congressman well and hoping that he recovers, but Steve Scalise has a history that weve all been forced to sort of ignore on race, Reid said. He did come to leadership after some controversy over attending a white nationalist event, which he says he didnt know what it was. He also   a bill to amend the Constitution to define marriage as between a man and a woman. He voted for the House healthcare bill, which as you said would gut health care for millions of people, including three million children, and he   a bill to repeal the ban on   weapons.

"Protesters at CNN Headquarters Rally Against Fake News, Journalistic Malpractice",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/17/2017,"Main Street Patriots organized a protest at CNN headquarters in Atlanta on Saturday to speak out against what they consider fake news reported by the outlet and other media organizations across the country, particularly when reporting on President Donald Trump. [Debbie Dooley,   of the Patriots and also a founding Tea Party activist, said at the rally that Trump supporters need to show the country that they are just as motivated and passionate about the president as those who oppose him.  Expect that we are peaceful and   citizens, Dooley said. Bikers for Trump 2020 also showed up to support the fake news protest. Founder Chris Cox said CNN and other liberal media outlets are guilty of journalistic malpractice on a daily basis.  One woman at the rally said she came as a legal immigrant from El Salvador when she was nine years old. As an immigrant to this country I hate that theyre ripping our Constitution by the way they are treating our president, she said. This is an awesome country.  We are a beacon of light and freedom to the rest of the world, the woman declared. Another man said the hateful rhetoric toward the president and conservatives can lead to incidents like the one on Wednesday when a man opened fired on congressional Republicans as they held a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. Capitol Police killed the gunman, but House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) remains in critical condition in a local hospital after multiple surgeries for his injuries. Theyre spreading fake news across the country, and were seeing the results of it, a man at the rally said."
Smiling faces of London missing haunt those left,CNN,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,6/17/2017,"London (CNN) The only smiles around the blackened husk of Grenfell Tower are on the faces of the missing. Their pictures are everywhere, taped to walls or clothes, each with a name and a desperate plea for information.  Children, their parents, young people, old people, different ethnicities    the posters reflect the diverse community that calls this part of west London home.  But as they smile from their photos, the other people gathering at the Latymer Christian Centre to see the makeshift memorials have tissues in their hands, their swollen eyes hidden behind large dark sunglasses.  Here, flowers and candles line the foot of the walls.   from the   community have written heartfelt messages to place with their offerings. And above are so many of those posters. CNN was turned away by several families as we tried to approach them to ask about their missing relatives. Always politely declining, the raw emotion of the situation etched on their faces. One young man gently waving us back, saying, Im sorry, its too soon. The time isnt right.  Since the early hours on Wednesday, rescuers have precariously scoured the remains of the   tower  knowing that they arent likely to find survivors any more. Now they search for the dead. On Friday afternoon, firefighters donning florescent orange bodysuits could be seen bravely clambering from the rooftop inside to the top floor in search of victims.   Knowing that people are missing and that others are risking their safety to try to recover them, puts the suffering of survivors into a grim perspective. Weve been out of our flats, staying with friends since Tuesday    no clothes, no money. But people are still missing and we fear for them, Nesrine Achiou, a mother of four who lives in the community tells CNN. One of them is the teaching assistant of my son who goes to nursery, Nadia. He loves her so much. Shes talking of    Nadia Choucair who works at the nearby Avondale Park Primary School. She had been at home with her mother Sirra, her husband Bassem and their three children on the 22nd floor when the fire broke out. The family havent been heard from since. Related: London fire victim was on phone to parents when she died, In the absence of word from authorities, Choucairs sister Sawsan has plastered the streets and shops nearby with posters of her six missing family members. The gutted building still stands in the background like a dark stain against a brilliantly sunny summers day. An   and brutal reminder her family are still missing.  I feel really angry inside. I cant do anything. Im just looking at that building, Im like, God help these people, Sawsan tells CNN. Im just hoping they are in hospital, theyve made it through the stairway, got out. Everyone not just my family . .. every single person in there. Im praying for them.   But others in this part of the Kensington community    like Achiou, the mom of the young boy in Nadia Choucairs class    are less certain.  She says: Ive lost any hope because weve seen the scene: how they ordered them to stay in their flats, how they stopped people from going in to help. How can anyone escape that fire? I dont believe it. I saw people knocking on windows. Stuck with no help. Nothing.  Dozens are already known to have died, and officials have said they expect that death toll to rise. Achiou says the surrounding community all know one another and laments the local council as unresponsive to their needs.   They dont respond when we need maintenance, she explains. They dont want to spend any money. This area is one of the poorest areas of the borough. If it was Notting Hill or Holland Park, then maybe this would have been prevented, but not us. The impact of the fire has been felt across the public housing estate that has the tower as its center. It was just after 1 a. m. on Wednesday when Emma Spinola stood in her nightgown, her eyes transfixed on the     as flames licked the outside of the building. Within 30 minutes, it had been completely engulfed in a hellish inferno.    Just moments before, she and her husband Liniker had scooped their two young children from their beds    leaving all their worldly possessions and the pets behind    and fled their home in one of the blocks below the tower to safety.  Theyd been evacuated as a precaution. Fire trucks and police had arrived on scene and there were fears the fire could spread to surrounding buildings on the estate.  As the hours passed, the crowd watched helplessly as smoke billowed from the building and some of its residents stumbled out. Like so many others there, Spinola wanted to rush forward and help but emergency services held them back.  I was born on the estate, Ive always lived there. And thats the only place I see as being home. Ive lost friends in that fire    its just unbelievable, Spinola says standing in a borrowed dress outside a donations shelter. And why tell them to stay inside? That door is not going to hold a fire forever. It may work for half an hour but longer? Thats not possible. And thats why were all upset because as as a community we wanted to help, she says, suddenly incensed.  Related: Harrowing tale of brothers separated in fire, Spinola looks tired but determined. She says she hasnt slept since the fire and has come to Notting Hill Community Church    one of the community centers that flung its doors open to help the dispossessed    to beg for nappies and baby food. Like others, she hasnt been allowed back home and doesnt know when that will happen. An outpouring of public generosity has seen mountains of donations come from near and far. But the Royal Borough of Kensington  Chelsea council, the management organization that oversees the estate and the UK government have fielded fierce criticism in recent days over its handling of the disaster.  We havent been able to get home since. We havent seen anyone from the estate since this happened. The council didnt take any contact details, nothing. To be honest, I dont think they really care, Spinola wearily says as she   swats some loose hair from her eyes. Its a feeling held by many residents of the Grenfell estate in the wake of the disaster.  The neighborhood has now been pushed behind a police cordon, where charred debris and trash is visible in the deserted streets behind the tape.  Many stood in clusters in the Friday afternoon sun along Bramley Road, angrily questioning how authorities could have allowed this to happen.  Related: Is Grenfell Tower Britains Katrina? In the days since the fire, the central complaints from residents have been that social housing in Londons richest borough has been inadequate for years and that the recent redevelopment around the Grenfell estate was to placate the rich who reside in the leafy streets nearby.  Grenfell Tower is just a couple streets away from row upon row of grand Victorian houses and   terraces in the gentrified and highly   Notting Hill and Holland Park residential areas.  Several   politicians including former Prime Minister David Cameron and Environment Secretary Michael Gove are believed to own houses in the vicinity.  And while it may be the same borough, for many, it might as well be different worlds.  Ive never been anywhere where the divide, the disparity between rich and poor is so pronounced, says Danny Vance, the    associate pastor coordinating community donation efforts at the church. You are literally a streets distance from   mansions and social housing.   At several of the donation centers, CNN saw few signs of council involvement. Vance said that all the work at the church was thanks to volunteers from all across London and until today, hed heard little from the council.  Residents and Londoners are so furious and dissatisfied by how the disaster has been handled that they descended on the local town hall on Friday afternoon chanting, We want justice. Holding fliers, placards and wearing   with images of missing people, protesters climbed the buildings front steps and shoved their way in. Across town, a second protest flared up in central London, bringing popular shopping destination Oxford Circus to a standstill as demonstrators staged a   during the citys rush hour.  Back in Kensington, Vance continues to shepherd boxes to a council van as we talk.  I think there has been this myth in society for probably the last 10 years that if you are poor, you are there because you are not working hard enough, you are there because you are trying to rip off the state. .. and now they are being called sponges and skivs and benefit dodgers when the people that we really know are dodging taxes are the rich. Thats what we all feel like. He continues: Something has to change    in this country, in this city. They cannot keep doing what they are doing to the poor. And with the truck loaded, he turns to thank the volunteers for their efforts and despite looking exhausted, smiles as he reveals his thoughts are starting to turn to Sundays sermon.  Jesus doesnt care if you are rich, doesnt care if you are poor but he stands with those who are broken and thats what our church is about, Vance says as he cradles his son in his arms.  It needs to be something thats encouraging and hopeful but there will be anger about whats happened because this cannot happen again."
"E3 Hands-On with LawBreakers: Tons of Style, Little Substance - Breitbart",Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/17/2017,"LawBreakers is the next big   release from Unreal and Gears of War developer Cliff Bleszinski, but does it live up to the hype?[  Cliff Bleszinski (formerly known as CliffyB) is best known for his work on the Unreal and Gears of War franchises, both of which went on to spawn multiple sequels and are considered classics among both fans and critics. Bleszinskis latest project, released under his own company Boss Key Productions, is a   shooter with an   twist that I got to get time   with at E3. LawBreakers lets players choose one of nine different classes spread across 18 characters to fight to the death in a team   shooter. The classes feature many character types that players of team shooters will be familiar with there are heavy shooters that utilize rocket launchers and grenades to decimate large groups of opponents, while also characters that rely on blades and speed boosts to slice their way through the competition at close range. LawBreakers focuses heavily on the futuristic elements of the game, both in promotional material and gameplay itself.   is a huge feature that is utilized throughout the game, with players moving between regular gravity and   zones constantly, forcing them to adapt their playstyle and utilize movement abilities in order to keep up with the   nature of the game. While the   elements provide a slightly new playstyle, overall LawBreakers suffers from a lack of originality. To the experienced FPS fan, LawBreakers comes across as an attempt to innovate in ways that arent as new and groundbreaking as LawBreakers presents them as being. Many of the mechanics we see in LawBreakers such as   are similar to the movement systems of shooters like Call of Duty: Black Ops III and the Titanfall franchise, while special character abilities are quite similar to the abilities in other hero shooters like Overwatch. While the game introduces some interesting design elements and in many cases attempts to rely on their futuristic style, the visuals can often be quite lackluster. Textures in many areas look bland and recycled, while many character designs are hit and miss. The LawBreakers team does seem to have chosen to appeal to the eSports market with much of their branding however which may be the games best chance at success. Overall my time with LawBreakers left me with the impression of a fun shooter to kill some time with but unlikely to win any awards for groundbreaking innovation. Hopefully, the full release of LawBreakers will reveal a bit more depth by its August 8 release date.

A lot of clickservatives saw yesterday as a grim blessing, Wilson tweeted the morning after a gunman who hated Trump and Republicans opened fire on Republicans who were practicing for the Congressional Baseball Game. After saying that Trump supporters were dead right about the media double standard, Wilson claimed the thing they really loved       even at the cost of a lunatic Bernie Bro almost committing mass murder was       the chance to try to blame opposition to Trump on the shooting.

Im Triggered (@StopThisMadnes1) June 15, 2017,  Most Americans were praying for Scalise, staffers, and the heroic Capitol Police officers who were shot in the line of duty the morning after the assassination attempt. But this apparently was apparently the first thing on Wilsons unhinged mind when he woke up. Wilson, though, seems to be doing a bit of projecting since he once politicized, out of all things, a rape threat against his daughter to try to score political points against Breitbart News. John Nolte wrote at the time that in all the years Ive been on social media, I have never seen anyone     not even the lowest Leftist     use a threat of rape against their own child as a political talking point or debating point against a political opponent.  After he politicized the rape threat against his daughter, Wilson was immediately asked if he had gone to law enforcement and whether law enforcement officials asked him not to publicize the rape threat on social media. During the 2016 election cycle, Wilson, who constantly bemoans what he deems is crass behavior by anyone who is not a fellow Never Trumper, went on national television and said the donor class needed to put a bullet in Donald Trump.  Theyre still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump, Wilson told MSNBCs   audience. And thats a fact.  Wilson also likened Ann Coulter to a prostitute and asked Coulter if Trump paid her more for anal."

Hannity on the Media: What Were Seeing Now Is This Unelected Fourth Branch of Govt Looking for Retribution - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/17/2017,"Friday on Fox News Channels Hannity, host Sean Hannity used his Opening Monologue to criticize the media for what he said was an effort to overturn the results of last Novembers presidential election.  Transcript as follows: The unelected fourth branch of government, the deep state, is trying to overturn the results of Novembers election and throw this president out of office! So how did a bunch of unelected bureaucrats get so much power, feel so emboldened that think they can undermine a duly elected president of the United States and just take over? Plus, after this weeks   assassination attempt on Republican lawmakers, the lefts come together kumbaya moment, like I said last night, is nothing more than an illusion. It is a farce to hide the lefts true intentions. We will expose all of this hypocrisy in tonights very important Opening Monologue.  All right, so the unelected fourth branch of government is now being aided and abetted by the destroy Trump media, all in a massive effort to damage and destroy President Trump. Now, this week alone, we have seen unprecedented and potentially criminal leaks from the deep state to the liberal Washington Post. Now, the liberal smear machine is masquerading as a news outlet in their reporting, citing, of course, once again anonymous sources that the special counsel is investigating the president for possible obstruction of justice and that Robert Mueller is also looking into Jared Kushners finances and business dealings. OK, how is it possible that they dare to leak information almost every single day without any fear of consequences? And by the way, theyre wrong so often. Present Trump responding to that report today, tweeting, quote, I am being investigated for firing the FBI director by the man who told me to fire the FBI director. Thats a witch hung.  Now, the president, of course, is referring to the deputy attorney general, Rosenstein, who in a   memo laid out the strongest case on why Comey need to be fired. Now Rosenstein     now he wants an investigation by the special counsel to investigate why the president fired Comey and whether or not this was the right thing to do! This is insanity! And by the way, the special counsel now has 13 attorneys. And on top of that, including Hillary Clintons attorney and multiple attorneys that donated to both Obama and Hillary Clinton. Now, predictably, the destroy Trump media     theyre jumping all over this. They are, of course, hoping that it will lead to President Trumps downfall. Let me remind you the Washington Post, ABC News, The New York Times, CNN, NBC     they have all gotten it wrong on this issue. They all at this point with the American public should have zero credibility. So we have to take these latest   smoking gun reports come out late night every night with a grain of salt. Last night, the deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein     he issued this statement about trusting these stories about the, quote (ph) coming out of the fake news media. He said this. He said, Americans should exercise caution before accepting as true any stories attributed to, quote (ph) anonymous officials, particularly when they do not identify the country, let along the branch or the agency of government with which the alleged sources supposedly are affiliated. Americans should be skeptical about anonymous allegations.  Now, the Department of Justice has a long established policy to neither confirm nor deny such allegations. You know what? I dont trust that (ph) either, at this point. On top of that, James Comey     remember, he testified last week the media has been so dead wrong when it comes to stories about Russia. And by the way, while all that is alarming, it proves everything we have been saying on this program. This deep state, this fourth branch of government, as were calling it, doesnt care about getting the truth to you, the American people. And of course, the media     theyre the willing accomplices. Their goal is the exact opposite here. They are selectively leaking information, intelligence information that is meant to damage, in this case, the president of United States of America, which is exactly what we have been seeing now almost on a nightly basis. Heres a perfect example. James Comey told President Trump he wasnt under investigation. Somehow, thats the only one thing that never got leaked to the press. Why? The reason should be obvious. And whats worse is the growing targets for the deep state. Theyve been successful in totally slowing down the presidents agenda, Congresss agenda. Now, so far, they havent been able to stop him, which means the deep state is now going after anyone whos even close to the president, including his family and White House advisers, and by the way, even people in the media. The deep state now plans to create as much collateral damage as possible, targeting everyone and everyone (sic) from the president straight on down. So what were seeing now is this unelected fourth branch of government looking for retribution, overturning a duly elected election. (sic) And by the way, theyre not going to stop until this president is either stopped or thrown out of office. Heres the problem. Whoever is leaking this information to the media     they need to be arrested. They need to be prosecuted. Every one of them needs to be put in jail. Why hasnt every Obama holdover been fired? Why have the leakers, you know, not been discovered and arrested at this point? Now, these people have now become a clear and present danger to this country and to you and the things that you care about deeply. Now, because these people now have, of course, done this to the country, well, that raises a lot of questions. Of course, now we have the left and their vicious and vile daily hatred that is now tearing this country apart and creating a climate where what we saw last week is now in some ways even encouraged by some. Now, last nights   show of unity     remember, Im not falling for it, the kumbaya moment at the congressional baseball game. It was nothing more than an illusion. Now, this weeks   assassination attempt on these Republican lawmakers is the culmination of endless vitriolic rage, animus, hatred towards the president and Republicans. Im not saying anybody but this individual is responsible, but this atmosphere is so unhealthy. And those that are unhealthy     are they susceptible to potential influence of daily lies, misinformation, conspiracy theories? Remember this stunning video from this week. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (EXPLETIVE DELETED) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do we know where hes at? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: What? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Do we know where hes at? (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now, after everything that we have seen, can anyone say that theyre surprised that a   lunatic went on a shooting rampage? For example, just this week, an opening night performance, Shakespeares Julius Caesar, New York City, or course, featured a Donald Trump lookalike getting what? Savagely murdered. Then of course, this most graphic example that we always warn you about before putting it up on he screen, Kathy Griffin, CNN host, posing like an ISIS fighter with a fake and bloody and severed head of President Trump. And thats just a few examples of this   vitriol. Remember back in January, Madonna literally threatening, fantasizing about blowing up the White House. Remember this? (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) MADONNA, SINGER: Yes, Im angry. Yes, I am outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House. Now, leftists, Hollywood liberals     they arent alone in viciously attacking the president. Then you got the destroy Trump media. Now, for months, 11 months almost, they have done the exact same thing, if not a lot worse. Take a look at what   news looks like. Its real fake news, though. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I understand where you were coming from. I understand why you liked him. But this man is lying to you. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Trumps critics, those who are worried about this president and this White House, saw a live special television event brought to you by narcissism, thin skin, chaos and deeply personal grievances. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This was a whitelash. This was a whitelash against a changing country. It was a whitelash against a black president, in part. And thats the part where the pain comes. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: When he said today America first, it was not just the racial     I mean, the     I shouldnt say racial, the Hitlerian background to it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This is a very sad night for the country. You cant polish this turd. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE:     fake news. What if you had called him a fake president? UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Hes there with his wife. Heres there with his whole family, as I say, like the Romanovs. Hes got     hes got Jared, who might be a part of this story (INAUDIBLE) And hes got his daughter, Ivanka. Its like a traveling royal Romanov family! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You cant defend what the president of the United States just said. (CROSSTALK) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If he took a dump on his desk, you would defend it. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And now were supposed to believe all of these media folks and Democrats are preaching unity? But yet they have done nothing but smear, slander, besmirch this president for months. In case you forgot. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: This executive order was   and  . UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Republican leaders and President Trump dont give a (EXPLETIVE DELETED) about the people they were trying to hurt! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I will fight every day until he is impeached. Impeach 45! (CHEERS AND APPLAUSE) UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Impeach 45! UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is a bunch of scumbags. Thats what they are    UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Those are very strong words, Congressman. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE:     who are all organized around making money. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: We see nothing that we can work     that I can work with President Bush (sic) on. Im trying really hard to find something positive. This morning, he had three tweets. I was thinking he was more of a creature that stalked the night, that these just came out at night like a vampire (INAUDIBLE) tweet us (ph) these things. But now its spread to the morning. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: And after Wednesdays   assassination attempt, the HuffingtonPost     they had to take down an article calling for the presidents execution. Take a look at the headline we showed you last night, Impeachment is no longer enough, Donald Trump must face justice.  And heres the   Impeachment, removal from office are only the first steps. For America to be redeemed, Donald Trump must be prosecuted for treason. If convicted in a court of law, executed.  Beyond disturbing. But there are plenty of other examples. Earlier this week, liberal Hollywood actor,   activist Mark Ruffalo     he called on his followers to sign a petition that demands NBC News stop hiring conservatives for   positions, white conservatives? Weve also seen people like Robert de Niro and Mickey Rourke and Marilyn Manson advocating for violence against this president. And outside of Hollywood, then, of course, you have groups like Black Lives Matter. What do we want, dead cops. When do we want them, now. Pigs in a blanket, fry `em like bacon. Hillary Clinton supported that group. President Obama met with them in the White House! Theyve been spewing hate for years. And by the way, where was their criticism of Kathy Griffin and her ISIS pose? Take a look at Black Lives Matter. (END VIDEO CLIP) PROTESTERS: Pigs in a blanket, fry `em like bacon! Pigs in a blanket, fry `em like bacon! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) PROTESTERS: Now! UNIDENTIFIED MALE: (INAUDIBLE) PROTESTERS: Now! (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Also, we have all seen the    anger and rage that is springing up all over college campuses where     you know, showing you video     Berkeley, California, earlier this year, protesters starting a riot. Why? Because a conservative was going to speak at the university, the home of the Free Speech Movement. Now, while all these examples of hatred are shocking and alarming, theyre not new. Now, the roots of the lefts rage go back decades, if not further. In fact, it is part of the movements DNA. You know, groups like the Mayday Labor Movement, the Weather Underground, remember them, led by Barack Obamas pals, Bill Ayers and Bernadine Dohrn, the Occupy Wall Street movement all started with, subscribed to radical     ideology advocating for using violence to their advantage in their political objectives. So while the Democrats and the left are putting their hate on pause for 24 hours last night, not even 24 hours, you can bet theyre only getting started when it comes to the president, conservatives, Republicans in this country.

Flashback: Megyn Kelly: I Was Born to Be MSM Talent - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/17/2017,"Former Fox News talent Megyn Kelly revealed in interviews before the debut of her new NBC show that she has always felt that she was born to be a mainstream media personality.  I understand what that show is. That show is a show I was born to do, she told the New York Times while promoting her Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly show, which could not even beat a 60 Minutes rerun in its debut. Kelly made similar comments at NBCs upfront presentations last month. She bluntly told Politico during her round of interviews, I was not born to be a political news anchor.  The audience enjoyed the show and Im grateful for it, she said of her Fox News primetime show. But it wasnt who I was and it isnt who I am.  Kelly told the Daily Beast that cable news offers no time for wining and dining you gotta get right to it.  Her new show, though, will allow her time for more nuance and relationship building with her guests. Her show, she says, has allowed me to open up more and show more of who I am and show a range of emotion and personality and sides of me that wasnt possible when I was in   cable news.  Like many others who used their positions at    outlets to get adoration from the mainstream press to eventually land a mainstream media gig, Kelly got the requisite pats on the head from The Opposition Partys members during the 2016 presidential campaign. Using the prominent platform she somehow got on Fox News, Kelly attacked and attempted to kneecap   Trump, most egregiously during a GOP presidential debate when she took Trumps comments out of context in order to paint him as a sexist pig. The mainstream media howled their approval. And in hindsight, it seems as if Kelly, who conservatives always suspected was more liberal than she let on, was auditioning for them. As for Trump, Kelly told the Daily Beast that she wouldnt say no to a sit down with him but its not something I am pursuing right now.  Its just nice to not be at the pointy point of the spear for every news story he generated, she told the Times. But Kelly said she was excited to do what she feels she was born to do.  She told the Daily Beast that she has learned it was extremely hard to be a    mother.  I was driving the housekeeper crazy. Poor Carla. Nobody was as happy as Carla was when I went back to work, she said. When news of NBCs hiring of Kelly broke, one executive reportedly told CNN that the degree of difficulty would be extremely high for Kelly and if she does not succeed, she could end up fading into obscurity.  Kellys first two programs have failed to beat reruns of 60 Minutes. Her last even lost to a rerun of Americas Funniest Home Videos. NBC News is reportedly freaking out over the ratings disaster that is Kelly."
Malcolm Nance Doubles Down on Calling Stephen Miller Baby Goebbels - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart TV,6/17/2017,"During the online Overtime segment of HBOs Real Time with Bill Maher, MSNBC terrorism analyst and former intel analyst Malcolm Nance doubled down on his earlier comparison of Trump adviser Stephen Miller to Nazi propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels.  Breitbart News    Alex Marlow said that Nance was liked by both sides of the aisle until he became a hysterical person, like you are.  The rest of the panel denied that Nance was hysterical, and Marlow pushed back that IT WAS HYSTERICAL FOR Nance TO HAVE called one of the key members of Trumps administration Goebbels.  Nance responded, Thats not true. I called him baby Goebbels.  The remark drew applause from the audience. Host Bill Maher then argued that you can compare someone to Hitler without the part about killing all the Jews.  Maher continued that President Trump is very similar to where Hitler was      in 1942, when Hitler was going crazy, and the high command, right? Was like, Oh my God, what are we going to do? Because hes telling us that we cant withdraw from Stalingrad. That seems to me where people are in the Republican Party     are going to with Donald Trump now. Not that Im saying hes an  .

"Trump Touts Apprenticeship Initiative: There Is Dignity in Every Honest Job, And There Is Nobility in Every Honest Worker - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/17/2017,"During Fridays Weekly Address, President Trump touted the Apprenticeship Initiative executive order and said, Today, this is the message I want every young American to hear: there is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker.   Transcript as Follows: My fellow Americans, This week, our nation was shocked and horrified when a gunman opened fire on a Member of Congress.  Five people were wounded in the assault, including a member of House Leadership     my good friend, Steve Scalise. Steve is beloved across Washington, he embodies everything public service is about     hes dedicated to his constituents, devoted to his values, and deeply committed to his country.  I visited Steve, his wife, and his family in the hospital as he continues to fight for his recovery.  435 Members of Congress, and 300 million Americans, are pulling for him, praying for him, and pledging to him our full and total support. We continue to hold all of those wounded and fighting for recovery in our hearts and prayers, including Matt Mika, who was also badly wounded. In that terrible crime, we also witnessed the incredible heroism of Capitol Police.  Special Agent Crystal Griner     who I also had the honor of meeting during my visit to the Hospital     raced into gunfire, along with Special Agent David Bailey.  They saved the lives of our Members of Congress and prevented that dark day from becoming a tragedy beyond imagination.  They, like so many other courageous police officers, represent the very best of us. We salute them, and we also salute members of Alexandria Police, Fire and Rescue. Though we have our differences, what unites us is so much stronger: our love of country, our devotion to its people.  Now more than ever, these values must guide us     and bring us closer together.  Let us always remember that our job is to serve and represent the whole American People     and that we are all children of the same God. This week, my Administration continues our focus on providing economic opportunity for all. On Thursday, I signed an Executive Order to launch a groundbreaking new Apprenticeship Initiative that will help young Americans learn the skills they need to find a rewarding career, earn a great living, and support themselves and their families. We are celebrating the dignity of work and the greatness of the American Worker. American citizens have worked every job, every occupation, no matter what it might be     no matter how grueling, how challenging, or even how dangerous.  They wash the windows on our tallest skyscrapers they create works of art from burning fire and molten steel they mine the earth and dive the ocean depths to bring energy into our cities and towns they care for the sick, the elderly, and the wounded and they lay the bricks, mortar, rebar, and concrete that give us places to live, to work, and to thrive. Today, this is the message I want every young American to hear: there is dignity in every honest job, and there is nobility in every honest worker. Our Apprenticeship Initiative will make it dramatically easier for employers, industry groups and unions to create exciting new apprenticeship programs that place students into   careers. Instead of being racked with crushing student debt, those who participate will earn while they learn     think of that: earn while they learn. Under our plan, young Americans will have a pathway to exciting and fulfilling careers.  They will become brilliant technicians who revitalize American manufacturing.  They will become welders who forge from fire amazing works of iron and steel and art.  And they will become entrepreneurs who revolutionize entire industries.  And these striving American citizens, including millions of talented young American women with tremendous potential, will become the programmers who change the world with the next great technological advance. Every American deserves a path to a great job that they truly love. That begins with the right education     one that gives students the foundation for a lifetime of success. Every day, as your President, I will be committed to this goal. Thank you, God bless you, and God bless America.  Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"

Grave concerns over the Trump administrations view toward civil rights prompts new investigation,Business Insider,David Choi,6/17/2017,"An independent, bipartisan federal commission tasked with   advising President Donald Trump and Congress on     issues approved a   investigation that will examine how   the Trump administrations current budgets and staffing levels   allow civil rights offices to perform,  reported   Friday.     The United States Commission on Civil Rights unanimously approved   an investigation, citing concerns about the impacts that budget   cuts and staffing shortages could have on agencies designed to   uphold   protections     The investigation was prompted after funding and personnel cuts   were announced, some as high as 23% in departments that oversee     issues.     These proposed cuts would result in a dangerous reduction of   civil rights enforcement across the country, leaving communities   of color, LGBT people, older people, people with disabilities,   and other marginalized groups exposed to greater risk of   discrimination, the statement said.     For 60 years, Congress has charged the Commission to monitor   Federal civil rights enforcement and recommend necessary change,   said commission chair Catherine Lhamon. We take this charge   seriously, and we look forward to reporting our findings to   Congress, the President, and the American people.      The United States Commission on Civil Rights listed seven   entities for their concern, including the Department of   Education, Department of Justice, Department of Housing and Urban   Development, and the Environmental Protection Agency.     Actions by the [Department of Justice] indicate it is minimizing   its civil rights efforts, the statement said. For example, a   majority of the Commission criticized DOJs decision to site   Immigrations and Customs Enforcement officers in courthouses as a   dangerous impediment to access to justice for all Americans.     Ultimately, the power to enforce any changes made after the   investigation will be in the hands of Congress, according to NBC.   The commission is scheduled to report their findings at the end   of 2019.  An independent, bipartisan federal commission. .."
Immigration Patriots Thrilled About Trump Tossing Out DAPA,Breitbart,John Binder,6/17/2017,"After President Trumps administration announced it would toss out an   amnesty program for up to five million illegal aliens,   immigration hawks are cheering as they have a   hope in the White House. [In a joint statement, Department of Homeland Security Secretary (DHS) John Kelly and Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) amnesty program would officially be tossed out.  Immigration patriots say that are thrilled by the major immigration decision. NumbersUSA and its 8 million activists are thrilled that Secretary Kelly has rescinded the DAPA amnesty, partially fulfilling one of President Trumps key campaign promises, NumebersUSAs Chris Chmielenski said in a statement. Chmielenski said that by the Trump administration ending the DAPA amnesty program, American workers have been spared having to compete with more immigrants in a scarce American job market. Although this unconstitutional executive amnesty had been temporarily blocked by the courts, it threatened to issue 5 million new work permits to illegal aliens who would mostly compete with   American workers who still face   unemployment rates and declining wages, Chmielenski continued. Breitbart Texas covered the trial in South Texas in Judge Andrew Hanen where the judge not only blocked the order but had harsh words for Obama Administration lawyers. President of the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR) Dan Stein praised Trumps decision to end DAPA as a win for the rule of law. Yesterdays action by the administration also acknowledges that granting de facto amnesty to millions of people who knowingly violated U. S. immigration laws is also bad public policy that harms the interests of the American people and encourages more illegal immigration, Stein said in a statement. Many working class Americans voted for President Trump because of his promise to combat illegal immigration and secure U. S. jobs for American workers. They are the major beneficiaries of this action.  Though the Trump administration kept their promise on throwing out the   amnesty program, it has been less active in ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which essentially gives amnesty to young illegal aliens. In his statement praising Trump, Chmielenski asked the White House to keep their campaign promise and end the DACA program. We hope President Trump now will keep his entire promise by ordering an end to the Obama Administrations other unconstitutional amnesty, the DACA program which continues to issues new work permits to those here illegally, Chmielenski said. Stein issued a similar statement on DACA, saying the program was just as legally questionable and hurtful to Americans as DAPA. Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) granted to more than 780, 000 illegal aliens who arrived in the U. S. as minors, was a similar example of an executive overreach that was based on the same flawed legal principle, Stein said. Clearly, DACA raises the same legal questions that ultimately resulted in the termination of DAPA. This calls into question the legitimacy of DACA as well.

Netflix Flip-Flops on Net Neutrality - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,6/17/2017,"After Netflix CEO Reed Hastings dismissed net neutrality as an issue that was only important to the Netflix of ten years ago at a conference two weeks ago, the companys Twitter account sent out a tweet claiming they would never outgrow the cause. [The tweet linked to BattleForTheNet. com, a site dedicated to a Day of Action on July 12th where multiple companies will protest against efforts by the FCC to roll back their current rulings on neutrality online.

This is in contrast to the comments made by Hastings at Recodes Code Conference last month. Hastings claimed that Netflix is too big a company to bother with issues like net neutrality that wouldnt greatly affect them anymore: Its not our primary battle at this point. Other people it is, and thats an important thing, and were supportive through the industry association, but I think youre right that we dont have the special vulnerability to it.

WaPo Reporter: We Had Fun Cataloguing World Leaders Whove Mocked Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/17/2017,"A Washington Post reporter admitted that she and her team had a little bit of fun cataloguing all of the foreign leaders who have mocked President Donald Trump in recent weeks.  Were having a little bit of fun kinda going through some of the recent examples of world leaders who either feel free to mock trump in public or behind [like] the Australian prime minister, the Posts Anne Gearan told MSNBCs Brian Williams on Friday evening. She gleefully   an article last week titled, Trump said foreign leaders wouldnt laugh at the U. S. Now theyre laughing at him.  The article states that though Trump declared in the Rose Garden while withdrawing from the Paris Climate Accord that foreign leaders wont be laughing at us, Trump has since been the butt of jokes in capitals around the world.  The article notes that the trolling is picking up and points out that Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull recently was caught making fun in a leaked recording. The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls, Turnbull reportedly said while mocking Trump. Not the fake polls. Theyre the ones were not winning in. Were winning in the real polls. You know, the online polls.  As the Post noted, Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Isabella Lovi, Norway Prime Minister Erna Solberg, Frances President Emmanuel Macron and former Mexican President Vicente Fox all have trolled or mocked Trump in recent weeks. It is no surprise that reporters at the Post like seeing Trump mocked. The Posts Margaret Sullivan, who used to be the New York Times public editor, recently asked if the mainstream media were being terribly unfair to Trump. Her response? Hell, no.  Politicians have no right to expect equally balanced positive and negative coverage, or anything close to it, Sullivan wrote. If a president is doing a rotten job, its the duty of the press to report how and why hes doing a rotten job.  She added that the idea of balance is suspect on its face.  After the Post published leaked information from intelligence officials that alleged President Donald Trump passed along classified intelligence information to the Russians last month, the Posts newsroom reportedly erupted in cheers as readers kept clicking on the story. The papers     Glenn Kessler, immediately Tweeted that there was Applause in the newsroom as the   scoop breaks the Hollywood Access record for most readers per second.

U.N. Report Blames Israel for Palestinian Men Beating Their Wives,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/17/2017,"A new report by a United Nations expert, and submitted to the U. N. Human Rights Council, blames Israel in part for Palestinian men beating their wives     offering more fuel to those in the Trump administration seeking to leave the council over its   bias. [The document, first reported by U. N. Watch, which monitors the international body, was written by Dubravka imonovi     the Special Rapporteur on violence against women     who filed dual reports based on her trips to the region in 2016. The report in question focuses on the causes and consequences of violence against women in the region.  In her filing on Israel, imonovi highlights what she claims is a clear linkage between the Israeli occupation and Palestinian domestic abuse: While recognizing the imperatives related to security and stability in the region, the Rapporteur highlights the clear linkage between the prolonged occupation and [violence against women] and she notes, like her predecessor, that the occupation does not exonerate the State of Palestine from its due human rights obligation to prevent, investigate, punish and provide remedies for acts of   violence (GBV) in the areas and for persons under its jurisdiction or effective control. The report states:  Several testimonies the Rapporteur collected highlighted that the economic situation, the level of unemployment and the pressure of the occupation have a greater impact on womens and childrens lives, making them more vulnerable to domestic violence, in particular in Gaza, due to the constant pressure felt by the blockade and the recurring cycles of conflict, and the overcrowding that limits their mobility and privacy. While imonovi does partly blame traditions and culture within Palestinian society, her report still fingered Israel in those sections. For instance, the report claims that decades of Israeli occupation in parallel with the continuation of patriarchal attitude in Palestinian society expose women to subordination and continuing violence.  However, while in some places the report does state that what it calls the State of Palestine has a responsibility, it also mitigates that responsibility in other sections, at one point claiming: the occupation is a real obstacle to the States due diligence obligation to prevent violence against women in areas where it does not have full jurisdiction        Israeli occupation refers to Israels presence in the West Bank, which is dotted with historic Jewish towns and Jewish holy sites and eastern Jersualem, home of the Western Wall and Temple Mount. The Human Rights Council has long been accused of   bias. U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley has repeatedly called the council out on its bias, and threatened that the U. S. may leave that body if it does not reform its membership and focus less on Israel. At a debate on the report at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, U. N. Watch representative Hillel Neuer criticized imonovi and accused her of infantilizing Palestinian men, and questioned why she did not spend more time on the issue of tradition and culture, arguing that Palestinian TV gives advice to husbands on how to hit their wives. imonovi responded by clarifying that any man who is beating his wife is responsible     he is a perpetrator of violence.   But when we are speaking about human rights responsibility and due diligence responsibility, then we are at a different level, because states have due diligence responsibility to prevent violence against women and to establish measures to prevent such violence to punish perpetrators of violence and to provide compensation to victims, she said.

Dem Strategist James Devine Launches Hashtag #HuntRepublicanCongressmen After Steve Scalise Shooting,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/17/2017,"A New Jersey Democratic strategist is capitalizing on the shooting of Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) by launching the hashtags #HuntRepublicans and #HuntRepublicanCongressmen, and he is showing no signs of backing down, claiming the chickens came home to roost. [James Devine, a longtime political strategist in the Garden State, tweeted in the wake of the shooting at a Republican baseball practice in Alexandria on Wednesday that we are in a war with selfish, foolish  narcissistic rich people:  We are in a war with selfish, foolish  narcissistic rich people.

James Devine (@James_J_Devine) June 14, 2017,  Perhaps responding to the anger directed at him online, he then clumsily tried to justify the hateful tweets by repeating a tired Democratic talking point, attempting to link Scalise to David Duke: In 2002, Scalise was a speaker at the   Unity  Rights Organization (EURO) a group founded by David Duke. #HuntRepublicans,     James Devine (@James_J_Devine) June 14, 2017,  Amazingly, in light of his tweets, he told MyCentralJersey. com that the shooting was the result of escalating rhetoric and vitriol that has been evident in our political system culminating with the election of our president and the chickens came home to roost, you know? While he said he does not condone violent acts, in apparent contradiction to his hashtags, he told the outlet, If you want to behave in an uncivilized and violent manner, which I do not condone, but if you want to operate under those circumstances then you have to be prepared to accept those consequences.

Florida Fisherman Loses $2.8 Million Prize After He Fails Polygraph Test - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/17/2017,"A Florida fisherman lost $2. 8 million in prize money after he was disqualified from a fishing tournament in Maryland for failing a polygraph test. [A federal judge ruled Wednesday that Phillip Heasley, of Naples, the winner of the 2016 White Marlin Open tournament in Ocean City, Maryland that took place in August 2016, would be disqualified from the tournament, and 13 other contestants who won other competitions would split the prize money, the Baltimore Sun reported.  Heasley and his teammates won the tournament after catching a 76.  white marlin but failed the two polygraph tests required under tournament rules. Polygraph tests are required in most   competitions to verify that large prizes are won fairly and are often conducted by private investigators. Officials say he violated the rules of the tournament for catching the fish before the time contestants were allowed to catch fish, at 8:30 a. m. on August 9, 2016, and lied about it in the polygraph. The tournament organizers made the decision to withhold his prize as a result. After a   trial ten months later, a judge ruled in favor of the tournaments organizers and against Heasley, Delmarva Now reports. Throughout the case, the intention of the White Marlin Open directors has been to protect the integrity of the tournament and to ensure that the rules are applied fairly for all participants, officials for the White Marlin Open wrote in a statement on Facebook Wednesday regarding the ruling. The White Marlin Open is pleased that its reputation for integrity, built over its    history, has been upheld.  Heasleys attorney was disappointed with the results of the ruling, but maintained that his client followed the tournaments rules. His lawyer added that his team is reviewing the decision and looking at their options going forward. Heasley can appeal the judges decision for up to 30 days after the judge handed down his decision."
This new animation shows how close Antarctica is to losing an iceberg the size of Delaware,Business Insider,Dave Mosher,6/17/2017,"A block of ice about the size of Delaware could break off of   Antarctica within days, researchers suggest. And a new   animation shows just how close the humongous iceberg is to   calving.     Antarcticas Larsen C ice shelf     one of the largest such shelves   in the southern continent     began developing the crack in 2010.   That rift lengthened and widened over the years, but has grown   most rapidly since 2016. In early June,  showed the rift had split, turned north,   and begun moving toward the Southern Ocean.     Now  of Swansea University in the UK, who is closely   monitoring Larsen C with his colleagues, has released a new   animation of the rifts rapid growth.     Waiting for the final [jump]! Luckman said in a  on June 16.     The images reveal how the rift jumps as it  slows when it hits denser   ice, and speeds up again when it encounters more weak ice. In the   animation, the ocean is shown in emerald green (top right) the   Larsen C ice shelf is the light blue patch, and the glacier   behind it is white.       Its impossible to say precisely when the rift will snap the ice   off, but Dan McGrath, a scientist with the US Geological Survey,   thinks it wont be long.     I would expect it to occur quite rapidly, within days or weeks,   McGrath, who researches Larsen C,  on June 1. The ice block makes up about 10% of   Larsen Cs total area.     According to  the crack   lengthened 11 miles from May 25 to May 31. They also noted that   the rift only has to extend through 8 more miles of ice for it to   birth a colossal iceberg.     The rift tip appears also to have turned significantly towards   the ice front, indicating that the time of calving is probably   very close, wrote Luckman and OLeary, who collaborate on the   Impact of Melt on Ice Shelf Dynamics and Stability project, also   known as Project MIDAS. There appears to be very little to   prevent the iceberg from breaking away completely.        More recent satellite data, released on June 6 and June 12,   suggests the rift has shown no significant change . .. since May   31 according to Project MIDAS  (which is run by OLeary). He    that new satellite data wouldnt arrive in until Sunday, June 18.     When the iceberg does shed, it will not significantly raise sea   levels, since its already sitting in the ocean. But Luckman and   OLeary said that without the    iceberg, the rest of   Larsen C will be less stable than it was prior to the rift.     Put another way: Theres a slim chance that the entire Larsen C   ice shelf, and an ancient glacier behind it, could later   disintegrate and fall into the sea.     The chaos wouldnt be unprecedented in recorded history. In 2002,   a neighboring ice shelf called Larsen B collapsed and broke up in   the Southern Ocean. If Larsen C and its accompanying glacier   collapse, sea levels might rise by up to four inches.     More details about the rift in Antarcticas Larsen C ice shelf   are available in .

British Islamist Journalist Who Worked With BBC has Citizenship Revoked,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,6/17/2017,"A   Muslim working for an Islamist blogging website in Syria has become the first person to have his citizenship revoked since 2015, for posing a threat to the nation. [Akif Razaq, 30, from Birmingham, was working for On The Ground News (OGN) a site set up by U. S. born convert Bilal Abdul Kareem, who has collaborated with and written for   Islamist blogs 5Pillars and Islam21C.  Alleged extremist sympathiser Mr. Kareem, who is on a U. S. kill list has also contributed to reports for Channel 4, the BBC, Sky News, and the Dutch program Newseur. Announcing the news in a YouTube video, Mr. Razaq said he found out about the impending punishment when police served his family with a notice on the 24th of May this year. The notice, seen by The Times, said an assessment had confirmed Mr. Razaq is aligned with an   aligned group and that his return to the county would present a risk to the national security of the United Kingdom.  Speaking on YouTube, he said he planned to fight the decision, but said: Theres a job still to do [in Syria]       so even if I didnt have my citizenship revoked, I would still say no its not the time to go home yet.  I wouldnt mind going home he added, but the jobs not finished yet. I came here [and] Bashar   was in charge     hes still in charge. There was oppression going on     theres still oppression going on. Mr. Razaq first travelled to Syria with an aid convoy in 2013, before joining OGN in 2015. There appears to be no evidence that he has used weapons or received combat training in Syria, The Times reports. Mr. Kareem, who is still a U. S. citizen, was recently put on a kill list by American authorities because of alleged links to terrorist organisations such at  . Rami Jarrah, a Syrian opposition activist, said: They [ONG] know how dangerous what they are doing is, and how easily they could be branded as terrorists, yet they continue to provide a platform for extremist elements. [They] have failed to report on abuses committed by a number of extremist groups, simply because they are aligned with them he added."
Acquittal in Philando Castile case is deja vu,CNN,Joey Jackson,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Yet another black man dead, and yet another police officer exonerated for killing him. Seems a lot like deja vu.  Havent we seen this tragic movie before    all over the country? When investigated, the police are not indicted. And when indicted, they are not convicted. The venue this time    Minnesota the victim, motorist Philando Castile.   So what did Castile do that led to this tragic fate? He was driving with a broken tail light while supposedly fitting the description of a robbery suspect. His girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds, was in the passenger seat while her    daughter was in the back. Upon being stopped, he reported to Officer Jeronimo Yanez that he had a firearm on him.  Thereafter, when attempting to produce his drivers license as instructed, and trying to unbuckle his seat belt to do so, he was shot dead in a hail of seven bullets.   Thats it! No verbal confrontation. No physical altercation. No disrespect of the police officer. No questioning of law enforcement authority. Instead, Castile was totally and completely compliant. Yet, he lost his life anyway. Really! Whats even more compelling is that Officer Yanez appeared unhinged in the viral Facebook Live video. Even after firing the barrage of fatal shots,  Yanez stands outside the car, with his gun still trained on a bleeding and dying Castile while yelling hysterically: I told him not to reach for it. I told him to get his hands open.   Contrast this with Reynolds calm and composed demeanor, while she addresses Yanez as sir, and reminds him that what he asked Castile to do was produce his drivers license. While we have no choice but to respect the judicial process, and accept the jury verdict, can we really blame people for being outraged, and taking to the streets in peaceful protest? How did a jury not see what the rest of the world did?  And why does, and how could, this continue to happen? Will there ever be accountability? Or will those who have guns, wear badges, and say that they feared for their life, be given repeated immunity? To be clear, what everyone witnessed was the aftermath, and not the incident itself.  However, Reynolds gave her rendition of events immediately after the shooting    for the world to see.  And the gun that Castile made sure to tell the officer he had, was still in his pocket when he was shot.  Yanez is the only one who appears to be hyper and out of control. Reynolds is respectful and polite    despite witnessing her boyfriend dying before her. Even her    daughter is more composed than Yanez, as she reassures her mom by saying its okay, Im right here with you.  Isnt it the officer who is supposed to be trained and experienced in these encounters? Isnt it the officer who takes the oath to protect and serve? Isnt it the officer who must adhere to that oath by exercising good judgment and  ? Isnt it the officer who should be calm, steady, even tempered, composed and courteous?  What does it say when a civilian is more   and restrained than law enforcement?  Worse, what does it say when a    has to calmly sooth and reassure her mom after witnessing an officer lose his composure. Should we expect children to be more reasonable than a man with a badge and gun?  Oh, but wait, Yanez feared for his life. And lets not forget the marijuana in Castiles system that the defense made much of at trial. I guess that justified killing him, especially after he told the officer he had an gun, and was asked to produce his license. Not!  Lets be clear. No one is saying that Yanez woke up that morning in July last year looking to kill a black man.  Thats not what the jury was considering, nor is that what Im claiming here.  Instead, he was charged with acting carelessly, irresponsibly and unreasonably.  Even Stevie Wonder could see that this was the case.  The fact that Castile is dead    for no reason, and that yet another officer escapes accountability is a shame. The public expected better and deserved more from Yanez. Castile certainly did    and so did his family.  When will this madness stop?"
Rosenstein must recuse himself from involvement in Mueller probe,CNN,Paul Callan,6/17/2017,"(CNN) The Presidents latest Twitter attack on the special counsel investigation by Robert Mueller is likely to claim a new victim: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, the lawyer at least nominally in charge of the  investigation.   Rosenstein was the Justice Department official who drafted a memo to the President alleging numerous  deficiencies in the performance of   Director James Comey. The memo included stinging criticism of the FBI directors handling of the investigation of Hillary Clintons email.    Shortly thereafter, the President shocked the nation with the announcement that he had fired the controversial FBI director he had only recently praised. The White House press office immediately pointed to Rosensteins detailed memo as the justification for Comeys surprise termination. Later, that position was contradicted by the President himself, in an interview with NBCs Lester Holt, when he stated that he had made up his mind to fire Comey before he had even seen  the Rosenstein memo. In the same interview the President suggested that he was thinking about the Russia investigation at the time he terminated Comey. On the following day in an Oval Office meeting with Russian officials, the President described his FBI chief as a nut job and crazy and expressed relief that the pressure  of the Russia investigation had been lifted by the firing of Comey.  In a move that surprised and angered the President, new Attorney General Jeff Sessions, an early and ardent supporter off the Trump campaign, had recused himself from any aspect of the FBIs then ongoing investigation into the Russian alleged hacking of the presidential election and whether any Trump campaign officials colluded with the Russians in their   efforts.  Sessions quite rightly decided that he had a conflict of interest, since his role in the Trump campaign might be scrutinized as a part of the FBIs investigation. This would necessarily occur, even though Sessions had repeatedly denied improper or illegal contact with the Russians. It would be wrong for Sessions to exercise a supervisory role in any investigation that focused even in part on him. Thus, the responsibility of supervising the Russia investigation fell to the highly respected Rod Rosenstein, who had been serving as acting attorney general prior to Sessions Senate confirmation. Rosenstein then surprised the President by announcing that potential Justice Department conflicts of interest relating to the Russia Investigation required the appointment of the respected and independent Robert Mueller as a special counsel to supervise the FBIs now  rudderless investigation.   Rosenstein made it clear in public statements and in congressional testimony that the new special counsel, though tasked with the Russia investigation, could follow the evidence where it took him if related to that probe. Mueller was immediately confronted with the reality of  Trumps Lester Holt interview, his discussion with Russian officials in the White House regarding his relief that the firing of his crazy FBI Director Comey would take the pressure off the Russian probe, Comeys testimony about Trump asking for his  loyalty pledge, and what Comey perceived as the Presidents directive (the President used the word hope) to terminate the Michael Flynn investigation. In light of these facts, Democrats and many in the media across the nation called for an obstruction of justice investigation of the president.  Mueller had no choice but to add obstruction of justice to the list of potential issues his office would investigate.  All of which necessarily brings us back to Rod Rosenstein. A Trump tweet Friday morning asserted: I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Witch Hunt.  This was clearly a reference to Rosenstein, who as the current deputy attorney general is in overall charge of Muellers special counsel probe. The President, perhaps unintentionally, has focused attention on a new and serious problem with the Mueller probe. If there is an obstruction case against the President, one of the chief claims would be that Rosensteins memo was a ruse orchestrated to shift attention away from the real reason for the Comey firing: the presidents opposition to  the FBIs investigation of whether Trump campaign aides colluded with the Russians to influence the presidential election campaign.  Rosenstein will have to recuse himself from any supervisory role in the Mueller investigation due to this possible conflict of interest. He may actually be a witness in the investigation he is supposed to supervise and like Sessions will be compelled by legal ethics to assume a seat on the sidelines. A Justice Department spokesman didnt rule out that possibility Friday, saying, As the Deputy Attorney General has said numerous times, if there comes a point where he needs to recuse, he will. Like her famous predecessor as a   Justice official, the Nixon administrations Robert Bork who played a key role in the Saturday Night Massacre, the recently confirmed Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand may soon inherit a key responsibility in the Justice Department chain of command. If Rosenstein recuses himself or is fired, it could be Brands role to supervise the Mueller investigation and execute any lawful orders issued by her boss, the President of the United States. The Presidents Twitter trail suggests that firing Mr. Mueller could soon be on Ms. Brands busy agenda. Note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the chain of command within the Justice Department. The recently confirmed associate attorney general would take over if the deputy, Rod Rosenstein, is unable to serve."
Dems weigh blockade over GOP health plan,CNN,Manu Raju,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Senate Democrats are weighing whether to bring the chambers business to a halt next week in an effort to voice their objections to the GOP health care push, according to sources familiar with the effort. The Democratic leadership and    members are planning to prevent the chamber from conducting routine business, including allowing committees to meet for extended hearings when the Senate is in session. And they will demand an open process to consider health care when the Senate reconvenes Monday. Democrats might use parliamentary maneuvers to prevent committees from meeting for longer than two hours. If carried through, the hardball tactics would make it difficult for Republicans to schedule votes even on uncontroversial bills and nominees, further slowing down the already   body. One Democratic source cautioned that the caucus may not go that far given the bipartisan atmosphere following the shooting at a congressional baseball practice Wednesday. But other Democrats said they wanted to escalate the fight to give more prominence to the GOPs   process of drafting health care legislation, which Republican leaders want to pass by months end. As of yesterday, no decisions had been made about procedural tactics, but the message was that everything is on the table, a Democratic aide said. A spokesman for Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer declined to comment."
DREAMers get well-deserved reprieve from Trump,CNN,Raul A. Reyes,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Score a partial victory for immigration activists. Donald Trumps administration has announced that the   DREAMers    young people who were brought to this country illegally as children    will be allowed to stay and work here legally after all. These young people were beneficiaries of President Barack Obamas 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which celebrated its fifth anniversary this week.  Now the Department of Homeland Security has issued guidance suggesting that the DACA program will continue, and that the department will not be taking removal actions against DACA grantees.   This is welcome news for the young people directly affected by DACA. It is a tribute to their activism and advocacy that this sensible plan will continue. But Trumps decision must be seen in the context of his overall immigration enforcement strategies    because despite this development, immigrants continue to live in fear across the country. The DACA program provides temporary deportation relief and work permits for those who were brought to the US as children, have a clean record and undergo a background check. It does not grant anyone citizenship, legal status or even a green card.  It is easy to see a cynical calculation by the White House at play here.  Trump has been mired in scandal, with his domestic agenda at a near standstill.  He desperately needs something    anything    positive on the homefront.  With his approval rating at historic lows, perhaps he saw extending DACA as a way of generating some   positive news coverage, If so, Trump is running a real risk, as his base has been shown to be motivated by fear about immigration. Will they vent their anger over a betrayal by the President over the people they term illegals? And what will he do then? Still, it makes sound economic sense for the President to allow DACA to go on. DACA grantees are attending college, becoming entrepreneurs and fully integrating into society.  A 2016 study by the Center for American Progress found that DACA had a positive economic impact on its recipients    and on the overall economy.  What is unsettling is that Trumps latest position on DACA is in keeping with his mercurial personality. During his campaign, he vowed to immediately terminate the program. Later, he promised to do right by the young people affected, saying he would treat them with heart.   Meanwhile, the   status of DACA is unclear. There has been no final determination made about the DACA program, which the President has stressed needs to be handled with compassion and with heart, said Jonathan Hoffman, the assistant secretary for public affairs at the department, according to The New York Times. So Trumps decision about DACA should be viewed as good news for now.   But moves on immigration by this administration deserve to be viewed skeptically. Consider that the acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) recently said that all undocumented immigrants in the us should be uncomfortable and looking over their shoulder. Or that ICE agents have already targeted DREAMers, like Daniela Vargas and Jessica Colotl, for deportation under questionable circumstances.   Whats more, the joy in the immigrant community over this DACA news is tempered by the reality of his administrations deportation force. DACA only protects about 740, 000 young people virtually all of the other 11 million undocumented people in the US remain at risk for deportation.    In New York, immigration agents arrested a teenager right before his prom. The government is deporting Mormon moms and asylum seekers. From coast to coast, ICE officials are busy detaining otherwise   people.  Immigration arrests are up 38% this year    with the biggest jump in arrests among those who have no criminal records.   Sure, DACA grantees are pleased at this reprieve. Yet they    along with their allies    remain concerned about mothers, fathers, friends and colleagues, who might not be so lucky. Millions of   families    where some are US citizens and some undocumented    are still worried about their futures, especially because Trump is not moving forward with President Obamas Deferred Action for Parents of Americans (DAPA) program.   Although keeping DACA is a step in the right direction, this administrations destructive immigration enforcement actions continue. President Trump is still a long way from being seen as a friend to immigrants."
Cuba to Trump: US in no position to lecture,CNN,Miranda Green,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Responding to President Donald Trumps announcement Friday that he is reversing the Obama administrations steps to normalize relations with Cuba, the Castro government said the US is in no condition to lecture us. Trumps speech in Miami to announce the rollback was full of hostile rhetoric, Havanas statement said, adding that the announced policies will revert the progress achieved between the two countries in the past two years. Under the Presidents executive order, the Trump administration will begin strictly enforcing the exemptions that allow travel between the US and Cuba and prohibit commerce with Cuban businesses owned by the military and intelligence services. Trump also directed Secretary of State Rex Tillerson to convene a task force on expanding Internet access on the island and reiterated the United States opposition to efforts in the United Nations to lift the Cuban embargo until more is done to honor human rights. During his speech, Trump slammed Cuba for human rights abuses, saying, The Castro regime has shipped arms to North Korea and fueled chaos in Venezuela. While imprisoning innocents, it has harbored cop killers, hijackers and terrorists. It has supported human trafficking, forced labor and exploitation all around the globe. The Cuban government rebuked those statements in a lengthy response Friday, writing that Trumps executive order betrays a double standard on human rights. We have deep concerns by the respect and the guaranties of the human rights in that country, where there is a large number of cases of murder, brutality and police abuse, particularly against the African Americans the right to live is violated as a result of deaths by firearms, the statement read. It went on to list a litany of concerns: racial discrimination, salary inequality between genders, the marginalization of immigrants and refugees from Islamic and other countries, Trumps proposed wall on the southern border, his decision to pull out of the Paris climate accord, the imprisonment of enemy combatants at Guantanamo Bay, the killing of US and foreign citizens in drone attacks, the preface for and conduct of the wars in Iraq and other Middle Eastern countries, and estimates that the Republican health care bill would cause 23 million people to lose medical insurance. The Cuban government also called the Trumps executive order a backward step, saying the administration was resorting to coercive methods from the past in taking steps to strengthen the embargo. The US President,   once again, takes decisions that favor the political interests of an extremist minority of Cuban origin in the state of Florida, who driven by petty motivation, do not desist from their objective to punish Cuba and its people for exercising the legitimate and sovereign right to be free and for having taken the reins of their own destiny, the statement said. Trump said Friday that any easement of restrictions on doing US business in Cuba would have to wait until political prisoners are freed and fair elections are held. This is the simple truth of the Castro regime, Trump said. My administration will not hide from it, excuse it or glamorize it. And we will never, ever be blind to it. We know whats going on and we remember what happened. Applauding the Cuban dissidents in the audience, some of whom were tortured by the Castro regime, Trump pledged to expose the Cuban dictatorship for its human rights abuses."
Why we still really need to see Donald Trumps tax returns,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/17/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump released a   financial disclosure form Friday, detailing the broad outlines of his wealth but still leaving a number of unanswered questions about the specifics of not only Trumps income but also the details of his vast holdings. In short, Trumps financial disclosure is nice. His tax returns    which he became the first presidential candidate in four decades to refuse to release    would be far better. Trump voluntarily filed the disclosure forms with the Office of Government Ethics on Friday. He was not required to file the forms, which cover his earnings over the past 15 and a half months, until next spring. (Past presidents including Barack Obama and George W. Bush have also released them early, according to the Washington Post.) Trumps wealth, as documented in the report, is vast. He took in hundreds of millions of dollars in income over the past 15 months while carrying liabilities north of $300 million. (The Post estimated that Trumps assets are worth at least $1. 4 billion.) Trump raked in $288 million from his golf courses alone he made at least $37 million from    his Florida resort and a frequent weekend stomping ground for the first family. The big problem with financial disclosure forms is that they only require ranges of assets and liability    making it extremely difficult to get an accurate sense of what Trump trues wealth is. For example, consider these two paragraphs on Trumps loans from the CNN story by Cristina Alesci and Jill Disis: Overall, Trump reported liabilities of at least $311 million    mortgages and loans. But the number could be much higher because he was required only to report a range in value for each loan. Of the 16 loans he reported, five were worth more than $50 million each one is worth between $25 million and $50 million and seven were worth between $5 million and $25 million apiece. Another three loans combined were worth less than $1 million. There is also the fact that, unlike a tax return, these financial disclosure forms dont require Trump to detail how much he paid in taxes, the profits and losses from his various businesses, whether he has any holdings in foreign companies and whether (and how much) he has donated to charity. (Read this great Jeanne Sahadi piece for a comprehensive look at what tax returns tell you that financial disclosures dont.) All of which makes the rhetoric coming from Trump and his top aides regarding his level of transparency about his finances misleading. In February 2016, Trump tweeted this: Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do   someones net worth. I have already filed my financial statements   FEC. They are great!  He has repeated that line whenever he has been asked about his income tax returns since that time. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in April that the president has released plenty of information and has given more financial disclosure than anybody else, adding: I think the American population has plenty of information on his taxes. That isnt accurate. But you can bet that Trumps decision to voluntarily file his financial disclosure forms months ahead of time will become a new talking point for Trump and his aides whenever the questions regarding his taxes inevitably arise again. The key point to remember: Financial disclosures are simply no substitute for tax returns when it comes to understanding someones financial standing and various commitments. Think of it this way. You go to a baseball game. Financial disclosure forms are like sitting near the top of the upper deck. You can see a baseball game is going on but its tough to make out the individual players or figure out what pitch the pitcher is throwing. Tax returns are like having   seats behind home plate.  You can see the reaction on the batters face when he disagrees with a call. You can see how the teams interact    both with each other and amongst themselves. You can hear the pop of the fastball hitting the catchers mitt. Its an entirely different game and experience. Right now, the American public is sitting way up in the rafters of Trump Financial Stadium. You have a vague sense of whats going on.

Early vote tally foretells soaring turnout in most expensive House race ever,CNN,Eric Bradner,6/17/2017,"(CNN) More than 140, 000 voters had cast their ballots by the time early voting in Georgia closed Friday    another indication of   turnout in the closely watched runoff for a House seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.  And thats leaving neither side confident of victory in what is likely to be a tight race for Georgias 6th Congressional District seat. The pool of early voters includes more than 36, 000 who did not participate in the April primary contest for the seat, which was vacated when former Rep. Tom Price became President Donald Trumps health and human services secretary, according to the Georgia secretary of states office.  The early vote total soared past the 57, 000 who voted early in the primary, where Ossoff reached 48% just shy of the majority that would have avoided the runoff entirely. Ultimately, more than 192, 000 people voted in the primary    close to the 210, 000 who participated in the 2014 midterm election in the district.  The early voting in the runoff left neither party feeling comfortable and has aides on both sides forecasting a close contest Tuesday    even as Republicans celebrated turnout that is approaching presidential election levels in the   district.  The high turnout reflects the intense local and national interest a contest that    with more than $50 million spent between the candidates, their parties and super PACs    has become the most expensive House race ever.  Progressives who have pumped more than $23 million into Ossoffs campaign have long viewed the race as their best chance to use a special election to deliver a political blow to Trump    and to send a message to House Republicans that aiding Trump will come at a price by capturing what for decades has been a reliably Republican seat.  Operatives in both parties acknowledge that more Republicans have voted early than Democrats    overall, a reason for Handels campaign to be optimistic and Ossoffs campaign to sweat.  That reality, though, is no surprise in the district, which encompasses much of Atlantas northern suburbs. After all, Mitt Romney carried the district by 24 percentage points in 2012    and Price never faced a serious challenge for his seat.  It was the 2016 presidential results that gave Democrats reason for optimism. Trump only bested Hillary Clinton by 1. 5 percentage points    a result that fed into Democrats belief that while Trump had made gains in predominantly white rural and exurban areas, the more highly educated, wealthy, diverse suburbs held more   voters and presented the party with an opportunity to make gains.  Handel and the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund have worked hard to turn the race away from Trumps leadership in Washington and make it about Ossoffs youth (he is 30) and about the House Democratic leader, Nancy Pelosi. In particular, Republicans have hammered Ossoff on national security issues.  Ossoff, meanwhile, has sought to run a centrist campaign    studiously avoiding even saying Trumps name in an effort to make himself an acceptable alternative for typically conservative voters who might be inclined to buck the GOP.  The 36, 000 early voters who didnt participate in the primary at all are among the major question marks that make the early vote data hard to read for partisan advantages.  In analyzing that group, Tom Bonier, the CEO of the Democratic voter targeting firm TargetSmart, pointed out that they are less likely to be white than all other segments of voters    and 25% of them are under the age of 35. That demographic analysis figures to benefit Ossoff.  Because of the districts status as suburban, educated and diverse, the Georgia race could be a harbinger of Democrats ability to compete for similar   seats in places like Orange County, California, the Philadelphia suburbs and New York state in 2018.  But the district is also more conservative than some of the   targets. According to the Cook Political Reports Partisan Voter Index, there are 71   House seats that are actually less   than Georgias 6th Congressional District."
Scalises condition upgraded to serious,CNN,Jennifer Hansler,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalises condition has been upgraded to serious after he underwent surgery Saturday for injuries sustained in a shooting at a Republican congressional baseball practice earlier this week, the hospital treating him said in a release. Scalise, the   GOP leader in the House, continues to show signs of improvement, MedStar Washington Hospital Center said in a statement released on behalf of his family. He is more responsive, and is speaking with his loved ones. The Scalise family greatly appreciates the outpouring of thoughts and prayers. Scalise, Tyson Foods lobbyist Matt Mika, congressional aide Zach Barth and US Capitol Police officer Crystal Griner were shot during an attack on the Republican congressional baseball team as it practiced Wednesday morning. Capitol Police officer David Bailey and Texas Rep. Roger Williams were also injured during the incident. The gunman, identified by law enforcement officials as    James Hodgkinson of Belleville, Illinois, later died from injuries sustained during a shootout with police on the scene. Although Scalise was able to talk while lying injured on the ball field, he had gone into shock by the time he was transported by helicopter to the hospital and arrived in critical condition with an imminent risk of death, Sava said. He added that Scalise would be in the hospital for some time and would need a period of healing and rehabilitation after being discharged. Mika also remained hospitalized Saturday after undergoing an additional surgery. His family said in a statement he was showing positive results and was expected to make a full recovery. Griner remained in the hospital in good condition after sustaining a gunshot wound to the ankle, according to a Friday update. Bailey, Barth, and Williams have been treated and released."
Meet the former ultra-Orthodox rabbi now living as a woman,CNN,Alexandra King,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Just five years ago,    Abby Stein was an   rabbi named Yisrael. Today, shes an openly transgender woman. And shes ready to share her extraordinary story with the world. Stein was born in Brooklyn and brought up in a Hasidic Jewish community, a conservative Jewish sect that shuns the modern world. The sixth child and first son in a family of 13 kids, Abby, like all the males in her community, wore the dark clothes and distinctive fur hat of her religious sect, and spoke only Yiddish.  She dutifully followed the traditional path of a young Hasidic male in her strictly gender segregated community, attending a Yeshiva in upstate New York, and becoming a rabbi. At 17, as is customary in the Hasidic community, a marriage was arranged and she became engaged. At 18, she got married. A year later, Abbys wife had a baby. Though overjoyed to be a parent, Abby says the birth of her child, a son, was a catalyst to confront a secret shed harbored her entire life. For as long as she could remember, she suspected she was female. It felt like my gender was punching me in the face. Everyone had told me that I was a boy, but it didnt feel right, she said, in an interview with CNN. As a child, I remember saying, Im a girl, right? but no, everyone said something else. It was a hard experience growing up and not having any outlet. Not having any way to express myself, she recalls. Abby had no idea that transgender people even existed. When I was around 12 I decided that I know what I feel gender wise, but thats impossible, because I am the only that feels like that. LGBT people of any form just dont exist in that community, she says. Growing up in Hasidic Brooklyn, she says, was like living in a bubble. Movies, TV, music, magazines, literature, it doesnt exist there. Theres no access to the internet. They dont speak English. Men and women dont interact with each other at all. As far as I know, its the most gender segregated society in the United States, Stein said. I personally grew up in New York City, but I also didnt. I grew up geographically here, but culturally it was a pretend   Eastern Europe, she adds.   A breakthrough came when Stein, at the age of 20, was able to use a friends tablet to connect to a   network. It was the first time she had ever been on the internet, and what she found there changed her life. Writing in Hebrew, a language she could understand, she tentatively typed a boy turning into a girl into Google.  That led to a Wikipedia page about transgender people, and then an anonymous online Israeli forum for the transgender community, where she began to interact with other users who were also struggling with their gender identity. It was a light bulb moment. The avatar name she chose to use for those first anonymous forays in the online chat room? Chava, the Hebrew translation of Eve.  The first woman! Stein says with a laugh. With her worldview forever altered by understanding that she wasnt alone, the more Stein learned, the more she felt compelled to leave the cloistered community she had been raised in, and whose religious practices she had long begun to question. But she knew it would come at a tremendous cost. It was a slow process. It doesnt happen overnight, she says.  To some extent, leaving the community was even harder than transitioning. I had no idea what I was getting into. I didnt know anyone, couldnt speak the language, and didnt have an education. I didnt know how to dress. I didnt know how to talk. I remember the first time walking into a Starbucks, I was like, OK, whats happening here?  The culture shock is just in every level, every way. . .. Its like being an immigrant in your own country. In the summer of 2013, Stein and her wife separated. With the help of YouTube videos and the New   Footsteps organization, which provides support for people leaving   communities, Stein learned English, gained her high school diploma and applied to college.  On a whim, after being encouraged by a friend, she decided to apply to Columbia University. She was stunned when she was accepted.  I got a phone call and I think I froze for five minutes. I was totally not expecting it, she said. At school she began hormone treatments. And, on November 11, 2015, Yisrael officially became Abby, coming out in a post on her blog. Her name, she says, was something she chose for very deliberate reasons. Abby comes from Abigail, who in the Bible is one of King Davids wives. Shes a very strong character in the Bible, and in the Talmud they say that she says that she was one of the seven most beautiful women to have ever lived in the world. It also means the source of joy or source of happiness. So there was a lot that resonated with me, Stein says. Today, Stein, who has delicate features, a dry sense of humor and a   Yiddish accent, says shes finally the woman she always knew she was. However, coming out has come at a cost. Her parents have not spoken to her since she told them she was transitioning. She still sees her son, and some of her siblings.  But Stein has found solace in the transgender community, and is determined to help other people like her. Shes in a loving relationship, is writing a memoir and is in the final stages of putting together a support group for trans individuals who have grown up in fundamentalist religious environments. Already, she says, many people have been in touch. I interacted last week with someone who grew up Amish, people who grew up Mormon, people who grow up fundamentalist Muslim in the Middle East, Jehovas witnesses, Stein said. Were talking here not just about people or communities that have   sentiment, but communities where this is seen as evil or something that is rarely discussed, she said. Her fundamental message to them, Stein emphasizes, is sincere and simple. Its hard, but its possible, she said."
Hollywood reacts to Bill Cosby mistrial,CNN,Lisa Respers France,6/17/2017,"(CNN) Celebrities took to social media Saturday to comment on the mistrial of Bill Cosby for sexual assault. Girls star Lena Dunham was one of the most outspoken. Bill Cosbys trial is about much more than Bill Cosby. When women see justice served, their own fear  trauma are eased, she tweeted.  When they dont, survivors of sexual assault have to watch every day as the legal system calls them liars and denies their truth, Dunham went on to say. Its an unimaginable grind. My heart is with every survivor reliving the erasure of their own experience today. A judge declared a mistrial after a jury was deadlocked in Cosbys trial for the alleged 2004 rape of Andrea Constand.  Constand was one of dozens of women who accused Cosby of sexual assault over a   time period, but hers has been the only one to result in a criminal trial. Dunhams colleague, Girls director and filmmaker Richard Shepard, tweeted a photo of the New York Magazine cover featuring several of Cosbys accusers.   Judd Apatow has been a frequent critic of Cosby since the allegations surfaced. He wrote on Twitter: If Cosbys defense is true he is admitting to cheating hundreds of times on his wife with the use of quaaludes. Thats what he admits.  Make it or Break It creator Holly Sorensen quipped, Unfortunately convictions arent like Oscars. you cant give one to Cosby for his body of work. Comedian D. L. Hughley tweeted: A jury deliberated longer in the #Cosby Case! Than the murder of #PhilandoCastile! Musical artist and producer Dready tweeted Guilty or not, this trial will be a dark cloud over Bill Cosbys whole career forever. As talk turned to a possible retrial for Cosby, Silicon Valley star Kumail Nanjiani asked if it were possible to find a jury not biased because of his fame. Serious question: How will Cosby ever get an unbiased jury, Nanjiani wrote on Twitter. Who doesnt know him or have some sort of association with him?"
"Even As Stocks Push Higher, Clouds Gather For The U.S. Economy - Breitbart",Breitbart,John Carney,6/16/2017,"While President Donald Trump has said that he expects some very good numbers on economic growth shortly and stocks hit new highs, economic data suggests the economy is growing by less than expected. [The New York and Atlanta Federal Reserve banks both lowered their estimates of Gross Domestic Product Friday. The Atlanta Feds GDPNow model forecasts seasonally adjusted real GDP growth is 2. 9 percent, down from its prior forecast of 3. 2 percent. The New York Feds Nowcast fell to 1. 9 percent, from 2. 25 percent a week ago.  The distance between the forecast indicates that forecasting economic growth is far from an exact science. For that matter, even calculating actual economic growth is not an exact science, as demonstrated by the fact that GDP numbers are frequently revised in the months that follow their initial release. The staffs of the Fed banks create the projections using economic models that can produce different results even when looking at the same data. But both the Atlanta and New York forecasts show a discernible trend toward slowing growth. Earlier in the quarter, the Atlanta Fed was producing growth forecasts above 3. 5 percent and even above 4. 0 percent. Forecasted growth declined steeply in late May and has not recovered as new data has come in. The June 16 forecast was the first to come in below 3. 0 percent for the second quarter. The New York Feds   forecast also started out near or above 3. 0 percent and has been mostly falling since then. It hit 1. 8 percent in early May, bounced back a little, but is now once again near its low. The most recent decline was driven by disappointing data on housing starts and export prices, indicating that residential investment and net exports will have a smaller contribution to GDP growth than earlier data suggested. Friday morning, U. S. consumer sentiment also unexpectedly declined. Bloombergs U. S. Economic Surprise, which measures whether incoming economic data beat or miss expectations, fell below zero for the first time this year. It is now at it lowest point since Trump was elected in November. This suggests the economy is losing momentum."
House Witness on Libya: Moscows Foothold in Libya Is Growing,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/16/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     Moscows foothold in   Libya is growing as Russian President Vladimir Putin increasingly supports former Gen. Khalifa Haftar, the leader of the opposition to the United   Government of National Accord (GNA) an expert on Russian foreign policy tells a House panel. [In March, Gen. Thomas Waldhauser, the head of U. S. Africa Command (AFRICOM) told the Senate Armed Services that Russias intervention in Libya, including Putins support for Gen. Haftar, dubbed the new Muammar Gaddafi, is very concerning for the American military.  Although Russia has hosted both Gen. Haftar and Libyan Prime Minister Fayez   who serves as the chief of the GNA, Putin favors the opposition leader. During a hearing on Russias objectives in the Muslim world held Thursday by the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and North Africa, Anna Borshchevskaya, an expert on Russian foreign policy at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, told lawmakers: Moscows foothold in Libya is growing. This issue is important to watch in the months ahead. Putin increasingly supports Libyas Gen. Khalifa Haftar, who controls the   eastern part of the country but wants more. With the fall of Muammar [Gaddafi] in October 2011, Russia lost not only several billion dollars worth of investments but also access to the Benghazi port. U. S.  militias overthrew and executed Libyan dictator Gaddafi (also spelled Qadhafi) in 2011. Borshchevskaya noted: Haftar (who served under Qadhafi) pursues an   agenda and looks to Putin to help secure his leadership in Libya at the expense of the   civilian government. Haftar is a deeply polarizing figure, one that by expert accounts is the wrong choice for the country. Echoing other assessments, American Gen. Waldhauser indicated that Gen. Haftar represents an opportunity for Russia to fill the vacuum left by former President Barack Obamas administration. Russia provides the Tobruk government [led by Haftar] with military advice and diplomatic support at the UN, the Russian foreign policy expert told the House panel. In May 2016, Moscow reportedly printed nearly 4 billion Libyan dinars (approximately $2. 8 billion) for Libyas Central Bank and transferred the money to a branch loyal to Haftar.  Borshchevskaya continued: In the context of growing tensions with Tripoli, Haftar made two trips to Moscow in the second half of 2016, and in January of this year, he toured the Russian aircraft carrier Admiral Kuznetsov as it returned home from Syrian waters. While aboard the Kuznetsov, Haftar held a video call with Russian defense minister Sergei Shoigu and reportedly talked about fighting terrorism in the Middle East. This February, Moscow flew approximately seventy of Haftars wounded soldiers to Russia for treatment. Moscow has denied allegations that it considers establishing military bases in Libya with Haftars support, Borshchevskaya pointed out. Russia is trying to exert influence on the ultimate decision of who becomes, and what entity becomes, in charge of the government inside Libya, the AFRICOM chief told Senators in March. Theyre working to influence that decision.  Russias objectives in the Middle East and North Africa are to support other dictators as well as undermine U. S. influence and democratic efforts, the experts told the House members Thursday. Putins objectives in the Middle East have been consistent both with his domestic behavior and with his approach to other parts of the world: support fellow dictators and undermine efforts at democratization   what his Foreign Police Concept refers to as ideological values        imposed from outside, Mr. Vladimir   the vice chairman of the   organization Open Russia, told lawmakers Thursday."
Trump family makes first visit to Camp David,CNN,Kate Bennett,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) Think Trump orbit in a recreational sense, and its likely golf or gilded interiors come to mind    a vision of   playgrounds replete with ribeye steaks and crystal chandeliers. Rustic? Not so much. But this weekend, President Donald Trump, first lady Melania Trump and presumably    Barron are testing the woodsy digs at Camp David, the rural presidential getaway deep in the mountains of Maryland. It will be the Presidents first trip to Camp David, and his first weekend overnight trip away from the White House not at a   property. Its an unusual decision for the President, who is widely known as someone who doesnt like to disrupt his daily routine or spend weekends anywhere except at   properties.  More to the point on this weekends overnighter, the President appears to have a predisposed opinion of Camp David, which he shared with a European journalist shortly before he was sworn in.  Camp David is very rustic. Its nice, youd like it, he quipped. You know how long youd like it? For about 30 minutes. But others speak of the presidential retreat more kindly. Its a place they can let their hair down and relax, says Marti Mongiello, who in the 1990s worked as a chef and manager at Camp David, which is located near the tiny town of Thurmont, Maryland. There arent people waiting to take pictures. If they want to walk and feel alone in the woods, they can do that. Mongiello, a colorful figure who now runs a small North Carolina inn which is also home to the Presidential Culinary Museum, served the Clintons during his tenure. He says he is familiar with Trumps eating habits as well, having consulted on a handful of Trump property restaurants.  If and when they are at Camp David, the place will be stocked with his favorites, those Keebler Vienna Fingers cookies, and better have the Lays potato chips, he said, adding that the Secret Service will also have probably checked out the nearest Kentucky Fried Chicken locations, just in case POTUS gets a craving. You have to figure that out. Theyll map, know, target and analyze how to get in and get out of at least three locations, he said, adding that staff got used to fast food runs during Bill Clintons visits.  (For the record, theres a KFC in Thurmont thats open until midnight on Saturdays, and one just over the border in Waynesboro, Pennsylvania, about a   drive from Camp David.) Outside of easy access to fried chicken, Trump could also get to know Camp David for its security purposes its a fully activated government safe zone, just a   Marine One helicopter ride from the South Lawn of the White House. Theres a great element of secrecy, Thurmont Mayor John Kinnaird told CNN in March. But, I like to say, it doesnt really affect the residents. The President comes and goes and we dont ever really know about it.  Trump, a lover of pomp and circumstance who craves the roar of a crowd, probably wont like that part much either. And then theres the mice. Youre in the woods, on top of a mountain, so if you see a mouse in the house, dont lose your mind, Mongiello said, recounting one such episode with first lady Hillary Clinton screaming after seeing a rodent. The Secret Service came running, he said. However, most first ladies enjoy accompanying their husbands to Camp David, which has approximately 16 cabins that serve as   houses, complete with   amenities and plenty of staff to assist VIP needs. Theres skeet shooting, basketball, tennis, horseback riding, rock climbing, a movie theater, bowling, even laser tag    not to mention so many hiking trails that its easy to get lost.  Rosalynn Carter tells a great story about walking, seemingly alone, in the woods there with her mother, and her mom being alarmed by the sound of leaves crunching behind them, said Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of First Women: The Grace and Power of Americas Modern First Ladies. It was Rosalynns Secret Service agent trailing them. So even though its more private, the first family still isnt ever completely alone.  George W. Bush spent every Christmas as president with his family at Camp David.  [It] was like a sanctuary for the Bushes and for a lot of other presidents, Anita McBride, first lady Laura Bushs former chief of staff, told CNN. George W. and Laura Bush I think had an exceptional relationship with Camp David because they had spent so much time there. It gave President Bush an opportunity to relax, to have the outdoors at his feet, to get on his bike, to ride around, to just have that freedom of movement that you really dont have when youre living in the White House. Hiking, hoops, horses    not exactly the hobbies of Donald J. Trump. However, there is golf. President Dwight D. Eisenhower had a   course with multiple tees built outside the Aspen cabin, where most presidents stay. If that doesnt do the trick, Trump can tee off at the Camp David driving range, adjacent to the helicopter pad.  Still, if activities and relaxation arent his thing, Trump might want to consider Camp David for work purposes many presidents have entertained foreign leaders there.  He may not be the kind of person that likes a rustic atmosphere, and thats what youll find at Camp David, says Kinnaird. At some point, youll find President Trump at Camp David for whatever reason, whether its a family getaway, whether its a sensitive meeting that they want to have close to Washington, and its a nice place to visit. I think hell be up here.  This weekend could be the deciding factor. Or it could send Trump back to the gilded confines of a Trump property."
Longtime Trump attorney hires lawyer in Russia probe,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trumps longtime attorney and adviser Michael Cohen has hired a lawyer to represent him in the investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, Cohen told CNN on Friday. Cohen, who serves as Trumps personal attorney, hired Stephen Ryan, a partner at the   law firm McDermott, Will and Emery, to handle inquiries related to the investigations into Russian meddling in the election. News of the hire comes two weeks after Cohen was subpoenaed by the House intelligence committee as part of the committees probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Cohen told CNN earlier this week that he is committed to complying with the subpoena. He has also agreed to testify before the committee September 5. He declined to say whether he is fielding additional investigative inquiries, directing all questions on the matter to his attorney. Ryan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Cohen served as executive vice president and special counsel at the Trump Organization during Trumps presidential campaign and did not hold a formal title in the campaign. But he was a prominent TV surrogate for Trump during the campaign and led the National Diversity Coalition in support of it. Cohen has repeatedly pushed back on allegations that he was involved in any coordination with Russian officials during the 2016 campaign. Ryan, Cohens   attorney, is the head of government strategies at McDermott, Will and Emery. Cohen is just the latest Trump adviser to hire an attorney in connection with the widening probe into Russian election meddling and allegations of collusion between Trump campaign associates and Russia. Vice President Mike Pence has also retained a lawyer to respond to inquiries related to the investigations, which include an inquiry led by special counsel Robert Mueller and investigations by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Former Trump campaign aide Michael Caputo has also hired Dennis Vacco, a former New York attorney general and US attorney, to represent him in the matters, a source familiar with the situation said. The source said the FBI has contacted Caputo in connection with its investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election."
Trump adds lawyer John Dowd to Russia legal team,CNN,Miranda Green,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump has hired     attorney John Dowd as part of his legal team, a source familiar with the hiring tells CNN.  Dowd previously led the investigation into former Cincinnati Reds player and manager Pete Rose over gambling charges for Major League Baseball and authored the report that led to the banning of Rose from the MLB.  Dowd additionally represented Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona during the Keating Five Senate ethics investigation in 1990. McCain was one of five senators accused of corruption, but he was cleared of having acted improperly. Trump is being investigated by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller for potential obstruction of justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey, The Washington Post reported Wednesday evening. Mueller is interviewing three top intelligence officials as early as this week as part of the probe, the Post reported, citing five people briefed on the requests. It is the most significant sign yet that Muellers investigation is extending beyond questions of Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump called the report phony in a Thursday morning tweet. However, another tweet from Trump on Friday appeared to confirm the investigation    blaming the deputy attorney general for what he is labeling a witch hunt against him. I am being investigated for firing the FBI Director by the man who told me to fire the FBI Director! Trump said on Twitter."
Ryan and Pelosi back Team Scalise,CNN,Eli Watkins,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi projected a message of unity Thursday evening at the outset of the congressional baseball game. The joint interview, a first for the two, with CNNs Jake Tapper on Erin Burnett OutFront, came a day after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and others were shot at a Republican baseball practice. Hes got a ways to go, Ryan said of Scalise. Hes going to recover. Its going to take him some time. Pelosi, who like Ryan was wearing Louisiana gear in honor of Scalise, said the injured member was a lovely person, and hailed the bipartisan spirit of the annual game. Tonight were all Team Scalise, Pelosi said. Asked if the political climate and incidents like Wednesdays shooting indicated an increased threat to lawmakers, Ryan said it was incumbent on politicians to cool things down across the nation. Ryan said, What were trying to do is tone down the rhetoric, lead by example and show people we can disagree with one another, we can have different ideas without being vitriolic, without going to such extremes. He added that members of Congress had to meet with the public and needed to strike a balance between openness and security. Pelosi noted that in the 2011 shooting of Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, several of her constituents were also shot    including a    girl who died.  When we evaluate the needs of our members its about protecting the members and their constituents as well, Pelosi said. Both stressed repeatedly the need for politicians to step away from inflammatory remarks. As for the prospect of passing legislation on a bipartisan basis that could prevent gun violence incidents like Wednesdays shooting, Ryan pointed to existing mental health legislation. Weve made some pretty good progress on that, Ryan said. We now have to execute and implement that progress. Pelosi said there is desire among Democrats for a task force on gun safety to study the issue. But thats not for today, Pelosi said. Today is about coming together and celebrating the greatness of Steve Scalise. Ryan and Pelosi have sought to present a unified front since the shooting. Shortly after the incident, the pair addressed a packed House chamber, calling for unity and condemning the attack. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer echoed Pelosi and Ryans calls for unity. We want everybody to know that weve always had a robust discussion of the issues in this country throughout our history, McConnell told CNNs Anderson Cooper on Thursday in a joint interview with Schumer. But we dont dislike each other.  We work together all the time. . .. We have our political arguments but at the end of the day, we are all Americans. And I think everybody needs to remember that because were all in this thing together. Schumer said he hopes the tragedy can bring the parties even closer together. We work together pretty closely before this tragedy, he said. But if it can help bring things closer together and help us all work closer together, its a horrible way to do it.  We all pray for Mr. Scalise and all the other peoples speedy recovery, but lets hope we can get some good at this tragedy.  Both agreed that arguments between Republicans and Democrats often make the news, but cooperation between the two parties doesnt. If we can still, despite the rhetoric, work together in areas where we can work together and the Senate as the cooling saucer help and bring people together a little bit, thats a very good thing and I know Mitch does because weve talked about it, and I do    we aim to do it, Schumer said. But as several voices supportive of President Donald Trump, like former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, drew lines between   rhetoric and the shooting, Pelosi pushed back earlier Thursday, arguing the Republican insistence that Democratic rhetoric was to blame for the shooting rang hollow, given the long record of vitriolic language from the Republican side of the aisle. The alleged gunman expressed intense opposition to Republicans on social media and identified himself as a supporter of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders took to the Senate floor on Wednesday to say the gunman had apparently volunteered for his campaign. He said the shooting sickened him and stressed his commitment to nonviolent action. In the Thursday interview, Ryan said he wanted to find more opportunities for Republicans and Democrats to break bread together. There are not enough   exercises, Ryan said."
"Hospital: Scalise critical, improved in last 24 hours",CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) As his colleagues played baseball in his honor Thursday evening, MedStar Washington Hospital Center medical gave an update on Rep. Steve Scalise, who remains in critical condition but has improved. Scalise, the third ranking member of House Republican leadership, was among six people who were injured after a gunman opened fire Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, during a Republicans   practice ahead of a charity baseball game.  The gunman, identified by officials as James Hodgkinson, died after the shootout. Earlier today, Congressman Steve Scalise underwent a second surgery related to his internal injuries and a broken bone in his leg, MedStar said in a statement Thursday. He remains in critical condition, but has improved in the last 24 hours. The congressman will require additional operations, and will be in the hospital for some time. The Congressional Baseball Game, an annual tradition, went on as planned Thursday. Though the game pegs Republicans against Democrats, attendees and participating lawmakers showed unity in wake of the shooting. More than $1 million has been raised for Congressional Sports for Charity so far, the games organizers announced. Instead of wearing hats representing their home teams, as is the normal tradition, this year players on both teams wore Louisiana State University hats in honor of Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, for part of the game. House Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi told CNNs Jake Tapper on Erin Burnett OutFront that despite party affiliation they were both on Team Scalise on Thursday. President Donald Trump, who visited Scalise in the hospital on Wednesday, sent a video message that played at the start of the game. By playing tonight, you are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence, or assaults on our democracy, Trump said. The game will go on."
List of Republican congressmen found with baseball practice shooter,CNN,Dana Bash,6/16/2017,"Washington (CNN) A list of names    including some Republican members of Congress    was found with the Alexandria shooter, according to a law enforcement source and Rep.

"Trump delegates troop decisions, to praise and concern",CNN,Nicole Gaouette,6/16/2017,"Washington  (CNN) President Donald Trumps decision to delegate authority over troop levels in Afghanistan has been lauded by those who feel hes correcting Obama administration overreach, even as it raises concerns that he may be ceding too much civilian control of the military. Defense Secretary James Mattis announced Thursday that Trump had given him authority over Afghanistan troop levels, a little more than a month after the President had given him control over the number of US soldiers operating in Syria and Iraq. Mattis is expected to send some 3, 000 to 5, 000 additional troops to Afghanistan.  Former defense officials say civilian oversight of the military is not just an important check in a healthy democracy, it ensures that larger strategic considerations are taken into account    while others question whether the Trump administration has a broader strategy at all. Former officials also stressed that even if a president delegates some decisions, theres no avoiding the fact that ultimate responsibility rests with the   .  I think its important that he give troop number responsibility to Secretary Mattis, but not the decision, because to put more troops in after a long period of decreasing is a policy change for America, retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal, a commander of US troops and International Security Assistance Forces in Afghanistan, told CNN.  It is deciding were going to push the clock further, we are going to stay involved longer, we are going to engage the American people and the Afghan people. Thats a presidential level decision that he has to own, McChrystal said of Trump.   Mattis told lawmakers Thursday that the President had delegated him the authority to turn the numbers up and down as necessary after months of discussion. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, said he wanted to congratulate the President for having the vision and, quite frankly, good judgment to allow Secretary Mattis in consultation with a very good military leadership team to set the troop levels.   What a novel idea for the    to turn to his commanders and say, what you need to win?  Graham said. What do you need to win? Troop specifications date back to at least the Vietnam War, according to the Government Accountability Office. They have historically served as a political marker to define the scale of US military involvement in places like Iraq, but military officials see the numbers as arbitrary, a straitjacket that forces commanders to artificially split units and use contractors to meet the caps.  Trumps move to loosen the reins on military commanders in Afghanistan follows a similar decision about the generals decision making authority in Syria and Iraq. In late April, Trump delegated authority to Mattis to set troop levels in the fight against ISIS, a move a senior US defense official said enables military commanders to become more agile, adaptive and efficient in supporting our partners. Troop levels in Syria are officially now around 500, though officials tell CNN the number on the ground is closer to 1, 000. Officials have explained that discrepancy by saying the difference is due to temporary forces not being counted as part of the official total. The same is true in Iraq, where the official number of US troops is a little over 5, 000, though officials have told CNN in the past that levels are actually closer to 7, 000.  In Afghanistan, there are now about 8, 400 US troops taking part in Operation Resolute Support, which involves both counter terrorism operations against ISIS and the Taliban as well as the mission to train, advise and assist Afghan forces.  Some, like Stephen Miles, the director of Win Without War, a group focused on promoting a more progressive national security policy, have said they worry this is an attempt by Trump to wash his hands of responsibility for these wars.   President Trump has delegated this decision to Secretary of Defense James Mattis in a seeming effort to absolve responsibility for sending US troops into harms way, Miles said. But make no mistake, President Trump is    and he will be held accountable for once again escalating this endless war in Afghanistan. Miles is among those who question the wisdom of sending more troops into a war that US officials acknowledge isnt looking good    and has been going on for 16 years now.  Not winning, Even Mattis himself has acknowledged that the US is not winning the war against the Taliban, and the administration has not provided any explanation on how sending a few thousand more troops will reverse that course, Miles said.  He noted that Afghanistans problems    longstanding tribal and regional feuds, poverty, rampant corruption    remain unsolved after 16 years of war and considerable American blood and treasure, and likely cant be resolved with a military response. That sort of larger strategic vision and a larger strategy is important, said Michael Eisenstadt, a former US military analyst and now director of the Military and Security Studies program at the Washington Institute.  Eisenstadt sees no problems with giving Mattis authority over troop levels. Civilian oversight is provided by the civilian service secretaries and the civilian SECDef, he said, using the shorthand for defense secretary. That hasnt changed. But Eisenstadt sees potential problems in the administrations lack of a clear strategic vision. Indeed, Mattis told lawmakers that there isnt a set strategy yet    that he and other Cabinet officials are working on one and we will present that to the president, probably within the next several weeks.  Eisenstadt said that could pose problems if local military commanders are given greater latitude to act, as seems to be the case, and the policy framework and goals they are supposed to be acting within and advancing, respectively, are not clear, he added.  Thats likely to be the case as policy reviews on a number of issues are currently underway, Eisenstadt said, even as the ground regarding some of these issues is shifting under our feet as we speak. That could be a problem. Formula for a foreign policy mess, Add to that the fact that the President may be distracted by his domestic problems    you may possibly have a formula for a foreign policy mess, Eisenstadt said.  Others flag that no matter how capable Trumps generals are, he cant expect them to advise him on the political and policy implications of military decisions.  Derek Chollet, a former defense official in the Obama administration, noted that military decisions have costs, and that civilian leadership has the responsibility for assessing them. That means maintaining a broader view that takes in more than just the military aspects of a campaign, an assessment that is crucial to US national interests.  If we decide to dramatically escalate our role in Afghanistan, well, thats got to come from somewhere. Someone has to pay for that and we have to absorb that risk somewhere, Chollet said.  And if the civilian leadership isnt engaged, the danger is that the military doesnt have the perspective of the entire country in mind, Chollet said. If we end up escalating conflicts at the expense of other priorities in the federal budget, in our foreign policy, thats a problem."
DUP Set to Spurn Tory Remainers and Back Full Brexit,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,6/16/2017,"Ulsters Democratic Unionist Party, which is expected to prop up Theresa Mays minority government over the coming months, has spurned Tory Remainers who hoped they would force the Prime Minister to ask the EU for a   Soft Brexit. [According to ITVs Robert Peston, a source within the DUP was very keen to be quoted as saying that his party completely backs [Mays] vision of Brexit     and not that of her Chancellor of the Exchequer, Philip Hammond.  While both May and Hammond campaigned for a Remain vote during the EU referendum, the Prime Minister has subsequently endorsed what supporters call a Clean Brexit taking Britain out of the blocs Single Market and its associated Free Movement regime, as well as the Customs Union which precludes   from conducting an independent trade policy. Remain diehards, who want a Soft Brexit in which Britain would remain party to the Single Market and Customs Union in order to maintain the closest possible links to the European Union, term this a Hard or Extreme Brexit. Hammonds team at HM Treasury     the engine room of the Remain campaigns Project Fear under his predecessor George Osborne     are said to have entered   mode as he canvasses support for such a deal. DUP backs Theresa Mays vision of Brexit, not Philip Hammonds     ITV News https:  .      Robert Peston (@Peston) June 15, 2017,  If Pestons source is reliable, however, it seems the Soft Brexit faction have lost crucial leverage. It had been claimed that the DUP, which is keen to see a minimum of economic friction between Ulster and the Irish Republic after Brexit, would at least back their calls for Britain to stay in the Customs Union. The ITV presenter has been led to believe that the DUP is 100 per cent committed to the UK leaving the Single Market AND the Customs Union     having preferred to use its bargaining power to press for plans to introduce   for the winter fuel allowance and scrap the pensions triple lock to be dropped. Leavers within the Government are predicting ferocious resistance to Brexit from without the Cabinet as well as within, with one minister predicting  utterly bitter, trench warfare as opposition politicians and Tory rebels fight us line by line, in committees, on the floor and in the Lords, for months and months on end."
US sailors missing after collision off Japan,CNN,Brad Lendon,6/16/2017,"Tokyo (CNN) Seven US sailors are missing and the commanding officer of a US destroyer is among the injured after the warship and a merchant ship collided off the coast of Japan, the US Navy said. The smaller   destroyer USS Fitzgerald suffered severe damage to its starboard side. The collision affected Fitzgeralds forward starboard side above and below the water line, causing significant damage and associated flooding to two berthing spaces, a machinery space, and the radio room, according to a statement from US 7th Fleet. The statement hinted that the missing sailors could be trapped in the damaged area of the destroyer. It remains uncertain how long it will take to gain access to the spaces once the ship is pier side . .. to methodically continue the search for the missing, the statement said. The two ships collided around 1:30 a. m. local time Saturday in the Pacific Ocean, about 56 nautical miles southwest from the port of Yokosuka and 12 miles off the Izu Peninsula, the Japanese coast guard said. The Fitzgerald had left the US naval base in Yokosuka, where it is based, earlier Friday for routine operations in the area, a US Naval Forces Japan spokesman said.  The warship was towed back to Yokosuka, escorted by a Japanese coast guard ship, naval officials said. It arrived at port late Saturday, when divers began inspecting the damage. Earlier, the ships commander, Cmdr. Bryce Benson, was evacuated by a Japanese naval helicopter while US military copters evacuated two injured US sailors. All three are in stable condition at the US Naval Hospital in Yokosuka, said Cmdr. Ron Flanders, public affairs officer for US Naval Forces Japan. Five Japanese Maritime Self Defense force ships were leading the search for the missing US sailors at the site of the collision, joined by another US warship, the   destroyer USS Dewey, the 7th Fleet said. US and Japanese aircraft also were involved. No one hurt on merchant ship, The merchant vessel involved is the ACX Crystal, a container ship flagged in the Philippines, officials said. It is chartered by Japanese shipping company Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha (NYK) and owned by   Corporation, NYK said. No one aboard the Crystal was hurt, and no oil spilled from the vessel, NYK said.  NYK and the ships owner are cooperating a Japan Coast Guard investigation into the collision, the shipping firm said.  Our thoughts and deep concerns go out to all those directly affected, NYK said. The   website marinetraffic. com shows the ship had left the Japanese port of Nagoya on Friday evening. It was expected to dock at a Tokyo Bay port around 4:30 p. m. local time, officials said after the wreck, adding that the container ship was operating under charter to a Japanese shipping company. Photos of the Crystal showed damage to its bow. Shipping zone can be precarious, The area where the wreck happened is known for heavy maritime traffic, the Japanese coast guard said. About 400 to 500 ships pass through the zone each day, the service said. The last known fatal incident there was in September 2015, when a South Korean vessel and a Japanese container ship collided, Japans coast guard reported. Six Japanese crew were declared dead.  The area has seen two other major collisions in the past five years. In such a busy shipping lane, the ships may have been in a restricted navigation situation, meaning they would have had o observe strict rules for movement and positioning in relation to other vessels in their vicinity, said Carl Schuster, former director of operations at the US Pacific Commands Joint Intelligence Center and a Hawaii Pacific University professor. Those rules leave vessels little room to maneuver, as turning away from one ship could place a vessel at risk of an even more serious incident with another, Schuster said. The Fitzgerald is an Arleigh     destroyer with a crew of approximately 330 sailors. The   vessel is 505 feet long. It completed $21 million in upgrades and repairs in February and is   to Yokosuka, supporting security and stability in the    region, the service said. The   container ship, which handles general cargo, includes a captain and a crew of 20, NYK said. It was built in 2008 and is about 730 feet long. The larger size of the container ship could have left the smaller US destroyer vulnerable in the collision, Schuster said. The force of the impact could have thrown overboard sailors who were standing on the opposite side of the destroyer from where it was struck, he said. That could account for the missing sailors, who may have been on deck on watch or even just relaxing in the night air, he said. Sailors also could have been trapped in compartments below deck, Schuster said, pointing out that container ships have a bulbous bow below the water line, which may have plowed into the US warship. Experienced commander in charge, Benson, the Fitzgeralds commander, was new to the position, having taken command of the vessel May 13 after serving as the ships executive officer, or second in command, since November 2015, the Navy said last month. The Fitzgerald is the second command for Benson, a 1999 Naval ROTC graduate of Marquette University. He commanded the minesweeper USS Guardian, operating out of Sasebo, Japan, from 2008 to 2010, before taking shore assignments in Washington and with US Pacific Command. The collision was the second in the region for US Navy warship in just more than a month. On May 9, the   cruiser USS Lake Champlain was struck by a South Korean fishing boat off the Korean Peninsula. No injuries were reported in that incident, which a Navy official said occurred when the fishing boats crew did not have a radio to hear warnings from the US warship. The   cruiser USS Antietam ran aground in late January while anchoring near Yokosuka, damaging its propellers and discharging 1, 100 gallons of hydraulic oil into the bay. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described the status of the commanding officer. He was transported by medevac for treatment."
Report: Dem Staffers Boo Trump at Unity Baseball Game - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/16/2017,"Thursday nights Congressional Baseball Game was hailed as the ultimate sign of bipartisan unity, but dozens of Democrat staffers reportedly cursed, booed, and jeered when President Donald Trump appeared on the video screen at Nationals Park to deliver a message of unity.

Civil Rights Commission Launches Investigation into Trump Admin. - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/16/2017,"The U. S. Commission on Civil Rights says it is launching a   comprehensive assessment into the Trump administration, in light of proposed budget cuts and staff eliminations that it says will cause the civil rights of people of color, the LGBT community, and other marginalized groups to be at risk. [Americans deserve better.  This civil rights rollback is dangerous for all of us.  https:  .      Catherine E. Lhamon (@CatherineLhamon) June 15, 2017,   According to a press release, the commission, which was created in 1957 as an independent agency that advises Congress and the president on civil rights matters, unanimously approved the investigation. The press statement says the commission is especially concerned with what it perceives as the Department of Justice minimizing its civil rights efforts by placing ICE officers in courthouses and by not emphasizing the need for protection for the LGBT community or the disabled. In the Department of Education, the commission says the proposed budget and staffing cuts in the Office for Civil Rights will affect those filing complaints based on sex, race, and other specially protected class categories. Proposed staffing and budget cuts, and mergers of various offices in the Departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, Health and Human Services will all have a negative impact on the federal governments job to monitor civil rights compliance efforts, says the commission. The investigation is launched as   ProPublica released an internal memo     sent by Acting Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights Candice Jackson     it says it obtained that suggests the Department of Education has laid out plans to loosen requirements on investigations into civil rights complaints.  ProPublica says: Under the Obama administration, the departments office for civil rights applied an expansive approach to investigations. Individual complaints related to complex issues such as school discipline, sexual violence and harassment, equal access to educational resources, or racism at a single school might have prompted broader probes to determine whether the allegations were part of a pattern of discrimination or harassment. The new memo, sent by Candice Jackson, the acting assistant secretary for civil rights, to regional directors at the departments civil rights office, trims this approach. Breitbart News reported in April ProPublicas concern that Jackson once complained that she experienced discrimination because she is white.  When an undergraduate at Stanford University, Jackson was critical of an extra help section of a class held solely for minority students. I am especially disappointed that the University encourages these and other discriminatory programs, she wrote at Stanford Review. We need to allow each person to define his or her own achievements instead of assuming competence or incompetence based on race.  So grateful to hear today from @EByard @MaraKeisling @rea_carey. @MaraKeisling summarized: we are the storm raining down justice https:  .      Catherine E. Lhamon (@CatherineLhamon) June 16, 2017,  However, Vanita Gupta, the former acting head of the DOJs civil rights division under Obama, said, At best, this administration believes that civil rights enforcement is superfluous and can be easily cut. At worst, it really is part of a systematic agenda to roll back civil rights.  In an emailed statement to ProPublica, Elizabeth Hill, press secretary for the U. S. Education Department, said the new enforcement instructions seek to clear out the backlog while giving every complaint the individualized and thorough consideration it deserves.  The commission is composed of eight commissioners. Four are appointed by the president and four by Congress. The commissioners serve   terms and are not confirmed by the Senate. Currently, four members of the commission are Democrats, three are independents, and one is a Republican. The four presidential appointees were all selected by former President Barack Obama. For 60 years, Congress has charged the Commission to monitor Federal civil rights enforcement and recommend necessary change, says commission chairwoman Catherine E. Lhamon, an Obama appointee. We take this charge seriously, and we look forward to reporting our findings to Congress, the President, and the American people."
Sports Media and Gay Activists Blast Cardinals for Inviting Lance Berkman to Christian Day at Busch Stadium - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,6/16/2017,"The St. Louis Cardinals have found themselves in the crosshairs of the LGBT community for inviting former Cardinal Lance Berkman to the teams annual Christian Day event. [Berkmans presence sparks controversy amongst the gay community because of his role in the fight against the transgender bathroom ordinance, aka the Equal Rights Ordinance, in Houston in 2015.  Pride Center of St. Louis issued this highly critical statement of the Cardinals decision to invite Berkman: Pride St. Louis is disappointed by the decision of the St. Louis Cardinals to provide a public platform for Berkman, an individual whose words and actions towards the LGBTQ+ are divisive and demeaning.  The group initially released the statement to Outsports, an SB Nation website which prioritizes news involving the LGBT community and sports. According to the St. Louis   On its own, Outsports has called Berkman a bigot and an outspoken opponent of the LGBT community who was one of the faces of the campaign against Houstons   ordinance in 2015.  Despite the backlash, as of this writing, the Cardinals remain committed to having Berkman attend Christian Day.  The team issued their own statement in response to those troubled by the move: The Cardinals have hosted a Christian Day at the ballpark for nearly three decades. Lance Berkman participated in Christian Day when he was a Cardinals player, and we welcome him back this year to discuss his faith.  The Cardinals also said they plan to host an event in support of the LGBT community at some point later in the season. Nonetheless, the team makes a good point here. Berkman has attended and spoken at these events before when he, presumably, held the same views towards transgender bathroom laws that he does now. So, whats the problem? Since its likely that the bathroom issue never would have come up on a night dedicated to celebrating the Christian faith, does the LGBT community really want to put the idea out there that theyre fine with tolerating and accepting all things unless Christianity is involved? In his article on the Cardinals invitation to Berkman, Bill Baer wrote that Berkman foolishly advocated against public accommodations for transgender people to use public bathrooms.  What was foolish about this? The part where he exercised his constitutional right to express an opinion in a free country? It seems like Bill Baers attitude toward tolerance and acceptance is much the same as Outsports and the LGBT communitys attitude: acceptance and tolerance for all      unless they disagree with me.

"NJ High School That Censored Trump T-Shirt in Yearbook Promises to Reprint Full Run, No Charge",Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/16/2017,"The New Jersey high school that earned criticism for censoring photos and quotes favorable to President Donald Trump in the school yearbook has now promised to reprint the entire book without the censorship and at the expense of the school. [Wall Township High School Superintendent Cheryl Dyer announced the coming reissue of the yearbook in a letter to parents noting that the fresh copies will be available in two weeks, according to NJ. com.  I cannot allow the intentional change that was not based on dress code to be ignored, Dyer wrote in the letter. I am the Chief School Administrator in this district, and I take responsibility for the actions of those who are employed here. Therefore, I have determined that a   of the yearbook is necessary.  The controversy arose last week after students received their yearbooks and two students noticed that their Donald Trump shirts had been censored out of their class photo, one by cropping and another by photoshopping. A third student found that a Donald Trump quote she wanted to be printed next to her photo was left out. A few days after the story was picked up by the national media, the teacher responsible for the censorship was placed on suspension. Superintendent Dyer later confirmed that the teacher, Susan Parsons, a   veteran of the school district, was put on suspension with pay while the district decided what else it might do about the incident. On Monday, parent Joseph Berardo was very critical of the schools act of censorship and demanded that Wall High School pay to have all the books reprinted at the districts expense as a teaching moment about students First Amendment rights. I want a letter from the administration explaining why the yearbooks are being reissued, and it should be used as a teaching moment related to the First Amendment in civil discourse, Mr. Berardo said, according to the New York Post. In early reports, Superintendent Dyer had said she thought correcting the photos and republishing the yearbook was not likely. But as the controversy grew in scope, the decision was made to run the reprints. Dyer said that in the future she would insist that checks and balances be implemented to ensure that intentional alterations that are not consistent with district policy do not continue.

Minnesota Cop Found Not Guilty in Philando Castile Shooting Trial,Breitbart,Lana Shadwick,6/16/2017,"The Minnesota officer who has been on trial for the murder in the shooting death of a black motorist has been found not guilty. The verdict was announced around 2:55 p. m. on Friday. [St. Anthony police Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified during the trial that    Philando Castile had his hand on a gun.  A Facebook video live streamed by Diamond Reynolds, his girlfriend who was in the car, went viral. She narrated as Castile sat dying. Officer Yanez fatally shot Castile on July 6 after a traffic stop in Falcon Heights, a suburb in St. Paul, Minnesota. At the time, there was a question as to whether Castile was a suspect in a recent convenience store robbery. Officer Yanez faced charges of manslaughter and reckless discharge of a weapon. The Minnesota jury has been deliberating this week. Shortly after the shooting, Officer Yanez lawyer said, I can tell you that the stop of the vehicle for an equipment violation was not the only reason for the stop.  A handgun was recovered at the scene. During the Facebook live stream, Reynolds said, police just shot my boyfriend for no apparent reason.  Castile had a concealed handgun license. During Yanez trial, a police force expert testified that the officer was justified in his use of force. Expert Joe Dutton told jurors When Yanez saw the   grip of Castiles hand, he had to react to the actions of Mr. Castile, reported the CBS affiliate in Minnesota. He added, This truly was a   decision, there wasnt time to do anything else.  A firefighter testified that he heard Castiles gun drop to the ground from his pocket when he put him on a stretcher. Officer Yanez took the stand in his defense. He testified that he stopped Castiles car after Castile drove past him and gave him a deer in the headlights look that made him suspicious. Its a trigger, he testified. The officer was already on alert after the convenience store robbery and Castile looked like one of the robbery suspects. He radioed his partner that he was going to pull the car over because [t]he two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery, Minnesotas Star Tribune reported. He also had legal grounds to pull Castile over because he was driving with a broken brake light. Yanez walked up to the car, and he could smell burnt or burning marijuana, he testified. The officer told the jury he saw Castiles hand on the gun and Castile did not follow his instructions not to reach for the gun. He told the jury, I told him, Dont pull it out, but when he saw Castile pull out the top of the gun, Thats when I engaged Mr. Castile and shot him.  The officer testified when he saw Castiles gun, my family popped into my head. My wife. My baby girl.  I did not want to shoot Mr. Castile at all.  Those were not my intentions.  After the shooting, Castiles mother, Valerie Castile, reportedly told CNN, I think he was just black in the wrong place.  Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton further fanned the flame of racial tension when he asked at a press conference after the shooting     Would this have happened if the driver and passenger were white?  He answered his question saying     I dont think it would have, reported Fox 9 News in  . Paul. As can be heard in the video, the officer told the girlfriend, I told him not to reach for it.

Jared Kushners finances and business dealings are now a focus of the Trump-Russia investigation,Business Insider,Mark Abadi,6/16/2017,"The business dealings of Jared Kushner have become a focus in   special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russian   interference in the 2016 election, according to a Washington Post    Thursday night.     Kushner, the adviser and    of President Donald Trump,   met separately with the Russian ambassador to the US and a   Russian businessman in December     interactions that were already   under scrutiny as part of the FBI probe.     Sources informed The Post of the financial focus of the   investigation.     During the meeting at Trump Tower with the Russian ambassador,   Sergey Kislyak, Kushner reportedly floated the possibility of   establishing a   line of communication between the   Trump transition team and Russia.     The White House has said that Kushners subsequent meeting with   Sergey Gorkov, CEO of Russias   Vnesheconombank, was   unrelated to business matters. But the FBI is  whether Gorkov suggested to Kushner that Russian   banks could finance the business ventures of Trumps associates   if US sanctions were lifted or relaxed.      Kushner attorney Jamie Gorelick pushed back on the report in a   statement Thursday evening.     We do not know what this report refers to, Gorelick said. It   would be standard practice for the Special Counsel to examine   financial records to look for anything related to Russia. Mr.   Kushner previously volunteered to share with Congress what he   knows about   matters. He will do the same if he is   contacted in connection with any other inquiry.     The development marks another expansion of the FBI probe, whose   scope had previously been limited to uncovering whether Trumps   campaign colluded with the Kremlin during the 2016 election. The   Post reported on Wednesday that Mueller was  to prove whether the president attempted   to obstruct justice.     In an   tweetstorm, Trump blasted the investigation   as a witch hunt and a phony story.     You are witnessing the single greatest WITCH HUNT in American   political history   led by some very bad and conflicted people!    in a tweet.     According to Thursdays Post report, investigators have also been   looking into the financial dealings of other Trump associates,   including former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Trumps   former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former     adviser Carter Page.

"MARKO, SOON, ET AL: To Put America First Is to Put Our Planets Climate First - Breitbart",Breitbart,Willie Soon and Istvn Mark,6/16/2017,"The article below was contributed by Istvan Marko, J. Scott Armstrong, William M. Briggs, Kesten Green, Hermann Harde, David R. Legates, Christopher Monckton of Brenchley, and Willie Soon. [On June 2, 2017, in a Letter regarding US withdrawal from Paris climate agreement addressed to the MIT community, Professor Rafael Reif, president of MIT, criticized President Trumps decision to exit the Paris Climate Accords. In this refutation, we propose to clarify the scientific understanding of the Earths climate and to dispel the expensively fostered popular delusion that   global warming will be dangerous and that, therefore, the Paris Agreement would be beneficial.  Professor Reif wrote, Yesterday, the White House took the position that the Paris climate agreement     a landmark effort to combat global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions     was a bad deal for America.  There is no science unambiguously establishing that CO2 is the chief cause of the warming observed since the end of the Little Ice Age. The opposite has been repeatedly demonstrated. Ice cores have revealed that changes in CO2 concentration follow, rather than precede, changes in temperature. During the last deglaciation, the latest   records show atmospheric CO2 lagging temperature by 50 to 500 years. Our enterprises and industries return to the air some of the CO2 that was formerly present there, and some warming may be expected. That warming will be small and beneficial. Professor Humlum and colleagues have demonstrated that changes in CO2 concentration follow changes in temperature after about   months. The   between changes in temperature and consequent changes in CO2 concentration are caused by outgassing of CO2 from the oceans when they warm and uptake by the oceans as they cool. In addition, the growth rate of the atmospheric CO2 has been slowing recently, linked to an enhanced terrestrial biosphere uptake. Our contribution to atmospheric CO2 adds to the effect of these fluctuations, but it does not add much. One of us (Harde 2017) has reached similar conclusions. Professor Reifs assertion that global temperatures can be regulated by an international agreement to atone for our sins of emission is, therefore, at odds with scientific knowledge regarding cause and effect. King Canutes warning to his English courtiers in 1032 A. D. that even the divinely anointed monarch could not command sea level should be heeded by bombastic intergovernmental agencies a millennium later. The professors assertion is, moreover, logically invalid, since the Paris agreement permits China and India to industrialize without limit on their emissions. Besides, the Paris agreement is not binding. Under its terms, no nation is compelled to sin no more, and many     even including Germany and Denmark, the leaders in renewable energies     now appear unlikely to meet the agreements targets. The Paris agreement is, in practice, a political tool for suppressing growth and redistributing wealth. Dr. Rajendra Pachauri, former chairman of the IPCC, said, in resigning in 2015, that the environment was his religion, and Ms. Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the U. N. Framework Convention on Climate Change until last year, openly stated in 2015 that the goal was to overturn capitalism     in her words, to change the economic development model that has been reigning for at least 150 years, since the industrial revolution.  Professor Reif writes, The scientific consensus is overwhelming.  The late author Michael Crichton, in his Caltech Michelin Lecture 2003, said, In science consensus is irrelevant.        There is no such thing as consensus science. If its consensus, it isnt science. If its science, it isnt consensus. Period.  Doubt is the seedcorn of science. Consensus is a political notion which, when pleaded, indicates that the pleader is totalitarian. As Abu Ali ibn   said in the eleventh century: The seeker after truth [his splendid definition of the scientist] does not place his faith in any mere consensus, however venerable or widespread. Instead, he subjects what he has learned of it to his   scientific knowledge, and to investigation, inspection, inquiry, checking, checking and checking again. The road to the truth is long and hard, but that is the road we must follow. The alleged consensus is nothing more than an agreement that the weather has warmed in the past 300 years. Yet the quantum and attribution of warming are hotly debated among climatologists. Even today, measuring global temperature is subject to errors, biases, missing data, and subjective adjustments. The estimation of global average temperature from satellite data is relatively new and employs a completely different temperature measurement method from the older methods. Nevertheless, the satellite data and balloon data have provided essentially identical estimates. Neither displays a worrying trend. Both are increasingly at odds not only with the surface temperature records, all of which have been adjusted ex post facto so as to show more warming than the original raw data showed, but also with the alarming projections of the serially unreliable computer models of climate on which the U. N.s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change profitably but misguidedly relies. Scientists agree that climate changes. It has done so since the first wisps of the Earths atmosphere formed, but they disagree on the causes of climate changes, including the mild warming since the Little Ice Age. Legates et al. (2015) for example, found that only 0. 3 percent of 11, 944   articles on climate and related topics, published during the 21 years of 1991 to 2011, had explicitly stated that recent warming was mostly  . Professor Reif wrote, As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.  In the last 20 years, we have released more than a third of all the CO2 produced since the beginning of the industrial period. Yet global mean surface temperature has remained essentially constant for 20 years, a fact that has been acknowledged by the IPCC, whose models failed to predict it. NOAAs State of the Climate report for 2008 said that periods of 15 years or more without warming would indicate a discrepancy between prediction and observation     i. e. that the models were wrong. Just before the recent naturally occurring el Nio event raised global temperature, there had been 18 years and 9 months without any global warming at all. The climate models relied upon by the IPCC and the politicians they advise have predicted warming at about twice the rate observed during the past 27 years, during which the Earth has warmed at 0. 4 C, about half of the 0. 75 C   warming rate implicit in IPCCs explicit 1990 prediction that there would be 1. 0 C warming from  .   Green and Armstrong (2014) conducted   validation tests of the models and found that their forecasts were much less accurate than assuming there had been no global warming at all. The relative inaccuracy of the IPCC projections increased with longer ( ) horizons. Even forecasts of natural global cooling at a rate of 1 C per century were much more accurate over long periods than the IPCCs projections of dangerous   global warming. Ten years ago, Al Gore asserted that global temperatures had reached a dangerous tipping point, with extreme warming imminent and unavoidable. Professor Scott Armstrong challenged Mr. Gore to a   bet based on the    (2009)) scientific   forecast of global mean temperatures. Mr. Gore declined the bet, but theclimatebet. com website keeps track of how the bet would have turned out. With the   life of the bet due to end at the end of this year, the cumulative monthly error in the IPCCs    0. 3 C per decade prediction is 22 percent larger than the error from the benchmark prediction of no warming at all. Why does Professor Reif continue to champion the notion of dangerous manmade global warming when it is so greatly at odds with observation? Professor Reif wrote, As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.  The average sea level rise since 1870 has been 1. .5 mm (about a twentieth of an inch) per year. Professor   Mrner, a renowned   researcher who has published more than 500   articles on this topic, has been unable to find observational evidence that supports the models predictions of dramatically accelerating sea level rise. Professor Reif wrote, As human activities emit more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, the global average surface temperature will continue to rise, driving rising sea levels and extreme weather.  Observations during the last few decades indicate that extreme events, including tornadoes and hurricanes, have been decreasing, rather than increasing, both in number and in intensity. Moreover, the total accumulated cyclonic energy has also been declining. As MIT Emeritus Professor Richard Lindzen has explained, the decline in storminess is a consequence of reduced temperature differentials between the tropics and   that arise when global average temperatures are warmer. Professor Reif wrote, As the Pentagon describes it, climate change is a threat multiplier because its direct effects intensify other challenges, including mass migrations and   conflicts over existential resources like water and food.  Milder temperatures and increased CO2 levels green the planet, instead of browning it. Deserts are retreating, and vegetation cover has increased throughout recent decades. The production of maize, wheat, rice, and soybeans is at a record high. More CO2 in the air helps plants by CO2 fertilization. Our planet has seen more than 20 percent greening during the past three decades, half of which is due to the action of CO2. Forecasts of droughts are also not borne out by experience. For example, since the   Australian Chief Climate Commissioner Professor Tim Flannery warned that dams would no longer fill owing to lack of rain, Australia has been subjected to a series of dramatic floods and overflowing dams. Governments nave belief in Professor Flannerys warnings appear to have led to policy actions and omissions that exacerbated flooding and failed to take full advantage of the rainfall when it came. The most comprehensive recent study of the worldwide extent of droughts (Hao et al. 2014) found that for 30 years the percentage of the Earths land mass under drought or severe drought has been declining. Though the U. N. Environment Program had published in 2005 a document predicting 50 million climate refugees by 2010, to date there have been no bona fide climate refugees. Nor has mass migration owing to global warming been observed. The one person recognized as a climate refugee had his demand rejected by the Supreme Court of New Zealand. He has returned to his island home, where he remains safe from inundation. Professor Reif wrote, The carbon dioxide our cars and power plants emit today will linger in the atmosphere for a thousand years.  The average residence time of a CO2 molecule in the Earths atmosphere is about four to seven years. Taking into account multiple exchanges leads to an estimate of a mean lifespan of 40 years (Harde 2017). Rather than a problem, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is the prime nutrient for plants. Indeed, plants grow more strongly when CO2 concentrations are much higher than they currently are, which is why commercial greenhouses add CO2 to the air. The current CO2 concentration is higher than for 800, 000 years, but it is far lower than at almost any time in the previous history of our planet. Nor is CO2 a pollutant. It is a colorless, odorless gas that is not toxic to humans and other animals even at concentrations much higher than we are currently experiencing. It is also one of the most important fuels for phytoplankton, which use carbon dioxide for energy and that release oxygen. Up to 75 percent of the oxygen present in the air originates in the phytoplankton photosynthetic   process. Moreover, during the Paleozoic and Mesozoic eras, there were long periods during which the levels of CO2 were much higher than today, but the temperatures were far colder. We are not aware of any explanation that squares the   global warming theory with that fact. Professor Reif wrote, In 2016 alone, solar industry employment grew by 25 percent, while wind jobs grew 32 percent.  Growing jobs by subsidy is easy, provided that one cares nothing for the far greater number of jobs destroyed by the additional taxation, energy price hikes, or public borrowing necessary to pay for the subsidy. Several studies have shown that the creation of one green job results in the loss of two jobs elsewhere in the economy. Despite all those subsidies, solar power accounts for 0. 9 percent and wind generation for 5. 6 percent of total U. S. electricity production. Electricity itself is a small fraction of total energy consumption, including transportation, industrial processes, and heating. The   alternative energy companies survive through heavy subsidies and supportive regulations. For example, SunEdison received $1. 5 billion in subsidies and loan guarantees, and yet it was compelled to file for bankruptcy. Solyndra is another example.   renewable energy is cripplingly expensive to the customer but is often unprofitable even after massive subsidies from taxpayers. Europe is suffering from political rejection of fossil fuels: energy prices have soared, millions of poor people are unable to pay their energy bills, and   businesses are relocating to where energy is cheaper. Theirs is not an example the U. S. should wish to follow. By withdrawing from the Paris agreement, President Trump did a wonderful thing for America and the world. He showed that advocacy masquerading as science should not be the basis for political decisions. He showed that to put America first is to put the planet first. And, by rejecting the   of   global warming, he began the long and necessary process of waking up the likes of Professor Reif to the fact that the diversion of time, effort, and trillions of dollars away from real environmental problems and towards the bogus but (to MIT) profitable   of supposedly catastrophic global warming is as bad for the planet as it is for true science."
Amnesty: DHS Kelly Spotlighted DACA Legal Problem As He Ended DAPA - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/16/2017,"The administrations announcement ending the   DAPA amnesty quietly cuts the legal legs off the   DACA amnesty for younger illegals, despite   claims that President Donald Trump has accepted former President Barack Obamas DACA  . [Amid the   cheering, officials denied that Trump had accepted the DACA amnesty.   The DAPA and DACA [amnesties] are two different programs        The fact that DACA was not rescinded by the same memo should not be interpreted as bearing any relevance on the   future of that program, said a memo issued Friday by the Department of Homeland Security. The future of the DACA program continues to be under review with the Administration.  For several months, administration officials, led by President Donald Trump, have suggested the DACA program will continue for some time.   In contrast, the DAPA amnesty for roughly 4 million   parents of U.  children has been frozen since early 2015 partly because a group of Governors persuaded multiple judges to stop the amnesty. The governors argued that Obama was telling deputies to defer prosecutorial action     deportation     against large numbers of people without conducting the    legal review required by the courts and Congress.  That    requirement helps explains why 2012 DACA is just as unlawful as 2014 DAPA        and would fall if challenged, said a statement from Dale Wilcox, the Executive Director and General Counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, which advocates for immigration policies that serve the national interest.  Roughly 765, 000 younger illegals have received Social Security Numbers and   from Obamas DACA amnesty, which Trump has not stopped yet.  In his June 15 statement announcing the end of DAPA, Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly highlighted the lethal legal flaw in DACA when he said DAPA was indefensible in court and noted I remind our officers that (1) deferred action, as an act of prosecutorial discretion, may only be granted on a    basis.  The chief obstacle to a lawsuit which ends DACA is first persuading judges that state officials or individuals, such as legal immigrants, are clearly disadvantaged by the continued operation of the DACA amnesty, said one lawyer.   reformers are hoping a lawsuit will force DHS to end the program     and thus pressure Democrats to accept   immigration reforms in exchange for a formal amnesty of the DACA beneficiaries.  Some   reformers are hoping a lawsuit will force DHS to end the program     and thus pressure Democrats in Congress to accept a package of   immigration reforms in exchange for a formal congressional amnesty of the DACA beneficiaries.  Both the DACA and DAPA amnesties are based on the unprecedented claim by President Barack Obama that agency officials have the authority to stop enforcing Congress laws against entire categories of people, providing the benefits were reviewed and granted on a    basis. The 2014 DAPA amnesty, for example, told   officials to defer enforcement of deportation law while accomplishing a    review of an entire class       parents of   anchor babies children born in the United States. The 2012 DACA amnesty was titled Deferred Action Against Child Arrivals because it told officials to stop enforcing immigration law against an entire class     illegals who were brought as children to the United States     while also granted the   after conducting    reviews.  But judges in the DAPA case noted there is little or no    review of amnesty awards to the beneficiaries in the DACA amnesty. A   panel, for example, found in 2015 that   Secretary Jeh Johnson further instructed that: Like the DAPA Memo, the DACA Memo instructed agencies to review applications on a    basis and exercise discretion, but the district court found that those statements were merely pretext because only about 5% of the 723, 000 applications accepted for evaluation had been denied, and [d]espite a request by the [district] [c]ourt, the [g]overnments counsel did not provide the number, if any, of requests that were denied [for discretionary reasons] even though the applicant met the DACA criteria . . . .   The finding of pretext was also based on a declaration by Kenneth Palinkas, the president of the union representing the USCIS employees processing the DACA applications, that DHS management has taken multiple steps to ensure that DACA applications are simply rubberstamped if the applicants meet the necessary criteria.  In a footnote to the November 2015 judgment, the judges also noted that Obamas deputies at DHS could not cite any members of the class who were denied the benefit once they filled out the form correctly, saying:  USCIS could not produce any applications that satisfied all of the criteria but were refused deferred action by an exercise of discretion       ([A]ll were denied for failure to meet the criteria or rejected for technical filing errors, errors in filling out the form or lying on the form, and failures to pay fees) or for fraud. ).  Given that the government offered no evidence as to the bases for other denials, it was not errorclear or otherwisefor the district court to conclude that DHS issued DACA denials under mechanical formulae.  The Friday statement from DHS said that DAPAs elimination does not mean that DACA is accepted or on safe legal ground: The announcement made by the Department of Homeland Security on June 15, 2017 specifically referred to rescinding the memorandum signed on November 20, 2014 that created the program known as Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA) which was never implemented.  The rescission only addressed DAPA based on the litigation posture and lack of a credible path forward in court.    DAPA and DACA are two different programs.  Yesterday, based on litigation, the Administration decided to rescind DAPA.  The fact that DACA was not rescinded by the same memo should not be interpreted as bearing any relevance on the   future of that program. The future of the DACA program continues to be under review with the Administration.  With regard to DACA, the President has remarked on the need to handle the issue with compassion and with heart.  Secretary Kelly recognizes that Congress is the only entity that can provide a legislate a   solution to this issue. In his letter announcing the end of DAPA, Kelly also hinted that DACA could share the same fate as DAPA, saying I remind our officers that (1) deferred action, as an act of prosecutorial discretion, may only be granted on a    basis, and (2) such a grant may be terminated at any time at the agencys discretion.  Liberal   groups recognize that DACA is not on safe grounds. For example, the ACLU cautiously celebrated the Kelly decision before warning supporters about Trumps   immigration policies, saying: The Trump administration said the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, which allows hundreds of thousands of undocumented youth to live and work legally in the U. S. remains in effect. Lorella Praeli, director of immigration policy and campaigns at the American Civil Liberties Union, had this reaction: The only certainty in Trumps America is uncertainty     and no memoranda changes that. Theyre trying to distract us with their    on DACA as their mass deportation machine proceeds full speed ahead."
7 Celebrities Who Believe Its Not Their Job to Talk Politics,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson &amp Daniel Nussbaum,6/16/2017,"The 2016 presidential campaign and subsequent election of Donald Trump inspired some of Hollywoods biggest stars to find their political voices. [From Meryl Streeps   speech at the Golden Globes to the numerous     Clinton public service announcements during the campaign,   celebrities have kicked up their political advocacy considerably in the last few years.  However, not every Hollywood star wants to talk about politics, or even thinks its their obligation to do so. Below is a list of celebrities who believe its not their job to discuss politics in public.   1. Billy Joel,     singer Billy Joel said this month that he doesnt believe its an entertainers place to push their personal brand of politics on their fans. I try to stay out of politics. I am a private citizen and I have a right to believe in my own political point of view, but I try not to get up on a soapbox and tell people how to think, Joel said in an interview with Rolling Stone.  Entertainers, the Piano Man singer said, are more like court jesters than court philosophers.  2. Mark Wahlberg, In an interview last year with Task  Purpose, the    Patriots Day star said he thinks celebrities should stick to entertaining Americans, because a lot of Hollywood is living in a bubble.  A lot of celebrities did, do, and shouldnt [talk about politics], Wahlberg said. You know, it just goes to show you that people arent listening to that anyway. They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you dont put food on their table. You dont pay their bills.  Theyre pretty out of touch with the common person, the everyday guy out there providing for their family, he added. Me, Im very aware of the real world. I come from the real world and I exist in the real world. And although I can navigate Hollywood and I love the business and the opportunities its afforded me, I also understand what its like not to have all that.  3. Kevin Hart, The   comedy superstar and Hollywood   said he believes celebrities run the risk of alienating their audience when they enter the political fray. When you jump into that political realm youre alienating some of your audience, Hart said in an interview with Variety.  The world today, its really not a laughing matter. Its serious, he added. I dont want to draw attention to things I dont have nice things to say about.  4. Gene Simmons  The rock legend and KISS frontman didnt mince words when asked his thoughts on politically opinionated stars. I think celebrities should basically shut their pie holes and do what they do best     act, sing, tap dance, juggle balls, and all that kind of stuff, Simmons said in an interview last year with Fox Business. 5. Reba McEntire, The country music icon said that when she steps on stage, her only mission is to provide some enjoyment and escape for the fans who have bought tickets to see her. I take it this way: they have paid their   money to come in there and fill a seat     parking, getting something at the concession stand, go and eat before the concert     I am there to entertain them, to take their worries away from them, so when they walk out, they can kind of have a little lift in their step and go, Aw, that was such a great break from all the problems I have to deal with during daily life. So Im not going to give them my political views, the     told the hosts of The View in February. Asked if her decision to keep quiet about her political views is for fear of losing half her audience, McEntire said, Thats not as important as this is my job to entertain. It shouldnt be my platform to be up on stage giving my political views.  6. Josh Duhamel, The Transformers: The Last Knight star doesnt think its important to tell people how to vote.  In a recent interview with Fox News, Duhamel said Thats one thing I dont do. I dont like to get involved politically at all. Nobody cares what I think politically.  Anybody in entertainment who thinks people care what they think politically are really misinformed, the actor added. Thats one thing I stay away from. I stay away from politics because nobody cares what I think.  7. Gillian Anderson, The   star says she avoids giving political opinions on topics like President Trump and Brexit during interviews, because she believes she is not well informed enough to speak about them. I generally have a tendency to steer away from outright political discussion in interviews, because I am an actor, and theres so much that I dont understand, and I dont for a second feel like I have a right to that platform, Anderson said in a March interview with The Guardian. I dont want to get into a discussion about Trump or about Brexit or any of that     I feel its best left to people who really understand the very, very complex issue, she said. Not for a second am I going to pitch in, because I dont really know what it is that Im talking about. I have opinions, but I dont think my opinions are more valid because Im an actor and have more of a platform than others.

Texas Enacts Anti-Sharia Law,Breitbart,Merrill Hope,6/16/2017,"Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law House Bill 45, more commonly known as American Laws for American Courts, or ALAC. It prohibits the use of any foreign law in the states courts, specifically in family cases that involve marriage or   relationship matters. [One of the bills   Representative Jeff Leach ( ) thanked the governor, who signed HB 45 on Wednesday. Leach called the law vitally important bill to further safeguard and protect our Constitutional rights! In the last legislative session, Leach authored the comparable yet unsuccessful ALAC measure, House Bill 562.   HB 45 lead author Representative Dan Flynn ( ) also introduced similar past legislation that failed. In a recent press release, Flynn noted foreign law is often applied in Texas cases concerning divorce orders, child support, property settlements and sometime even, spouses enter into agreements to have foreign law applied to their disputes. My colleagues and I here at the Texas Legislature want to make sure Texas judges never apply foreign law in Texas courts in violation of constitutional rights and the public policy of our state, said Flynn. Under HB 45, Texas and U. S. law supersede all other laws. It prevents state judges from applying any foreign law because, in doing so, it infringes upon U. S. and Texas constitutional rights. The bill shields litigants in family law cases against violations of constitutional rights and public policy in the application of foreign law under the U. S. and Texas Constitutions, federal and judicial precedent, the Texas Family Code, and the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, among other protections. HB 45 makes no mention of any particular foreign nation, religion, or cultural practice but clarifies that foreign law means a rule, law, or code from a jurisdiction outside of the United States and it shall not override U. S and Texas law or their respective constitutions. It specifies that a foreign judgment means a ruling from a court, tribunal, or administrative adjudicator outside U. S. states and territories. The bill underscores that, in the event of any legal conflicts, federal or state law prevails.  In January 2015, Breitbart Texas confirmed in a report that an Islamic tribunal using Sharia law operated in Dallas. Dr. Taher   one of four attorneys who called themselves judges and not arbitrators, claimed the tribunal and its decisions were voluntary.    said the tribunal operated under Sharia as a form of   dispute resolution in civil disputes in family and business cases but also admitted that when in conflict between Sharia and Texas law, we follow Sharia law.  In December 2015, Flynn asked Attorney General Ken Paxton the extent to which current law authorizes or requires a judge of a state court to apply foreign law in certain family law disputes.  Last year, Paxton ruled in a   nonbinding legal opinion: Under Texas law, a court is not required in family law disputes to enforce a foreign law if enforcement would be contrary to Texas public policy or if it would violate a partys basic right to due process.  However, according to the Attorney Generals office, Paxtons opinion only constituted a written interpretation of existing law and did not decide any law. The Texas chapter of the Council for   Relations (CAIR) called HB 45   law and lobbied for the states Muslim community to oppose the bill. We believe it prevents Muslims from practicing their faith in areas such as Islamic marriage, divorce, funeral procedures, and civil agreements, they said in a press release. HB 45 requires the Texas Supreme Court adopt its rules by January 1, 2018. The law goes into effect on September 1, making Texas the 12th state to enact ALAC. The other states are Alabama, Arizona, Florida, Kansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Dakota, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Washington, according to ACT for America.

Sharp Rise in Violent Islamist Extremists in Sweden After Migrant Influx,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/16/2017,"STOCKHOLM (AFP)     The number of violent Islamist extremists in Sweden has soared from 200 in 2010 to thousands intelligence agency Sapo said Friday, while noting that only a handful were deemed able to carry out a terror attack. [We would say that (the number) has gone from hundreds to thousands now, Sapo chief Anders Thornberg told news agency TT in an interview, describing the situation as serious.  This is the new normal        It is a historic challenge that extremist circles are growing, he said. He stressed, however, that only a few of the thousands had both the intention and ability to carry out a terror attack. A 2010 Sapo report estimated the number of violent Islamist extremists in the Scandinavian country at 200. Thornberg attributed the rise primarily to the propaganda machine of the   Islamic State (IS) which has united different groups of Islamist extremists. We used to have different circles. We had radicalised (people) from North Africa, the Middle East and Somalia, but they were all separate, he said. Thornberg said Sapo now receives around 6, 000 intelligence tips a month concerning terrorism and extremism, compared to an average 2, 000 a month in 2012. Sapo has previously said that about 300 people from Sweden are known to have travelled to Syria and Iraq to join IS since 2012. Jihadists or sympathisers from Sweden have been linked to several terrorist attacks in recent years. On April 7, an Uzbek national who had shown sympathies for jihadist groups including IS used a stolen truck to mow down pedestrians on a busy shopping street, killing five people and injuring 15.

Six Pregnant Texas Women Test Positive for Zika,Breitbart,Merrill Hope,6/16/2017,"Six pregnant Texas woman tested positive for Zika health officials announced Thursday. The patients hailed from Harris County where, locally, this marked the first cases of the   virus reported this year. [In a press release, Legacy Community Health advised they screened these women for Zika months ago and gave them preliminary diagnoses. In May, Legacy learned from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) all of the pregnancies tested came back positive for Zika.  Legacy, a system of 29 clinics in southeast Texas, only released that the women contracted the virus while traveling outside of the United States and they delivered their babies. While Zika is generally a mild virus for most, pregnant women continue to be the most vulnerable population given the reported health risks to their unborn babies, most notably microcephaly, where a newborns head and brain only partially develops leaving the infant with a small, deformed head. It remains unknown if any of these infants were born with   birth defects. The threat of Zika is lower this year than last in our hemisphere, but as our six latest cases show, pregnant women in Texas should remain vigilant, said Dr. Ann Barnes, Legacys chief medical officer in a prepared statement. Last year, Legacy saw eight Zika cases. Patient education in Harris County must continue through this years mosquito season, she added. Prevention must be the key message coming from public health officials and health care providers.  Previously, the state reported 14 Zika cases in 2017, with a cumulative 323 cases since 2015. Texas Department of State Health Services spokesman Chris Van Deusen told Breitbart Texas that 206 of these cases were pregnant women who tested  . He said, of the 206, 148 gave birth and they know the outcome of these pregnancies: 13 of the live births or fetal losses had some form of Zika consistent birth defect. Four of the the 13 tested positive for Zika at birth, six did not test positive, and three, health officials did not have results yet. In November, the World Health Organization (WHO) called off its Zika global public health emergency. The continental U. S. witnessed a drop in these cases however, CDC alerts remain in effect for pregnant women to postpone travel to Cameron County in south Texas and to   County in south Florida. Last year, the CDC listed Cameron County in south Texas as a yellow area after five locally transmitted cases erupted in the countys main city Brownsville, Breitbart Texas reported. Breitbart Texas spoke to Zika expert, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of Baylor College of Medicines National School of Tropical Medicine. He indicated overall worldwide transmission was down but anticipated in Texas, mosquito numbers are probably going to be very high this year because its been a warm winter.  He said Zika transmission remains high in Peru, Ecuador, Argentina, and Bolivia but did not believe this would affect Texas since the majority of Zika came from travel to Mexico, much like in south Florida where traffic to the Caribbean sparked the Miami outbreak. Hotez cautioned that Mexico is just at the beginning of its rainy season. We may not be out of the woods and there could be a significant level of Zika transmission in Mexico this summer and that would have implications for south Texas.  He stated, If youre pregnant and living in south Texas you still need to be vigilant, adding that expectant mothers should have conversations with their obstetricians over protective measures. Hotez noted pregnant women in large urban areas like Houston, San Antonio, and Dallas should keep a watchful eye. The Aedes aegypti mosquito that carries Zika is native to Texas and it also transmits West Nile, dengue, and chikungunya viruses. This type of mosquito, an aggressive daytime biter, often thrives near populated areas. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter."
Health Insurers Plan Rate Hikes for Obamacare Exchanges - Breitbart,Breitbart,Sean Moran,6/16/2017,"Several health insurers will raise premiums by roughly 20 percent on plans sold through Obamacare exchanges. [The biggest Obamacare rate hikes will take place in Delaware, Virginia, and Maryland, which will ask for premiums on average higher than 30 percent in 2018. In Maryland, the average premium from CareFirst will rise by at least 50 percent. Oregon, North Carolina, and Maine health insurers will raise premiums by 20 percent or higher.  The health insurers rate hikes reflect the continuing collapse of Obamacare, as many state Obamacare exchanges continue to experience insurers exiting the Obamacare exchanges. Insurers also remain concerned about President Donald Trumps potential decision to discontinue subsidies for health insurers to lower the cost of premiums. Conservatives argue that the Obamacare subsidies amount to handouts to large health conglomerates. Rick Notter, an executive at Blue Cross Blue Shield Michigan, said, Its still a very volatile market. There are so many uncertainties.  Notter argues that the individual health care market continues to experience turbulence through the uncertainty that comes out of D. C. Republicans, who passed a health care bill through the House, point to insurers rate hikes and withdrawals from Obamacare exchanges as fundamental problems with the Affordable Care Act. The laws of economics were in place long before today. These companies were losing hundreds of millions of dollars, a White House official said. Sen. Tim Kaine ( ) argues that Republicans attempt to repeal Obamacare, as well as President Trumps threat to remove subsidies to health insurers, created the health insurance rate hikes. Kaine said, These actions, these statements, these inactions, this uncertainty, has created a huge set of chaos in the individual marketplace leading to instability for insurance carriers, higher premiums, and reduced competition.  Kevin Lewis, the chief executive at Maine Community Health Options, said that its 19. 6 percent increase in 2018 arises from healthy people exiting the Obamacare markets. Its the classic case of people who are healthier jumping out of the market, Lewis said. Its a bit of a   prophecy.  President Donald Trump, citing that two million Americans have withdrawn from their Obamacare plans since signing up in January, declared that Obamacare is in a  .  2 million more people just dropped out of ObamaCare. It is in a death spiral. Obstructionist Democrats gave up, have no answer = resist!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2017,"
"Amazons Ambitions Unboxed: Stores for Furniture, Appliances and More - The New York Times",New York Times,Nick Wingfield,6/16/2017,"SEATTLE     Last Sunday in Palm Springs, Calif. Jeffrey P. Bezos, the chief executive of Amazon, climbed into the cockpit of a   robot and began flailing his arms as though warming up for a workout, causing the robots enormous appendages to mimic his movements. Why do I feel so much like Sigourney Weaver? Mr. Bezos said, referring to the actress who wore a mechanical suit in a climactic battle in the 1986 movie Aliens.  The intimate audience of entrepreneurs and academics, attending an Amazon conference on robotics and artificial intelligence, chuckled. Later, Mr. Bezos posted a photo on Twitter of himself in the suit with a more menacing air, the robots arms raised as if about to deliver a   bear hug. For years, retailers have been haunted by the thought of Amazon using its technological prowess to squeeze them into powder. That battle has mostly played out on Amazons home turf, the world of online shopping. Now the fight is coming directly to retailers on actual streets around the globe, where Amazon is slowly building a fleet of physical stores. And while most of the attention has been focused on Amazons grocery store dreams, the company has a more ambitious collection of experiments underway. If those experiments work     and there is no guarantee of that     they could have a profound influence on how other stores operate. Over time, they could also introduce new forms of automation, putting traditional retail jobs in jeopardy. At the same time, locating those stores close to customers homes could also help Amazon further its ambitions of delivering internet orders within hours. The company is exploring the idea of creating stores to sell furniture and home appliances, like refrigerators     the kinds of products that shoppers are reluctant to buy over the internet sight unseen, said one of several people with knowledge of the discussions who, in conversations with The New York Times, spoke on condition of anonymity because the plans were confidential. The stores would serve as showcases where people could view the items in person, with orders being delivered to their homes. These would not be your average Home Depots: Amazon has considered using forms of augmented or virtual reality to allow people to see how couches, stoves and credenzas will look in their homes, the person briefed on the discussions said. Amazon is also kicking around an   concept similar to Apples retail emporiums, according to two of the people familiar with the discussions. These shops would have a heavy emphasis on Amazon devices and services such as the companys Echo smart home speaker and Prime Video streaming service. And in groceries     a giant category in which Amazon has struggled     the company has opened a convenience store that does not need cashiers, and it is close to opening two stores where drivers can quickly pick up groceries without leaving their cars, all in Seattle. It has explored another grocery store concept that could serve   customers and act as a hub for home deliveries. Overseas, Amazon is quietly targeting India for new    grocery stores. It is a vast market, and one still largely dominated by traditional street bazaars where shoppers must wander from stall to stall haggling over prices and deliberating over unrefrigerated meat sitting in the dusty open air. Amazons internal code name for its India grocery ambitions: Project Everest. Last week, Amazon opened its fifth physical book store in Chicago, and it has five more announced locations under construction. It is possible that some of the store ideas will never see the light of day. Groups within Amazon are often encouraged to come up with zany initiatives (this is the company that popularized the idea of drone deliveries). Many ideas are chucked after deeper scrutiny by executives. Amazon declined to talk about any stores it has not announced publicly. We are always thinking about new ways to serve customers, but thinking is different than planning, said Drew Herdener, an Amazon spokesman. Since the late 90s, pundits have asked when Amazon     the company Mr. Bezos founded on the premise that people would rather shop from the comfort of their screens     would finally start building stores. But Amazon executives saw plenty of opportunities in online retail and new ways to reach people, from creating digital   devices like Kindle to building up the Prime membership service for getting faster deliveries and other benefits. In 2012, Mr. Bezos told the television interviewer Charlie Rose that shoppers were already well served by existing retailers and that Amazon had no interest in a   effort. We want to do something uniquely Amazon, he said. If we can find that idea, and we havent found it yet, but if we can find that idea, we would love to open physical stores.  Despite Amazons internet retailing success, over time it has become clear that there is a lot of shopping that people prefer to do in person. The most glaring example is groceries     the mother of all shopping categories, with about $770 billion for the supermarkets represented by the Food Marketing Institute, a nonprofit group that includes the majority of such stores in the United States. After pouring resources into an online grocery service, AmazonFresh, for almost a decade, the company has made only modest progress. According to people familiar with the workings of the companys grocery business, it has struggled to operate it profitably, leading to a slow rollout of the service in new locations. One big desire many customers have is that they want to see fresh fruits, vegetables and meat in person before buying them. The relatively high cost of home delivery     Amazon charges $15 a month for its Fresh service, on top of a $99 annual Prime membership     is another barrier. Online grocery delivery accounts for only about 3 percent of the market in the United States, though it is closer to 10 percent in Britain, said Randy Burt, a partner in the food and beverage practice of A. T. Kearney, a strategy and management consulting firm. Mr. Burt said Amazons growing interest in stores mirrored the conclusion that other online merchants with physical stores     the apparel seller Bonobos and the eyewear seller Warby Parker     had come to. I think they are recognizing, for certain things you cant digitize and replicate online all the experience one has in a store, Mr. Burt said. The ability to create experiences is going to be critical for them to continue to get share.  Joe Thompson, a former general manager in Amazons retail business, sees physical retail as key to Mr. Bezoss outsize ambitions for the company. I cant help but feel that, in Bezoss mind, he wants to be the first   valuation company, said Mr. Thompson, who is now an executive at BuildDirect, an online home improvement store. To do that, he said, Amazon would have to crack a couple of completely underpenetrated markets online.  Amazons current market value is bobbing around $400 billion. In the coming weeks, Amazon is expected to open its first two grocery pickup stores, in Seattles Ballard and SoDo neighborhoods, which will allow customers to order food online and schedule brief windows for picking them up in person. Recently, as cars ripped by, workers hung a sign on the exterior of one of the stores     to be called AmazonFresh Pickup, according to city permit documents obtained by GeekWire     before quickly covering it up. A growing number of established grocery retailers are experimenting with this click and collect approach to shopping, including Walmart, Kroger and others. According to one person briefed on Amazons plans, the company has been developing technology for automatically detecting when a customer pulls into the parking lot so orders can be brought to them more quickly. A few miles away from its other Seattle stores, on the ground floor of one of its many office towers in the city, the company is testing Amazon Go, a convenience store concept stocked with beverages, sandwiches and prepared meals, which are put together by chefs in a kitchen that is visible from the street. The retail industry has been captivated by Amazon Gos technology since the company unveiled the store late last year. The store uses a combination of sensors and artificial intelligence to automatically detect the food items shoppers remove from shelves, so they can leave the store without visiting a cashier     the way customers do when they bolt from an Uber. Amazon is wonderful at frictionless commerce, said Timothy Laseter, a professor at the University of Virginias Darden School of Business. There have been glitches with the technology that Amazon engineers continue to work on, according to a person familiar with the operations. For now, only Amazon employees are allowed to use the store. Amazon previously said it would open Amazon Go to the public in early 2017. If Amazon is successful at automating the checkout process, the   implications for employment could be   because other retailers would probably do everything possible to copy it. More than 3. 4 million people are employed as cashiers in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Amazon Go technologies like artificial intelligence are Latin for fire cashiers, said Scott Galloway, a professor of marketing at New York Universitys Leonard N. Stern School of Business. Ive probably been in 30 boardrooms of retailers in the past year, Mr. Galloway said. I would say the No. 1 topic of conversation is Amazon.  For months, reports have circulated that Amazon was considering a concept for a larger grocery store that would combine shopping formats like traditional   purchases,    and home delivery. One of those articles, a February piece by The New York Post, described a futuristic Amazon grocery store staffed by robots, requiring only three human workers. That was too much, apparently, for Mr. Bezos, who became uncharacteristically feisty on Twitter, attacking the article by saying The Posts sources had mixed up their meds.  But a group within Amazon has explored another larger grocery store format, according to both a person familiar with the concept and to internal Amazon documents reviewed by The New York Times. The store could stock fresh produce, meats and other items in a public area of the store, while keeping frozen foods, cereals and other items traditionally found in the center of a grocery store behind a wall, in what would be a kind of small Amazon warehouse. Workers behind the wall, not robots, could quickly package orders for customers. The idea resembles a concept laid out in a paper, A Beautiful Way to Save Woolworths, written by the retail industry consultant Brittain Ladd, who was later hired by Amazon. The status of that project at Amazon is unclear: One person said it never advanced far and was effectively dead, and another disputed that characterization. While Mr. Bezos was known for coining the motto Get Big Fast in the early days of Amazon, the companys plans in physical retail could be better described as Get Big Slow.  Some reports have said Amazon has discussed building up to 2, 000 grocery stores. But that figure was floated mainly as a hypothetical to consider the impact on Amazons supply chain, not as a goal that was under serious consideration, a person familiar with the discussions said. In addition to the two soon to open in Seattle, as many as five more AmazonFresh Pickup locations could open by next year, and the company hopes to expand Amazon Go to Britain and several cities in the United States in the same time frame, this person said. India could represent another big market for Amazon in physical retail. The company, which has vowed to spend billions of dollars on its efforts in the worlds   populous country, recently sought approval from the Indian government to open online and physical food stores in the country, The Economic Times reported in February. According to a person familiar with Amazons India grocery efforts, the company hopes to open its first Indian grocery store in Bangalore. In a statement, Amazon said the company was excited by the Indian governments efforts to encourage foreign investment in a stronger food supply chain.  We have sought an approval to invest and partner with the government in achieving this vision, Amazon said. For Mr. Galloway at N. Y. U. the slow pace of Amazons rollout of stores is a sign that it has not figured out physical retail yet, and that has surprised him. Five years ago, he believed Amazon would have hundreds of stores by this time. What appears to be clear is they havent yet zeroed in on a format theyre willing to massively scale, he said. This is a company that the moment it figures out something that works, it puts nuclear energy behind it."
Kremlin Makes Dubious Claim It Killed Islamic State Chief al-Baghdadi - Breitbart,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/16/2017,"Russia may have executed the ruthless and elusive leader of the Islamic State ( ) terrorist group Abu Bakr   in Syria back in May, the Kremlins military claimed in a far from definitive statement. [A May 28 airstrike on a suburban Raqqa, Syria, command post killed as up to 30 leaders and 300 troops in the militant group also identified as Daesh, ISIS, and ISIL. Reclusive leader Abu Bakr   was present and was eliminated in the strike, the ministry said, reports United Press International (UPI).  According to information, which we are checking through various channels, at the meeting was also present the leader of ISIS who as a result of the strike was destroyed. The American side was informed about the time and place of the Russian aviation through the channels of cooperation, the Russian ministry declared in its statement, according to ABC News. Nevertheless, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, only hours after the defense ministrys claim surfaced, said he does not have 100 percent confirmation that Baghdadi has died. There have been multiple reports erroneously claiming Baghdadi has been wounded and even killed, but the Kremlins military statement marks the first time Russia acknowledged it might have executed the war criminal. Prior to the recent allegations by the Russian military that the ISIS chief may be dead, unconfirmed news claimed that Baghdadi, whose exact whereabouts remained unknown for long, had been seriously wounded when airstrikes targeted a senior leadership meeting he chaired near the borders with Syria, noted Iraqi News. Moreover, the West and Iraq are skeptical about Moscows claim that it has taken out Baghdadi, points out Reuters. We cant confirm these reports at this time, said Col. Ryan Dillon, the spokesman for the   U. S.  coalition, which maintains communications with Russia. We have no information to corroborate those reports, reiterated U. S. Navy Captain Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. His death has been reported so often that you have to be cautious till a formal Daesh [ISIS] statement comes, an unnamed European security official told Reuters. Pentagon officials say there are no indications of any chatter within the ranks of ISIS that Baghdadi has been killed or wounded, revealed Ret. Marine Col. Steve Ganyard who once served as a former deputy assistant secretary of state, according to ABC News. Theres nothing to back it up, no intelligence to back it up. So we need to remain very, very suspect of this claim, added the retired Marine. The Russians claimed that they killed the ISIS chief on the outskirts of Raqqa, the jihadist groups de facto capital of Syria. Raqqa is under siege by dictator Bashar  s Syrian military, supported by Russian airpower and   Shiite militias, including the   group Hezbollah, as well as the U. S. armed forces and their allies. That makes it difficult to know for certain whether the worlds most wanted terrorist has in fact fallen. Raqqa is a city under siege, so the Russians have no hard evidence. Theres no DNA evidence that would suggest that hes dead, noted Col. Ganyard. However, Baghdadi this year reportedly disseminated a farewell speech to his subordinates, followers, and sympathizers in Mosul, ISISs last major stronghold in Iraq where U.  locals are believed to be close to victory     pushing the terrorist group out. Echoing the commander of Iraqs Federal Police, Baghdadi admitted defeat in Mosul and revealed that   ISIS officers, apparently including him, had fled to Syria. The speech directed its combatants to disguise and escape to the mountainous areas of Iraq and Syria, reported     News. Prior to the recent allegations by the Russian military that the ISIS chief may be dead, unconfirmed news claimed that Baghdadi, whose exact whereabouts remained unknown for long, had been seriously wounded when airstrikes targeted a senior leadership meeting he chaired near the borders with Syria, notes Iraqi News."
"University of Wisconsin Anti-Capitalism Professor Earns $170,000 Annually - Breitbart",Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/16/2017,"Recently published information reveals that Erik Olin Wright, a professor who teaches a course bashing capitalism at the University of Wisconsin, earns an annual salary of $170, 000. [A syllabus for Professor Wrights class, entitled Class, State, and Ideology: An Introduction to Social Science in the Marxist Tradition, was published only by the free   MacIver Institute.  The syllabus claims that the course covers the Marxist tradition and its radical critics of capitalism as an economic system and social order.  Wright argues that a study of the Marxist tradition gives students the tools to understand the radical egalitarian project of social change.  Wright, a tenured professor at the University of Wisconsins Sociology Department, makes $116, 111 more than the average household income in Wisconsin. His $170, 000 annually salary also places him in the top two percent of all Americans. Wright has written extensively on radical democratic egalitarianism, and believes that the inequities by a capitalist economic and social order perpetuates eliminable forms of human suffering.  It is unclear if Wright believes his membership in the top two percent of American income earners makes him a willing participant in the nations capitalistic economic order that causes human suffering.

7 Castro Victims and Cuban Heroes Invited to Trumps Cuba Announcement - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/16/2017,"President Trumps announcement of policy revisions toward Cuba     in which many strings on the Castro regime loosened by President Barack Obama were tightened again     was attended by a number of notable Cuban dissidents and victims of Castro violence. [Mario and Miriam de la Pena: Their son Mario Manuel de la Pena was murdered by the Castro regime in 1996 at the age of 25, while serving as a volunteer pilot for the humanitarian operation Brothers to the Rescue. He flew almost a hundred    missions before his plane and another Brothers to the Rescue aircraft were shot down by a Cuban   over international waters, killing three U. S. citizens and one legal resident of the United States.   The unprovoked attack on two unarmed,   planes was a blatant crime against humanity and violation of American law. The shootdown was condemned by both the United Nations Security Council and the U. N. Commission on Human Rights. A Cuban spy named Gerardo Hernandez was convicted in U. S. court of tipping off the Castro regime to the flight plans of Brothers to the Rescue planes. Hernandez served 16 years in prison before being released by Barack Obama and returned to Cuba, where he was hailed as a hero and decorated with a medal. Mirta Costa Mendez: Her brother Carlos Costa was another victim of the Brothers to the Rescue shootdown. Costa was 29 years old at the time of his death. He was Brothers to the Rescue 24 hours a day, his father said. His greatest wish was to save lives.  Antonio G. Rodiles: A Cuban dissident who often visits Miami to work with dissident groups based there, Rodiles was an outspoken critic of Obamas policy and very energetic in calling upon Trump to erase it. We have direct experience, including talking to President Obama, and the direct experience was that there was a lot of indolence in what happened with Cuba, Rodiles said in March. There was a moment when we understood that the administration was not an ally for democratic changes in Cuba, that they had a vision that Cuba was going to change in the long term and that we would have to accept  .  His advice for the Trump administration to recognize that they are dealing with a dictatorship appears to have been heeded. Many, many people are telling me that we have to squeeze the government once and for all. And many people I meet in the street have much tougher opinions than mine, Rodiles said of his experiences in Cuba while preparing for Trumps announcement Friday. Rosa Maria Paya: Her father Oswaldo Paya was a moderate but determined Cuban democracy activist who was murdered by the Castro regime in 2012. Coercive police state tactics were employed against the surviving witnesses to the vehicular homicide to cover up the crime.  His daughter carried on his work without hesitation. Her activities include calling out the regime for the abuses of power and terror tactics it supposedly abandoned when Obama implemented his liberalized policy. Rosa Maria has been subjected to some police harassment herself, and not just by Cuban police. She says she was subjected to unusual scrutiny and then threatened with deportation to Cuba by Panamanian police in 2015 because they feared she would cause a riot at the Summit of the Americas, which Cuba wanted to keep free of Cuban dissidents. The Panamanian government later apologized to her for what it called a bureaucratic mistake.  Sylvia Iriondo: The president of a group called Mothers and Women Against Repression, Iriondo was incensed at claims by   supporters of Obamas policy that Cuba had changed and should be supported for liberalizing. With all due respect, where have they been these past 56 years? If they are part of our community, they must have felt the pain of thousands of Cubans who were victims of arbitrary human rights violations by a regime intent on maintaining its grip on power via repression and terror, she wrote at the Miami Herald in December 2015. She wondered how any member of the   community could fail to see that the Castro regime was still killing its opponents, driving families to escape the island, and using totalitarian tactics to retain power. These gentlemen are not my fellow Cuban Americans, she declared. Iriondo was angered by the way President Obamas supporters were ready to forget about all those who have given their lives for freedom or have died in the pursuit of freedom, as she said at an event commemorating the Castro regimes victims. Luis Haza: Born in Cuba, violinist Luis Haza was a child prodigy who began performing at the age of 11. His father was murdered by Fidel Castro when he was a child for the crime of supporting democracy and the mistake of thinking Castro would deliver it. He refused international scholarship offers to study with some of the worlds greatest violinists, telling a Cuban official: No, but if you send me to the United States, I will go.  His family eventually fled Cuba for Spain, and then came to America. I had so much emotion pent up that music became my obsession. Since I could not express my feelings verbally, violin became my way of expression, he said in a 2003 interview. He is now able to express those feelings verbally, musically, and through tireless education and activism in the cause of freedom. As President Trump said during his introduction of Haza in Miami on Friday, he was forced at gunpoint to play music after refusing to participate in a command performance for Raul Castro, so he played the American national anthem, which he also performed before Trumps address. You could hear a pin drop. I finished playing, and nobody knew what to do, he said of that boyhood act of defiance against Castros evil.  Jorge Luis Garcia Perez and Bertha Antunez: Jorge Luis Garcia Perez, who often goes by the name Antunez, was arrested in 1990 at the age of 24 for protesting the Castro regime and its discrimination against the   minority. His   sentence ended up lasting for 17 years, thanks to such acts of defiance as refusing to attend   sessions. He wrote that like many young Cubans, I have wasted my best years in prison, charged with the sole crime of not sharing the governments ideology.  His sister Bertha Antunez strenuously objected to President Obamas normalization of relations with Cuba, signing an open letter calling it little more than a string of unilateral concessions to a totalitarian dictatorship that has tirelessly repressed the Cuban people for the past 56 years.  This has been a year of repression and jailings in Cuba, she said in 2015. The repression has increased in Cuba because the government believes that it can repress anytime and nothing happens. On the contrary, they have recognized us as a legitimate government.  Bertha Antunez was chosen to collect an award from the National Endowment for Democracy on behalf of a group of Cuban dissidents, including her father, in 2009. President Obama did not meet with her or issue a message of support to the group she represented, despite two weeks advance notice. The Obama White House responded to media inquiries about the snub by claiming it was a clerical error."
Rasmussen Tracking Poll: Donald Trump Reaches 50 Percent Approval,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/16/2017,"President Donald Trumps approval numbers are ticking up after taking a hit from news of the ongoing Russia investigation and media outcry. [Fridays Rasmussen Reports: Daily Presidential Tracking Poll shows that 50 percent of likely voters now approve of President Trumps performance in office.  The presidents approval numbers are moving back up after they fell to a low of 42 percent in April. He took office in January with a high of 59 percent.

"Trump Drops Truth Bombs on Cuba Regime, Policies - Breitbart",Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/16/2017,"President Donald Trump offered the most forthright criticism of Cuba since John F. Kennedy when he addressed a crowd in Miami ahead of signing an executive order reversing the Obama administrations policy of normalization. [In a speech frequently interrupted by applause, and by cameo appearances from   activists, Trump laid out a moral case against the Castro regime and its policies that few previous presidents have dared to make.  We will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer, Trump said. He laid out his principles and policies, including regime change: With Gods help, a free Cuba is what we will soon achieve, he said, to sustained cheers and chants of   ! He listed some of the human rights abuses of the Castro regime, acknowledging those in the audience who had suffered the true and brutal nature of the Castro regime        many of you witnessed terrible crimes committed in service of a depraved ideology.  He mentioned activists in Cuba who were prevented from leaving to attend his speech. He saluted exiles and dissidents present, some of whom had suffered decades of imprisonment in Cuba. Trump declared defiantly     in a swipe at his predecessor: Now that I am president, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime and stand with the Cuban people in their struggle for freedom. Because we know it is best for America to have freedom in our hemisphere, whether in Cuba or Venezuela, and to have a future where the people of each country can live out their own dreams, he said. He added: For nearly six decades, the Cuban people have suffered under communist domination. To this day, Cuba is ruled by the same people who killed tens of thousands of their own citizens, who sought to spread their repressive and failed ideology throughout our hemisphere, and who once tried to host enemy nuclear weapons ninety miles from our shores. The Castro regime has shipped arms to North Korea, and fueled chaos in Venezuela. While imprisoning innocents, it has harbored cop killers, hijackers, and terrorists. It has supported human trafficking, forced labor, and exploitation all around the globe. This is the simple truth of the Castro regime. My administration will not hide from it, excuse it, or glamorize it. And we will never, ever be blind to it. We know whats going on, and we remember what happened. And he declared: The previous administrations easing of restrictions on travel and trade does not help the Cuban people. They only enrich the Cuban regime. The profits from investment and tourism flow directly to the [Cuban] military. The regime takes the money and owns the industry. The outcome of [the] last administrations executive action has been only more repression, and a move to crush the peaceful, democratic movement. He later laid out conditions for a new agreement to improve relations, including dramatic improvements in Cubas human rights policies, the holding of free elections supervised by international observers, and the return of the cop killer, Joanne Chesimard.  (The latter is known as Assata Shakur and is still lionized by the American left.) It was all too much for at least one Obama administration adviser. As Trump spoke, former Obama White House official Ben Rhodes, one of the main architects of normalization with Cuba, tweeted furiously in opposition. He declared: Trump doesnt care about the human rights of the Cuban people and his policies will do nothing to help them.  Rhodes also challenged the   in the audience: The few people in Miami enabling Trump in carrying out this charade should be   held accountable. He could care less about Cubans, he tweeted. Its tragic that some people in Fla are so determined to cling to a failed hardline on Cuba that theyre hitching themselves to Donald Trump, he later added. Trump left the door open to diplomacy, stating that his new policy will maintain the U. S. embassy in Havana: Our embassy [in Cuba] remains open in the hope that our countries can forge a stronger and much better path, he said. We will respect Cuban sovereignty, but we will never turn our backs on the Cuban people, he later added. Trump left no doubt that relations would henceforth have to be based on a foundation of truth     not lenience toward a regime that secured   concessions from the Obama administration without any domestic political change.

Trump goes after Crooked H Clinton and Dems dealings with Russia as special counsel probe expands,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/16/2017,"President Donald Trump asked Thursday on Twitter why   investigators were not looking at Hillary Clintons family and   Democrats dealings with Russia, instead examining his    .     Trumps tweets came  that special counsel Robert Muellers   investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election has   now expanded to include a probe into whether Trump committed   obstruction of justice with his firing of former FBI Director   James Comey last month.     Mueller is also reportedly investigating whether Trump associates   committed financial crimes.     Trump, who tweeted earlier Thursday that the investigation was   the single greatest WITCH HUNT in US political history and is   being led by some very bad and conflicted people, tried to turn   the conversation to the 2016 Democratic presidential   nominee, Hillary Clinton.

Paul Nehlen Launches Another Bid Against Anti-Trump Speaker Paul Ryan - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,6/16/2017,"Paul Nehlen, a Republican businessman from Wisconsins first congressional district, has just launched his 2018 congressional campaign against the   Trump House Speaker Paul Ryan. [This is the second time Nehlen is challenging Ryan, after coming up short in the 2016 GOP primary in Wisconsins first congressional district.  Speaker Ryan didnt help Mr. Trump defeat Hillary Clinton, and even pledged not to defend the president, Nehlen said in his announcement. But I have a message for Speaker Ryan: The American people are not done fighting for President Trumps good agenda. Thats why I am announcing my second challenge to Paul Ryan for the nomination in Wisconsins first congressional district.  Nehlens comment refers to audio unearthed by Breitbart News of Ryan during a conference call with House GOP members in which he not only abandoned   Donald Trump during the most crucial month of October of the 2016 presidential campaign but pledged to never defend the president again. I am not going to defend Donald Trump   not now, not in the future, Ryan said in the audio of the conference call with House GOP colleagues, which came after the Access Hollywood tape of Trump emerged. Ryans comments were notable because he did not say he specifically would not defend Trump on the Access Hollywood tape. His comments meant he would not defend the man who is now president of the United States on anything. Ryan refused to campaign with President Trump at all until the end of the campaign, but did appear with   President Mike Pence. At the time, Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said things have changed since Trump won the election. The world is well aware of this history, Buck said of the audio tape of Ryan throwing Trump under the bus. And obviously a lot has happened since then. As everyone knows, Buck also said, adding in a third comment that of course they were when asked if these comments were specifically about the Access Hollywood tapes, even though Ryan did not qualify his abandonment of Trump in the conference call. This was in response to that, but as everyone knows, they came together toward the end of the campaign and the Speaker vocally supported him and even campaigned with Pence, Buck said. Buck has not responded to a request for comment in response to Nehlens announcement he is running again against Ryan. But Nehlen appears to be coming straight at Ryan out of the gate, more than a year before the primary against Ryan. That extra time will give Nehlen an ability to build his name ID in the district, fundraise, and gain steam against the Speaker of the House. Nehlen continued in his statement. Last year in my first challenge to Speaker Ryan, we managed to kill Ryans and Obamas   deal, the   Partnership. But Paul Ryan apparently hasnt gotten the memo. Millions of Americans voted for President Trump, and they expect Paul Ryan to work to repeal Obamacare end bad,   trade deals close the border and back the Presidents strong, America First agenda. But that hasnt happened. But unbelievably, Paul Ryan has fully funded the dangerous refugee resettlement racket. That is not what we voted for. Nehlen is correct that he successfully forced Ryan to oppose the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) which President Trump has since gone on to officially kill once and for all. He also forced Ryan to campaign on bended knee in front of actual factory workers in Wisconsin. But he did come up short, winning less than 20 percent of the vote in the primary against Ryan. Nehlen concluded in his Friday statement by saying that Ryan is a career politician who must be drained from the swamp of Washington, D. C. Nehlen said: Paul Ryan is a career politician who has been in D. C. for nearly two decades. He may have been a nice Wisconsin boy when he left Janesville, but now Ryan is working for special interests and industry bosses, working to sell Wisconsins jobs to Mexico and Asia. Ryan is working    with multinational corporations to reduce their costs by giving them access to   immigrant labor. And it is decimating WIsconsins economy. Wisconsin voted to drain the swamp last November, so thats what Im going to do. During the primary last year, Trump   then officially the GOP nominee for President   Tweeted out support for Nehlen. After significant backlash in the media and inside the Republican Party, Trump eventually officially endorsed Ryan for Congress in the name of GOP unity   something Ryan, of course, reneged on in October. But Trumps endorsement, which he famously read off a piece of paper, was viewed as a hollow one by many hardcore Trump supporters, almost as though he had to do it. Trump went on to win Wisconsin in the general election   adding the rust belt state and its 10 electoral votes to others like Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, and Michigan to his win total, carrying him into the White House   without Ryans support. Now, according to some polls, Trump is more popular in Ryans own district than Ryan   something Nehlen will surely be banking on in the 2018 primary campaign hes running against Ryan."

"Watch: Alex Marlow Talks Media, Free Speech, and Rhetoric with Bill Maher - Breitbart",Breitbart,Breitbart TV,6/16/2017,"On Fridays Real Time with Bill Maher on HBO, host and comedian Bill Maher interviewed Breitbart News    Alex Marlow.  The two discussed Breitbarts coverage, the media, Russia, free speech, the shooting at a congressional baseball practice, and political rhetoric. Marlow said that Breitbart is not going to cover the exact same stories the exact same way as all the other outlets. Well leave that to the rest of the establishment press. Were very much   trying to highlight stories that we dont think get their fair day.  After the discussion turned to Russia, Marlow stated that there was no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice, adding, You guys continue to talk about this story in the establishment press instead of talking about the presidents agenda, which is by design. Because you guys wont apologize if it turns out theres nothing, no one will come out on MSNBC, theyll just move on to the next hysteria, and thats a huge advantage for people like me who are covering the rest of the news.  Marlow later said, I love highlighting Muslim voices who are progressive and reformist and want to take out some of the misogyny and some of the hatred associated with radical elements of it. And I think thats an important place to start, but to bring back what Breitbart does different than anyone else, is we cover stories the establishment press doesnt want to cover.  On free speech, Maher and Marlow agreed that if the depictions of the assassination of President Trump were of President Obama, the reaction on the left would be different. Maher then raised corporations pulling ads from people who engage in speech they do not like. Marlow said, This really started   in my view   in the modern era, with Breitbart   where a lot of people are boycotting Breitbart. And what theyre doing is, theres a lot of anonymous people online, cowardly people. We dont know whos funding them. We dont know who they are, who are putting out all of this misinformation about who we are and what we stand for, and theyre trying to round up corporations to boycott us. And so, whats happened is that corporations are now deciding whats free and fair speech, who can make a living, what opinions you can make a living saying now, and, of course, now, youre seeing the right fight fire with fire and want boycotts of when the left takes it too far in their Trump hatred. So its a very dangerous path were on, and I really do think, Bill, and I appreciate you giving me this opportunity, people on the left and the right who are free speech advocates need to come together right now and say that corporations are not going to define the First Amendment and free speech in this country.  Marlow said that he does not believe Bernie Sanders is at fault for the congressional baseball practice shooting and continued, When you have a climate where you have, CNN, for example, calling Breitbart to the number one platform for the Nazi salute over a video we never played and CNN played, when you have the New York Times accusing Breitbart of putting racist dog whistles out, when the media lies so much about people, calling Trump supporters racists, despicable, deplorable, all of these things over and over       Maher cut in, They have been racist, despicable, and deplorable.  Marlow concluded, I encourage everyone to go to breitbart. . You can meet some of the Breitbart reporters, the Breitbart editors. Theyre the most wonderful, diverse, influential journalists on the planet, and no one is interested in their real story because theyre so quick to call people racist. And its not working. That is why so many Democrats are losing across the country.        And so, if you want to play that game, Bill, if you want to keep calling us racists, I dont think its going to work for you, so please, have at it.  Follow Breitbart. tv on Twitter @BreitbartVideo."

Acosta said Trump is ushering in a cold war     a return to the cold war between Washington and Havana. He made that very clear in this speech, going after the Castro government time and again, accusing the government in Havana of jailing political prisoners, of rounding up innocent people, putting them behind bars purely for political reasons. He talked about firing squads at one point, the sounds of gunshots in the air and the ocean breeze in Havana. That is the kind of cold war rhetoric that we have heard for decades between the United States and Cuba.  (  Mediaite) Follow Ian Hanchett on Twitter @IanHanchett"
Erdogan Condemns U.S. for Bodyguard Warrants over May Beating: What Kind of Law Is This? - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/16/2017,"In remarks from Ankara on Thursday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was harshly critical of the U. S. arrest warrants for twelve of his bodyguards. [What kind of law is this? If my bodyguards cannot protect me then why am I bringing them to America with me? Erdogan exclaimed, as reported by Hurriyet Daily News.  Washington, DC, police issued warrants for the bodyguards on Thursday, at a press conference decorated with photos of the men stamped WANTED in red. The charges involve assault against protesters outside the Turkish ambassadors residence in D. C. on May 16, during Erdogans visit to the United States.  We all saw the violence that was perpetrated against peaceful protesters, and its not something that were going to tolerate, said D. C. Police Chief Peter Newsham. He added that the suspects are all believed to have returned to Turkey and are thus unlikely to land in an American courtroom unless they surrender themselves, but he stated they would be arrested if the ever return to the United States. The U. S. State Department has not ruled out demanding their extradition. In his remarks, Erdogan claimed the protesters were all affiliated with the violent separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) and the Fethullah Terrorist Organization (FETO) which is the Turkish governments name for the followers of exiled cleric Fethullah Gulen, currently a resident of Pennsylvania. The Turkish government insists Gulen is the mastermind behind last years unsuccessful coup attempt against Erdogan. The U. S. police did nothing. Can you imagine what the response would have been if a similar incident had taken place in Turkey? Erdogan asked, insinuating that the protesters were a threat to his safety. Its something of a trick question because it is not very difficult to imagine how Erdogans security forces would respond to a protest by suspected PKK and FETO members that got within 50 feet him. Turkeys Foreign Ministry summoned U. S. Ambassador John Bass on Thursday to declare the arrest warrants against Erdogans bodyguards unacceptable.  The statement repeated Erdogans allegations that local security authorities were at fault. This incident would not have occurred if the US authorities had taken the usual measures they take in similar   visits and therefore that Turkish citizens cannot be held responsible for the incident that took place, the Foreign Ministry said. The UK Guardian quotes Center for Strategic and International Studies analyst Bulent Aliriza, who stressed the Turks are very serious about the matter and worried the U. S. relationship with Turkey could suffer significant damage if the warrants are allowed to stand. There will be demands for action that may ultimately damage the diplomatic relationship to the point of ambassadors being yanked back, which is unprecedented, Aliriza said."
"In Miami, Trump Applauds Cuban Victims of Communism: Now We Hold the Cards - Breitbart",Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/16/2017,"In Miami, the heart of Americas Cuban exile community, President Donald Trump sounded the death knell of predecessor Barack Obamas normalization policy towards Cuba, vowing, we will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer. [Opening with a recognition of recent victims of leftist violence     U. S. citizen Otto Warmbier, recently released by Cuba ally North Korea, and Representative Steve Scalise ( )     Trump called for the audience to pray for them and all the American and Cuban people. He then listed some of the Cuban dissidents present for his speech in Florida, including Jorge Luis Garca Prez (Antnez) who suffered 17 years in prison for objecting to communism, and Cary Roque, a dissident who Trump allowed to deliver a few short words.  Trump also took a moment to acknowledge two dissidents not present in Miami     Jos Daniel Ferrer of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) and Berta Soler of the Ladies in White     who were banned from traveling to the event by the communist regime. The president honored  the great people who fought at Bay of Pigs, the 2506 Brigade veterans present at the event, and the children of Operation Peter Pan.  We want to thank you all for being a voice for the voiceless, Trump concluded. The exiles and dissidents here today have witnessed communism destroy a nation, just as communism has destroyed every nation where it has ever been tried.  Trump listed those crimes in detail. You look at what happened and what communism has done, he listed. Believers persecuted for preaching the word of God, you watch the Women in White     bruised, bloodied, and captured on their way from Mass, you have heard the chilling cries of loved ones or the cracks of firing squads piercing through the ocean breeze     not a good sound.  This is the simple truth of the Castro regime: my administration will not hide from it, excuse it, or glamorize it, and we will never, ever be blind to it. We know what is going on and we remember what happened, Trump promised. Last year, I promised to be a voice against repression. You went out and you voted, and here I am, the president told the audience. Now that I am president, America will expose the crimes of the Castro regime       now we hold the cards.  Those cards, the president promised, would be used to pressure a regime that harbors cop killers, hijackers, and terrorists, and has shipped arms to North Korea and fueled chaos in Venezuela.  Trumps new policy, signed shortly after the speech, would enforce the ban on tourism, enforce the embargo       take concrete steps that ensure investments float directly to the people so they can open private businesses and begin to build their countrys future, according to the president. The new policies, Trump continued, would require Cuba to put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard before America would be open to a deal with them. In another nod to the   community, Trump acknowledged the murder of U. S. citizens in the 1996 Brothers to the Rescue incident. With their family in attendance, he promised them, they did not die in vain.  We challenge Cuba to come to the table with a new agreement that is in the best interests of both their people and our people, and also for Cuban Americans, Trump concluded, before sitting down to sign the new policies into action. The new policies followed a thorough White House review of President Obamas normalization shift, as well as consultations with Cuban policy experts in Congress, including members of the Cuban exile community who were present at Fridays event, like Rep. Mario   ( ) and Senator Marco Rubio ( ). In anticipation of the announcement, Cuban   dissident leaders praised the changes to American policy, calling them a positive step for the democratization of the island. The White House invited a number of prominent Cuban dissidents to the announcement, including the head of the Ladies in White movement, Berta Soler, who was banned from leaving Cuba to attend. President Trump made reforms to benefit the Cuban people and limit the power of the communist regime a staple of his presidential campaign, earning him the first endorsement from the Bay of Pigs Veterans Association in the history of that group."
These United emails reveal how terrified the airline has become of its customers,Business Insider,Benjamin Zhang,6/16/2017,"In May,  completed the rollout of its new Basic Economy fare class. The   ticket option has been the subject of great controversy since it was announced late last year. Designed to compete against the   product offerings and rock bottom prices of ultra   carriers, the fare was targeted at a very specific group of budget conscious shoppers. In fact,  in an interview earlier this year that Basic Economy is not for everybody and that the airline would even prefer its customers go with the   fare. For those who have fallen in with the Basic Economy crowd, the restrictions are significant. While the   experience is identical to Uniteds regular economy product, Basic Economy passengers cannot   or upgrade their seats, are limited to a single personal item in the cabin, and must be the last to board the aircraft. Due to its notorious limitations, United has made the need to effectively communicate with their passengers a priority. We have a lot of mechanisms to make sure when you buy that ticket you fully well know, you aint getting bags, you aint sitting together with your family, Munoz said in the February interview. We are going follow up. We are going to do all those different things.  Since the interview, however, the need to make sure that everyone traveling in Basic Economy is there on their own volition has been kicked into high gear. On Uniteds part, the level of communication between airline and customer is rather extensive. Prior to purchasing the ticket on Uniteds website, a   window appears explaining the features of Basic Economy. The pop up remains until the customer acknowledges he or she understands the limitations of the fare class. After purchasing the ticket, United will then send out a series of emails reminding passengers that their ticket is indeed a restricted Basic Economy fare, detailing the limitation of the fare class, and finally a reminder that they have 24 hours to ask for a refund. The importance of these emails and reminders have become exponentially more important due to two developments. First, Uniteds public image has taken the beating of a lifetime over the past couple of months. Although much of it is its own doing, no airline in recent memory has had to battle such an unrelenting onslaught of bad press as United has since April. Not even General Motors 27 million car safety recall,  s tire separation crisis, and Volkswagens 11 million car emissions cheating scandal could rival the pop culture and political furor generated by Uniteds treatment of Dr. David Dao. Even though United has worked hard to battle back since the scandal with a host of policy changes and reforms to the way the company treats its customers, their public image is at best on thin ice. This means the last thing the   airline needs is angry parents ranting en masse about not being able to sit with their families or business travelers complaining about being charged an extra fee to   their   bags. This brings us to the second development. Basic Economy has proven to be unexpectedly popular. United Airlines CFO Andrew Levy said this week that 30% to 40% of the airlines economy class passengers have gone the basic route, . Which means the scale of the operation needed to manage Basic Economy has increased dramatically. Sadly, even with the reminders,  that they were either unaware of their tickets limitations or simply didnt know they had purchased basic economy.    In May, United Airlines completed the rollout. .."
"EXCLUSIVE - Trumps Agriculture Secretary Leading 22-Agency Task Force to Reignite Rural America, Protect Forgotten Man - Breitbart",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/16/2017,"In keeping with President Donald Trumps executive order establishing the Interagency Task Force on Agriculture and Rural Prosperity, Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue launched the effort on Thursday along with representatives from 22 federal agencies that are taking on the   initiative. [The task force will work to find ways to increase jobs, housing and educational opportunities for Americas rural communities, and to remove obstacles, such as burdensome regulations, and to improve infrastructure and access to technology.  The task force held its inaugural meeting in Washington, D. C. and attendees included Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Ben Carson, Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget Mick Mulvaney, U. S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission Ajit Pai, and other government officials. What we began here today is to lay a fertile seed bed in rural America, where good things can grow, Perdue said. He went on: Rural America has been struggling under burdensome regulations, but the leaders we gathered today are willing to work together to turn that around. By establishing this task force, President Trump showed his commitment to prioritizing the prosperity of the farmers and ranchers of Americas heartland, as well as all citizens living in rural communities across this great country. Guided by the President at the helm, and with Secretaries Carson and Perry, Director Mulvaney, Trade Representative Lighthizer, and so many others, we are telling rural America that were here, were listening, and were going to help provide you with the resources, tools, and support to build robust, sustainable communities for generations to come. When asked by Breitbart News why Perdues agency is taking the lead on implementing Trumps order, the Secretary said the president knows that rural Americans arent enjoying the same economic uptick that the rest of Americans are enjoying and that rural communities are represented in every state. I think [Trump] saw the USDA and the Secretary of Agriculture as the one to bring these   together, Perdue told Breitbart News. The other thing is, I guess with all those members of Congress, they all have a certain degree of agriculture in their district and they understand the needs of [those communities].  Perdue said. Its the one common denominator I think that unites us in many, many ways across America.  In April 2017, Trump issued an executive order establishing the task force to ensure the informed exercise of regulatory authority that impacts agriculture and rural communities.  Regulations, in fact, were routinely mentioned as something detrimental to rural prosperity, including rules and regulations put into place by the EPA that create obstacles for farming and ranching. The White House laid out the plan this way: While much of the country has recovered from the recent recession, large areas of rural America have not fared as well.  Nationally, 85 percent of persistently impoverished counties are in rural areas, and one in four rural children is growing up in poverty.  The employment numbers continue to lag, and without connectivity and improved infrastructure widely available, the population in rural America is at its lowest point since 2010. The Task Force is working to improve quality of life for people living in rural areas, develop a reliable workforce, spur innovation and technology development, and roll back regulations to allow communities to grow and thrive. By directly engaging stakeholders to develop an action plan for legislative reforms and regulatory relief, the Task Force is expected to accomplish a great deal for rural Americans. President Trump has asked for a report with concrete recommendations within 180 days of the Task Forces creation. Promoting agriculture and rural prosperity is something that is very important to me since I know   how vital energy and electricity are to our rural areas, Perry said of his agencys role in the task force. At the Department of Energy, we are ready to do our part to bring prosperity to our small towns and rural communities. Our Bioenergies Technology Office facilitates private and public partnerships to develop new technologies that make biofuels   and our national labs are hard at work developing new ways to use our crops for energy, Perry said. If youre going to address the needs of rural America, you cant do it one agency at a time, Mulvaney said at the event. Tate Bennett, who represented the EPA at the meeting, said reviewing and reworking the Waters of the United States rule as it relates to the Clean Water Act is a priority for EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt. He wants to hear from the people who are directly impacted by WOTUS, and thats rural America, Bennett said."
"If youre stumped about what sports car to buy, just get a Ford Mustang GT",Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,6/16/2017,"Im often asked by people what car they should buy. The answer isnt necessarily all that easy, because everybody has different needs. Im rarely asked what sports car to buy, though. Most people who want one of those babies have been thinking about something specific for years if not decades. They might have had a Porsche or Ferrari poster on the bedroom wall, and that sealed the deal when they were teenagers. However, in the event that I do encounter somebody who wants   buying advice, I know have a simple, straightforward answer: Get a 2017 Mustang GT convertible with a   manual and a big old   V8. It will set you back less than $50, 000, for a reasonably   example like the test car I recently enjoyed. For three seasons in much of the USA and four in the warmer climates, you will have so much fun with this car that youll be dippy. Mind you, I am by nature a     type of guy. The new Mazda   Miata is my cup of tea and the only proper sports car Ive ever owned (a   model). Moving up the power band, I rather like the Porsche 911 and have no issues with Corvettes.  The   Stang wth that 5.  V8 and an excellent   is just all sweet spot. Theres also a V6 available, a 3.  making 300 horsepower, which would also be okay, if far less stonking, and a 2.  turbocharged   shaves the output down to 285 hp     both come with the   stick standard. The Mustang was completely revamped for its 50th anniversary in 2015. The result was a departure from Stangs of the past in that the new Pony Car was definitely less       and more    . The suspension was upgraded from the reliable old   design, which was great for drag racing but not really up to the task of keeping the car settled through tight maneuvers.  That   vibe has been supplanted by something that has more of a whiff of the European about it, but the core values of the Mustang we all know and love have been deftly preserved. For example, when you put the GT in Sport mode and stomp on the pedal, the front end rises up and the rear end hunkers down. You can literally feel the rear tires gaining purchase in the pavement, digging in as the torque from the V8 is laid in through, for the sake of argument, second gear. Brembos all around keep matters in check.  The symphony of combustion piping out of the motor (nicknamed Coyote) is fairly glorious. Not quite as robust and stirring as what owners of the   Shelby 350 can access via their larger 5.  Voodoo V8. But really, just fine. Its a decently delivered burble and bark, nothing that will scare the neighbors, but enough to hold your attention when merging to the legal speed limit. Fuel economy is what you should expect, which is not that great: 14     combined.  With a   mph time of 4. 3 seconds, you will not want for acceleration. But neither will you have your ears pinned back and your neck whiplashed. The velocity is manageable.  Even better, the convertible GT isnt a ride that you need to take   to have a good time. I drove four adults around (yes, the back seats can handle two of those) my New Jersey town on a warm night in early summer and we kept it around 25 mph the whole time. Essentially, we cruised. And a lovely cruise it was. The GT has all the tech you might want, starting with Fords SYNC 3 infotainment and extending to various   features. But this really isnt a car that needs much more than a good radio to be appealing (SiriusXM is in the house, directed through a   Shaker audio system that does indeed shake). Its a doggone sports car, the opposite of a  . And its a Pony Car to boot. Just slipping in and buckling up is an exercise in nostalgia.  Heres the bottom line. My Mustang GT tester shared the driveway with a Ferrari and an Acura NSX, our 2016 Car of the Year. With its boldly updated, yet still classically   design, it more than held its own. In Grabber Blue, with black leather interior and some groovy racing stripes, I sort of fell in love. I didnt want to give it back. And so my message to you, brothers and sisters, is if you think a sports car might be for you, just get one of these.   Im often asked by people what car they should. .."
Jason Whitlock: The Far Left Wants to Overthrow Everything - Breitbart,Breitbart,Trent Baker,6/16/2017,"Friday, Fox Sports 1 personality Jason Whitlock reacted on Fox Business Networks Varney  Company to ESPN First Take   Max Kellermans preposterous argument that the NFL is injecting politics by playing the national anthem at their games.  According to Whitlock, people on the far left like Kellerman have bought into the far left ideology that is to overthrow everything.  We used to agree on certain principles here in this country, Whitlock began. And sports bought into the narrative, and affixed itself to the narrative that America is good and there are certain values and principles that we believe here in America that we have baked into the sports culture. And playing the national anthem at sporting events has been a long tradition that goes well beyond the NFL and football, and now we have people like Max, a good friend of mine but hes far       there are people, they just want to overthrow everything and everything that we used to agree upon, that Americas good, that there are some ideas and values baked into the American culture we also baked into sports culture, those things are good.  He continued, We played the national anthem, respect the flag, respect our military, remind ourselves of what we like about America. And now there are people that have just bought into this far left ideology that lets just overthrow everything. And we dont agree upon whether America is a force for good or not. We dont agree upon the values and principles we thought used to make America great. We dont agree upon those. Its a preposterous argument Max is making.  Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"

Limbaugh: The Swamp Has Got Trump Playing the Swamps Game - Thats Not What Trump Was Elected to Do - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/16/2017,"Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh warned President Donald Trump of playing the swamps game in governing.  According to Limbaugh, Trump was elected to drain the swamp, but has been bogged down in taking on the Justice Departments investigation of his alleged ties to Russia and how that investigation had taken on other aspects. Limbaugh argued although he was playing the swamps game, he had other tools at his disposal that he has yet to use. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): He could fire Rosenstein, and he could fire Mueller. Theres nothing stopping him from doing it, nothing legally. He could go to Rosenstein right now. He would be perfectly within his bounds to go to Rosenstein and say, Look, this investigation cant be wide open for anything. Youve gotta limit what these people can look for. Youve gotta limit it to actual felonious crimes. You cant have them subpoenaing anybody they want financial records, text records, tax records. There has to be a limit.  He would be perfectly within his bounds to do that because he is the executive branch. And if he wanted to fire these people, he could. When you see in the media, Theres no way he can do it, theyre talking politically. But since the independent counsel, special counsels been named, and now since they made sure to leak that Trump is under investigation, that is supposed to tie his hands, but it cannot tie his hands legally. If he wants to fire these people, he can. And if he wants to endure the excrement show that happens, he can. If he wants to drain the swamp, he could keep doing it. Now, the point is that once Trumps inaugurated, already under a cloud of suspicion that it limits his ability to drain the swamp because when he begins it taints what hes doing as rather than draining the swamp hes getting rid of people who could put him in trouble. Thats what Josh here is saying. And all that is true. But it need not stop him. What is being relied on, therefore, is conventional    thinking. Look, the Constitution has devised, for every branch of the government     the Founding Fathers were smart people, folks. They anticipated that there would be a   quest to consolidate power. They understood human beings. They understood that the executive branch was gonna try to become dictator. They understood legislative branch was gonna be trying to overthrow the executive. They understood that the judges are gonna try to trample over everybody. And so they gave every branch defense mechanisms against various forms of attack in order maintain the separation of powers. And these are still in place today. These various mechanisms that the branches can constitutionally use to rein in, say, an overzealous executive. Or that a president can use to rein in overzealous members of the executive branch. The executive branch cannot run anything legislatively and  . Now, Obama was able to take over the legislative branch cause they ceded it to him. The Democrats ran it, and they said, Were more than happy because we believe in centralized    and since we love Obama, since hes God, since hes Mr. Perfection, we are happy to cede our power to him.  And they did. Republicans have no desire to cede their power to Trump. Theyre holding onto it so Trumps in a battle with his own party for power, and of course the DOJ is not equally powerful as the executive branch. It is part of the executive branch. It does not have independent powers. The   defense mechanisms are what are being employed now. Okay, weve announced the special counsel and hes announced that the presidents under investigation, and so the political reality, the political consequences of using his executive power to broom all these people out of there is designed as a deterrent. But he could still do it. Its not constitutional or legal prohibitions stopping him. Its pure politics. And its the politics of the swamp, folks. The swamp has got Trump playing the swamps game right now. And thats not what Trump was elected to do, and thats not what Trump wants. Trump does not want to play the swamps game. I think the effort to get health care passed in the House was Trump playing the swamp game. And by swamp game, I mean the traditional way to get legislation passed. Somebody in the House comes up with a bill working with the White House and you got people that are for it and against it. You bring the detractors up to the White House, you wine and dine em, you cajole em, you beat em on the head. You do whatever, you try to get the bill passed, exactly the way its always been done in the swamp. That first health care bill that ended up not being voted on because it never had a chance, I never thought it was gonna have a chance because it was all swamp all the time.  Now, you might say, Well, I mean, Rush, the swamps the swamp. Theres no other way to get a bill passed. The presidents not a dictator.  I understand that. But Trump has many more tools at his disposal than he is aware of. I shouldnt say that. Hes got more tools at his disposal than he is using. The power vested in the president by the Constitution in the executive branch is awesome. Now, there are limits to it. Separation of powers. But he hasnt gotten close to utilizing it. Its just politics that is the obstacle to getting rid of Mueller since Mueller has now leaked that Trump is under investigation. Youve heard the media say if he gets rid of him now that takes us right back to Nixon. It takes us back to Nixon only because the media loved getting rid of Nixon. Nobody has any evidence Trump did anything yet. There isnt a shred of evidence even now, folks. If you read the Washington Post story on the latest examples of the independent counsel looking into financial     theres no evidence of anything. Its a wild good chase. Trump would not be throwing out any evidence if he fired these people and shut down this investigation. If Trump thought the investigation was needlessly harming the country and derailing us at a time we needed to be focused on real dangers and enemies, he could do it. There would be hell to pay in the media, dont misunderstand. I mean, it would dwarf whats happening. But he could do it, is the point. Now, he wont probably choose to do it because of the political ramifications of it. But the idea that hes been hamstrung since the beginning because he was inaugurated under investigation, and at that time we didnt even know what it was. It was just the FBI looking into Russia and collusion. Some of us have known that that was bogus from the  . Some of us have known that it was purely manufactured, invented by the Hillary campaign 24 hours after she lost. Some of us have never believed a single word of it and would have been happy if Trump acted that way as well. But he didnt. Why? Hes new. He wants to calm their fears. He wants to show them that the things they thought about him were not true, that the reasons they hated him were not grounded in any reality. He wanted to show them that he could work with them, be a good guy, we could all come together. Im sure thats what he wanted to do. And of course they want no part of that cause they dont want any part of Donald Trump succeeding in anything, anytime, anywhere. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

Whitlock urged the players to engage Trump if they have strong disagreements with him, but said their move, as well as other people who claim to be resisting the president, is   and really cowardly.  If Steph Curry and members of the Golden State Warriors have strong disagreements with President Trump, they should go engage him in debate and discussion, and make their disagreements known to him, and give him an opportunity to react. This whole thing of resist, and were not going to deal with this person, and were going to ignore this person, its unhealthy, its   its really cowardly.

From hysterics which was a diagnosis reserved exclusively for women sending them uncontrollably insane and they would have to perform a hysterectomy. Its actually just unique to a woman and her uterus.  Jedediah Bila fought back saying, If you watch her, and I have watched her repeatedly, she doesnt oftentimes let people answer the question. That is a fact. She doesnt let them answer to the point where they are, like, can I answer the question? You need to be careful in this country or anywhere when you label everything sexist.

Kate Hoffmann of nearby Hartland, Wisconsin sympathized: Very sad news about the man passing away, you just hope he was enjoying his final day watching the sport he loved.  Emergency personnel performed CPR by the   grandstand on the Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, man but he could not be revived. He was taken to an ambulance and soon thereafter pronounced dead.

Draymond Green and LeBron James got into a social-media war and the rest of the NBA started taking sides,Business Insider,Tyler Lauletta,6/16/2017,"Draymond Green and LeBron James may be done competing on the   court until next season, but their battle of trolling and     supremacy is only beginning.     While celebrating the Golden State Warriors title at the teams   championship parade on Thursday, Green was spotted wearing a   shirt adorned with a picture of the Larry OBrien Trophy and the   word Quickie. It was a   joke that referenced both   the efficiency with which the Warriors finished off the Cleveland   Cavaliers and the Cavs home stadium, the Quicken Loans Arena.     It was    shot at the Cavs and a bit of revenge   directed at James, given the  after the Cavaliers came out   victorious.    Draymond Green: I cant forget the Ultimate Warrior shirt from LeBron. The   tombstone cookies. I was waiting on this moment. Im petty.     It was easy to think James would miss the remark. After all, he   had been seen on Instagram earlier in the day too busy in the gym   dancing, working, and showing off his newly shaven head to spend   time watching the Warriors celebrate the title.       But as the parade continued, James became aware of the shirt and   was ready to zing back at Green with one of the internets most      jokes.     James hit Green with a Thats what she said.     tttWarriors won the title. Lebron won the internet.      The internet took notice and was quick to declare James had won   the internet for the day. At the moment, it was true     James had   trolled the troller. It was a move of   jiujitsu the   likes of which is rarely seen, especially among such     personalities.     The move was so vicious that other NBA players got involved.   James teammates JR Smith and Tristan Thompson popped into the   comments to show their support for the Cavs superstar with a few   emojis.

Doctors say the American student imprisoned in North Korea is experiencing unresponsive wakefulness  heres what that means,Business Insider,Dana Varinsky,6/16/2017,"Doctors caring for Otto Warmbier, the American student imprisoned   in North Korea for 17 months, said on June 15 that the      is in a state of unresponsive wakefulness.      Warmbier was detained as he was leaving Pyongyang in January   2016, and was subsequently sentenced to 15 years of hard labor on   the grounds that he attempted to steal a banner containing   political slogans.     On June 13, Warmbier was  reportedly in a coma,   and flown to Cincinnati. The Warmbier family  that the North Koreans suggested   Ottos condition was due to a case of botulism that he contracted   after his trial, combined with the effects of a sleeping pill.    Ottos father, has refuted that account.   He  that   his son went into a coma the day after his sentencing,   and had remained that way for more than a year before his   evacuation (though his family only found out a week ago).     Warmbiers doctors say they did not find any current signs   of botulism in his system. Instead, theyre suggesting he   suffered extensive brain damage     Warmbier has neither spoken nor   demonstrated any purposeful movements since returning to the US.     This pattern of brain injury is usually seen as result of   cardiopulmonary arrest where the blood supply to brain is   inadequate for a period of time resulting in the death of brain   tissue, Dr. Daniel Kanter, director of the Neurocritical Care   Program at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, said in a   press conference, .      Warmbiers state of unresponsive wakefulness most likely means   that he can open his eyes and has functioning reflexes, but is   unresponsive to commands and other tests of consciousness. This   is different than a coma, in which a patient is technically   asleep and keeps their eyes closed.     Until 2010, Warmbiers condition was generally referred to as a   vegetative state, but many  since it suggested that a patient   was somehow similar to a vegetable. The term actually dates back   to the 1800s, when anatomist and pathologist Marie Francois   Xavier divided the human nervous system into animalic and   vegetative functions. Vegetative, according to this early   definition, included many involuntary, automatic functions, like   the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. The animalic   processes were the ones that helped a person perceive and   understand their environment     intellect, locution, senses, etc.     The modern conception of a vegetative state was first put forth   in a  as a way   to describe medical patients whose sleep cycles and automatic   functions continued somewhat normally, but who didnt exhibit any   awareness of their own self or external environment. But in the   last five to 10 years, the term unresponsive wakefulness   syndrome has increasingly been used instead of vegetative   state to avoid negative associations.     A  of   cases of unresponsive wakefulness syndrome suggests that patients   in this state have neuronal function levels that remain below the   threshold required for them to experience consciousness. Their   chances of recovery therefore depend on how far their neuronal   activity is from this necessary level.     Doctors have thus far declined to speculate on Warmbiers   prognosis.

BANK OF AMERICA: Weve reached peak car,Business Insider,Graham Rapier,6/16/2017,"Disruption is Silicon Valleys favorite buzzword. And while the   forces of innovation and technology are hard to quantify, thats   not stopping Bank of America Merrill Lynch from trying.      The transportation sector in particular has $608 billion worth of   market share ripe for disruption from the     sharing economy, the bank said in a report.     We are reaching peak car in many developed markets, Bank of   America said. Transportation is costly and inefficient, making   the sector ripe for disruption.     On average, cars sit idle 95% of the time. Thats huge for a   country with 112 million registered vehicles. Freeing up those   dormant cars to be a part of the economy will take more than just   Uber.      Specifically, the bank points to four other specific areas that   will add to the disruption:     Cycling may seem unrelated to vehicle commuting, but 40% of car   trips are  (a roughly 20 minute bike ride). Bikes can also   bridge the final mile gap between mass transit and a workers   home or office.         Of course, entrenched enterprises arent going to go without a   fight. Jaguar Land Rover has  $25 million in Lyft and  on a   startup, just to   name a few.     Auto manufacturers and tech companies have been some of the   largest investors and movers on  writes Bank of   America. For some actors, this is a financial hedge against the   disruptive potential of mobility services. For others, it   strategically leverages their area of expertise.

Mission Accomplished: Consumer Sentiment Plummets After Comey Hearing - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Carney,6/16/2017,"Consumer sentiment unexpectedly dropped in June to the lowest level since the presidential election in November, according to the University of Michigans monthly survey. [The widely watched consumer sentiment metric fell to 94. 5 in June from 97. 1 in May. Economists had expected a slight increase.  Prior to the testimony of former Federal Bureau of Investigation chief James Comey, sentiment had been headed in the expected direction. It was averaging a score of 97. 7, the University of Michigan researchers said. Then Comey testified and consumer sentiment plunged. Since June 8, the index registered a score of 86. 7, a huge 11 point decline. The decline was observed across the political spectrum but was more pronounced among Republicans and independents. While this break corresponds with James Comeys testimony, only a few consumers spontaneously referred to him or his testimony when asked to explain their views. Importantly, the decline was observed across all political parties, but the loss in confidence among   Republicans since June 8th was larger than among Democrats (9. 2 vs. 6. 8  ) with Independents showing the greatest falloff (11. 5  ), the University of Michigan researchers said. In short, following the Comey testimony, consumers are far less optimistic about the economy."

It is shameful on the part of the administration and other politicians to cause a frenzy against something that is guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States. It does a disservice to this country and its position in the world and allows a heightened sense of rhetoric against journalists and media organizations.  Zucker reportedly added that it is unconscionable and dangerous and they should know better.  He made his remarks the morning after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) was shot on a baseball diamond by someone who hated Trump and Republicans. Those associated with CNN have spewed some of the most vicious vile at Trump and his supporters since Trump entered the White House. CNN had to fire Kathy Griffin after she posed with a bloodied severed head of Trump. The network also cut ties with Reza Aslan after he called Trump a piece of shit.  The Fake News Media has never been so wrong or so dirty. Purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate. Sad!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 13, 2017,  Last week, CNN whined after Trumps White House relegated the network to the Siberia section in the Rose Garden for Trumps joint press conference with Romanias president. We were in the equivalent of Siberia, no pun intended, when it comes to where we were seated, CNNs Jim Acosta said. That could be seen as an oversight on the part of the White House staff but it could also be seen as retaliation over the reporting were doing over here at CNN.  A Media Research Center report found that on May 12, CNN had a whopping 96   guests compared to just seven   guests during 20 hours of programming."
SJWs Give Milo Something Invaluable: A Bad BuzzFeed Review - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/16/2017,"BuzzFeed criticized former Breitbart Senior Editor MILOs new book Dangerous, calling it awful and complaining that it didnt dish any dirt on Breitbart News after receiving a leaked early draft. [Basing his review on a leaked early copy from Simon and Schuster, which MILO has claimed is no longer representative of the final product, BuzzFeed blogger Joe Bernstein claimed that the book was awful, boring, and terrible.   Regardless, if the version of Dangerous that comes out on July 4 is anything like the draft, it will be a terrible book, not good by any measure, claimed Bernstein. And in the two most important duties of its kind as an airport book     to reflect the zeitgeist and to entertain the reader     the draft is a staggering failure.  To begin with, there is little news in the Dangerous draft, unless you believe the specifics of Yiannopouloss beauty regimen to be newsworthy, he continued. Likewise, the draft does not offer a    look at Breitbart, the   media outlet that Yiannopoulos worked for until resigning amid controversy. (Yiannopoulos does, however, specially thank former Breitbart head and current White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon in the acknowledgements. ) When Bernstein asked MILO to comment on the books leak, MILO called it a sketch that has been substantially rewritten since then.  That manuscript has absolutely no relation to what we are printing on July 4, he continued, before adding, Im not interested in answering questions about a book that doesnt exist.  In an email to Breitbart Tech, MILO embraced BuzzFeeds review as a badge of honor. For a book thats so awful and boring BuzzFeed sure is desperate to destroy it! he declared. I look forward to their review of the final text in July. Impotent social justice warrior fury is how I heat my pool.  Dangerous soared to the #1 spot on Amazons best sellers list within a day of the announcement that it would be   and was available for   earlier this month.

4-Hour Workweek author credits a simple 3-step exercise with putting him on the path to success,Business Insider,Richard Feloni,6/16/2017,"Before he became famous for his 2007 bestseller , Tim Ferriss was an entrepreneur struggling   to make sense of what he wanted from life.     There was a moment in 2004 when he reached a turning point, he   said in  in Vancouver.     That year, a friend died of pancreatic cancer and the girlfriend   Ferriss planned on marrying broke up with him. He spent virtually   all of his time working on his nutritional supplement business,   using stimulants to stay awake and downers to go to sleep. It   was a disaster, he said. I felt completely trapped.     He came across a quote from the ancient Roman Stoic philosopher   Seneca that deeply resonated with him: We suffer more in   imagination than in reality. This led him to reading Senecas   ,   and it was there that he came across the philosophers exercise   premeditatio malorum, the   of evils.     Ferriss made some minor adjustments to the exercise, and gave it   the more accessible name of  in contrast to    . He credits it with putting himself on a path to   success, and he said hes repeated it at least once per quarter   since.      He explained the current iteration of his method to the TED   audience, and it involves just three pieces of paper and a pen.      Pinpoint What if. .. decision that has been weighing   on you, filling you with anxiety. When Ferriss first tried the   exercise, the question was, What if I take my first vacation in   four years of my business and spend a month in London,   crashing at my friends place?      Take your first sheet of paper and divide it into three   columns, titled Define, Prevent, and Repair.      In the Define column, write   things that you think could   go wrong if you answer your question in the affirmative. For   Ferriss, one of his fears was that   exposure to Londons   weather would trigger his depressive tendencies and make him   miserable.      In the Prevent column, answer: What could I do to prevent each   of these bullets from happening, or, at the very least, decrease   the likelihood even a little bit? For the example above, Ferriss   wrote that he could bring a portable light therapy machine that   worked for him and use it for 15 minutes every morning.      In the Repair column, answer for each point: If the     scenarios happen, what could I do to repair the damage even   a little bit, or who could I ask for help? Using the   weather example, Ferriss wrote that he could always spend money   on another flight and a hotel and end his vacation somewhere   sunny in Europe, like Spain.     On the second piece of paper, answer the question, What might be   the benefits of an attempt or a partial success? in regards to   making a decision in the affirmative.     Ferriss used a baseball metaphor to put this step into   perspective: Think of possible outcomes of a base hit, rather   than a home run.     Spend   minutes jotting down ideas.     Use your third sheet of paper to answer the question: If I avoid   this action or decision and actions and decisions like it, what   will my life life look like in say, six months, 12 months, three   years?     Think of all the   effects of inaction on areas like   emotional, physical, and financial  .     Spend as much time as necessary to put your thoughts on paper,   since Ferriss considers this to be the most important step   of the exercise.     He said that by the time he finished the exercise for the first   time, he realized that he had no choice but to extricate himself   from his business, and he ultimately went on a       trip around the world that inspired him to write The     Workweek.     Ferriss noted that sometimes our fears turn out to be     rather than the product of our imagination, But you   shouldnt conclude that without first putting them under a   microscope.

Neil deGrasse Tyson is creating a Space Odyssey video game about space exploration,Business Insider,Kevin Loria,6/16/2017,"Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson is making a video game about   space exploration.     Or trying to, anyway     the  went live on June 13 and runs   through July 29. At the time of writing, theyve raised $43, 240   of the $314, 159 goal ().     The game, called Space Odyssey, would allow players to   travel through the cosmos to scientifically accurate planets,   moons and exoplanets based in real science, according to a press   release emailed to Business Insider. Tysons basic   concept seems to be a captivating interactive experience   that still follows scientific principles.     I have no patience for people who say, I dont want the laws of   physics to constrain me, Tyson  at the video game E3   convention in Los Angeles this week.     On the Kickstarter page, the team behind the game promises a long   list of potential activities: Develop planets, colonize worlds,   nurture species, mine elements, build robots, and discover unique     as you coordinate with others in an intense game of     strategy.        Players would supposedly begin by exploring Proxima B, the   closest known exoplanet to our own solar system, just over 4   light years away (there are  there). After   exploring the surface of that planet and learning how the     physics systems work (with Tyson as your guide)   players would be ready to start the main event. Beginning   at a space station, theyd create and terraform a home   planet and system, taking into account real aspects of biology   and chemistry. That system can include be colonies and outposts       and you can play solo or with friends.     Players would also need to protect their systems from   threats, including environmental disaster, space objects, climate   change, disease, and the changes brought about by evolution and   whatever else may happen to a planet.     Luckily, a digital assistant with Tysons soothing voice would   guide you through all of this.     Players would also be able to design a spacecraft to explore   galaxies created by friends or prominent scientists and   fictional   like Tyson, Bill Nye, George R. R.   Martin, Neil Gaiman, and Peter Beagle, according to the   Kickstarter.        Plus, there would be bonus virtual reality   (VR) missions, playable on an Oculus Rift or Samsung Gear,   according to a fact sheet for the game.     The company behind the game is called Space Media Ventures. The   team includes producers who have worked in games, movies, and VR;   the comics creator behind Wolverine; and artists who have   worked on games like God of War 3.     Tysons role seems to be largely inspiration and helping ensure   that the game stays true to real science.     Mark Murphy, partner and creative director at Space Media   Ventures,  that Tyson helped create challenges in   the game, and has challenged our creative team to entertain and   inspire. He has also brought forward some incredible   collaborators to our efforts, an incredible team of scientists,   astronauts and explorers.     Space Odyssey seems to involve building activity similar to   Minecraft, space colonization akin to that in    Civilization: Beyond Earth, elements of exploration like No   Mans Sky, and echoes of    simulator, Kerbal Space   Program. Plus a whole lot of real (and really cool) science.     Thats ambitious, especially since the anticipated launch date of   Space Odyssey is January 2019.        With all that to design, the Kickstarter funding   seems unlikely to be sufficient for the project. But a   secondary purpose of the Kickstarter may be to   encourage community members to interact with and and   influence the game.     [W]e do have other funding sources for the game; those sources   are not contingent on the crowdfund. For us this is a committed   community build, we want the people who will be playing our game   to have the opportunity to engage while the build is underway,   Murphy told Business Insider. We are committed to providing   an enhanced physics experience which we call experiential physics   that will elevate game play regarding modding, mapping and   building and expressed action. I think its fair to say our   budget exceeds our community raise goal.     Its hard to say whether everything will really come   together by January 2019, but whenever the game gets released,   were excited to play     and learn while doing so.

Uber is blowing the door wide open for its toughest competition,Business Insider,Tanya Dua,6/16/2017,"As  rival Lyft   is surging.     After a trying few months, its been a particularly brutal week   for the   app. Tuesday saw the release of the results   of an intensive, monthslong investigation into its culture,   followed by  and   . And on Thursday, a   woman  for defamation, intrusion of privacy, and   public disclosure of private facts.     Meanwhile, Lyft has embarked on an aggressive campaign to   position itself as a socially conscious alternative in a crowded   field, and is  as well as community engagement   efforts. It has not only committed to  but has   also been pushing its Round Up & Donate program to get   riders to donate to favorite causes.     We are continuing to operate as we have from day one, focused on   our mission of improving lives through the worlds best   transportation, said Alexandra LaManna, a spokesperson for Lyft.   Now that Lyft has reached its current scale and can compete   aggressively on price point and pickup times, it comes down to   brand    what that brand stands for    and the experience.     Lyft seems to have some momentum: it  back in April, and recently   teamed up with . It has also been   winning consumer accolades, say branding and crisis   reputation management experts.     Uber projects an image that is careless,   sexist   and profiteering, aloof and uncaring, while Lyft appears be   benevolent and puts its values front and center, Susan Cantor,   CEO at branding firm Red Peak, told Business Insider A focus on   causes and social good always plays well with Gen Y and Gen Z,   who see altruism as a must. So Lyft is   and   clearly capitalizing on Ubers missteps.     Andrew Gilman, CEO at crisis communications firm CommCore   Consulting Group, agreed, saying that Ubers aggressive,     culture may have propelled it forward initially, but is the very   thing that is bringing it down now.     When that culture turns into a stampede and almost every   corporate action violates peoples personal beliefs, the tide   will turn and people will vote with their fingers and pick other   apps, he said. That is what is happening now.     Data shows that Uber has taken a serious hit, while Lyft has been   steadily gaining steam. Lyft has been closing the gap with Uber   in terms of app downloads, according to app analytics firm App   Annie,  on Tuesday.      Lyft has also overtaken Uber in terms of user engagement,   according to app analytics firm Apptopia. The percentage of   Ubers total monthly active users that use the app everyday has   been dropping considerably, from 20% in February to 18% in March,   to 17% in April, and down to 16% in May. On the other hand,   Lyfts usage has been consistent at 18% over the same time   period.                 Further, American consumer favorability of Uber has also hit a   record low, according to Morning Consult Brand Intelligence, a   brand survey firm, . The firm found that just   40% of the respondents had a favorable impression of Uber as of   this week, the lowest that number has been since the survey began   in 2016.     Lyft users took 70. 4 million rides in the first quarter of 2017   compared to 29 million rides in 2016,   which represents a    growth of   approximately 140 percent, according to the company.   This also equals an increase of 36%      with users taking 52. 6 million rides in the fourth quarter of   2016. Its drivers seem to be happier compared to Uber drivers as   well, with 76% of Lyft drivers saying that they were satisfied   with their experience driving for Lyft, versus 49% of Uber   drivers, according to Campbells,      Not only has Lyft been able to lift its brand by capitalizing   on Ubers mistakes, it has done so without directly attacking   Uber. This would help it go a long way, said Ben Ricciardi CEO of   branding agency Times10.      Its genius how Lyft has been able to do it without directly   calling Uber out, he said. Rather, they have chosen to do the   opposite of what Uber is doing, further connecting with their   patrons and positioning themselves as the good guys.      To be sure, Lyft is undoubtedly the underdog, and it is still a   long way from overtaking Uber. Ubers   revenue   was $3. 4 billion, up 18% from 2016s  . Lyft, on the   other hand told prospective investors in March that it expected   $800 million in   gross bookings,  Further, Uber trumps Lyft   in the number of downloads too, according to Apptopia, with   16 million downloads in May 2017 as opposed to 1. 3 million of   Lyft.     Ultimately, Lyft will need to keep  as well as attracting more drivers   to keep the momentum going, said experts.     Lyfts next step should be expanding its corporate and     efforts and empowering its     workforce said Chris Allieri, the founder and principal of the     firm Mulberry & Astor. Together with   recently   Lyft customers, Lyfts drivers can be the front      for Lyfts brand expansion.  Ubers brand has been hit, while Lyft is. .."
Seahawks Michael Bennett: Colin Kaepernick on Sidelines Proves America and the NFL are Racist,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/16/2017,"Apparently one of the biggest employers of African American athletes in the country is racist because one black player cant find a job, and the whole country is racist for allowing it. [At least that is what Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett said, citing   former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernicks inability to find a team to pick him up this year.  Kaepernick, who spent the whole of last year railing against the U. S. A. at every opportunity, declared his free agency for the start of the 2017 season. Even though he promised to drop his     protests on the field, no team picked him up for this season. The national   Kaepernicks inability to find a berth for 2017 has now spurred the Seahawks Bennett to claim the NFL and the country are just a bunch of middle American racists. I think the league is built on middle America, and most of the middle of America is predominantly a white crowd, Bennett said Wednesday. Thats just the truth of it. I think race is not something that the NFL wants to be a part of or get behind. But the league is predominantly  .  How the   Pro Bowl player doesnt see a disconnect between his claim the NFL is racist even though it is predominantly  is anyones guess. Further, how can middle America be filled with foaming at the mouth racists and still be fans of an NFL that is predominantly  ? Logic apparently isnt Bennetts thing. The player continued, according to ESPN, saying, So the issue that hes dealing with is what were all dealing with. We all come from the inner city, or weve been a part of communities where we felt like weve been judged because of the color of our skin or who we like or if a woman   any issue to deal with. Weve all been dealing with it with someone in our family.  Bennetts tirade was essentially based on the fact that Colin Kaepernick has been unable to find a new team to take him on. Kaepernick got one shot this year with Bennetts own team, the Seahawks. The Hawks, though, took a pass on the passer. It is probable that the team was never interested in the   protester in the first place because the invitation only went out after a Seattle politician published an open letter demanding that the team consider the former 49er. Seahawks coach Pete Carroll ended up going with the less experienced Austin Davis, leaving Kaepernick out of the game for 2017. Bennett, though, thinks he knows why Kaepernick is on the outside looking in. It isnt because he spent a year saying how much he hates America and Americans. No, its because all, yall are racists. Obviously, theres the elephant in the room why Kaepernick isnt signed, and most people know why, the Super Bowl champion said. Still, Bennett was on to something with another comment he made. I think race and politics in sports is something people dont want to hear about, nor do people want to be a part of, he said. Yes. Stick to sports, wont you? Still, the whole claim that the NFL is racist is not born out by the facts. First of all, the NFL is almost 70 percent African American. It is also a business where the average rookie salary is $365, 000 a year, a number that goes up by tens of thousands every year the player stays signed to an NFL team. It is also a league where the average players salary is about $1. 9 million annually. The NFL has created more black millionaires than any institution in the history of the world. But, if the league is built on racist white people, as Bennett claims, then the NFL achieved that record with white peoples money and with white peoples full participation. And that isnt even to mention the many millions of white fans who spend millions a year to buy merchandise dedicated to black players. Yet, the NFL is a sports league that is racist, unfair, and discriminatory to blacks? Money aside, was America or the NFL racist when it allowed Michael Vick back into the league after his convictions for animal cruelty? How racist was the league back in 1998 when it let Leonard Little continue his career after he thoughtlessly and selfishly killed a mother of three through his own drunk driving negligence? How is all that any evidence of racism? Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
American Wrestler in Mexico Infuriates Fans With Pro-Trump Rants in the Ring - Breitbart,Breitbart,Robert J. Marlow,6/16/2017,"An American wrestler devised the evilest, most notorious, and meanest persona south of the border to ensure his certain success in Mexicos professional wrestling league   Donald Trump. [Sam Adonis says that the idea came to him during the blazing heat of the 2016 presidential campaign.  He observed that people were so angry, and thought that if he donned a pair of wrestling tights with an image of Donald Trump on them he would become an instant villain for the Mexican fans who watch the Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) professional wrestling promotion.  Most people here hate Donald Trump without really knowing why, said the    250 pound Pennsylvania native, whose real name is Samuel Polinsky. Nobody knows anything about him. They dont read his policies, or anything he believes. Its the blind leading the blind.  According to Yahoo Sports, Adonis strikes an image of a rudo   tall, blond and handsome.  Moreover, he is a throwback to the days of   wrestlers The Heartbreak Kid Shawn Michaels and Mr. Perfect Curt Hennig. Im a flamboyant loudmouth, Adonis said. Im willing to shove my president down your throat. Im just such an ass that I want to be Trump. Im the high school quarterback that picked on you.  Adonis says that he watches so much wrestling its stupid. Im addicted to 80s wrestling.   Sams dad was a   wrestling promoter and his brother, who goes by Corey Graves, was a great wrestler and spends his time now out of the ring and in the broadcasting box for the WWE. An injury to Sam in 2011 redirected his journey from American to European leagues, and ultimately to Mexico.  Id probably be at the top of the game in the WWE [if I stayed healthy], he said. Their top guys might not be at the level I am. You can be in the system and not that good. Its like if a good prospect played basketball in Israel I can be better than LeBron but not seen yet.  All that being said, Sam Adonis stirs the ire of Mexicans while in the ring. As Yahoo reports, he turns old jingoism on its head.   Standing in the ring, he sings the Star Spangled Banner (poorly) and tells the fans, This city has the ugliest kids and the poorest men! He told Mercury News in February, Wrestlers dont get enough credit for being masters of human psychology. I know how to take people on an emotional roller coaster, so the fact that I can get people in such a frenzy and control them the way I want to, theres an artistic pride behind that."
"Alex Jones Leaks Megyn Kellys Interview Pitch: Its Not Gonna Be Some Gotcha Hit Piece, I Promise - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ezra Dulis,6/16/2017,"Alex Jones leaked the audio of a phone conversation Thursday night revealing Megyn Kelly promising him a fair,  gotcha interview as she invited him to appear on her new NBC News program. [I dont double cross, Kelly tells Jones, repeatedly assuring him that her interview would not dwell on conspiracy theories or familiar   attacks against the independent broadcast host. Rather, Kelly says that the focus of the news profile would be to humanize Jones and explore his personal life.   Jones himself appears in the video, revealing the private phone conversation on his website InfoWars in advance of Kellys Sunday broadcast. He annotates the audio clips with his own commentary, NBCs preview snippet of the   interview, and news clips about the ensuing uproar     where a besieged Kelly has denounced Jones coverage of the 2012 Sandy Hook mass shooting as revolting.  The video puts Kelly in a precarious position. As her fledgling weekend news magazine show fights for viability,   agitators have attacked her for interviewing Jones. A boycott sprang up before the broadcast ever aired, pressuring sponsors and reportedly convincing major brands to pull their . In response, she gave a statement contradicting nearly everything she promised in this phone call. The very question that prompted this interview, she claimed, is: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions? However, Jones has revealed, her pitch was the exact opposite: I promise you thats not what this will be [a hit piece], she says. It really will be about, who is this guy? Later on, she expresses her hope that some liberal viewers would come out of the segment saying, I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than Ive been led to believe.  So, which statement is true? That conclusion is not as easy as one would assume. Kelly now finds herself in the unenviable position of appeasing corporate sponsors spooked by   outrage while also trying to establish herself as a trustworthy interviewer. bShe has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a hit piece, she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: She has nothing to lose if Alex Jones feels betrayed and never talks to her again, but she does express fear during their conversation that if he calls her out for a hit piece, she will have trouble getting any more controversial,   subjects to appear on her show. And, based on the preview clips, Kelly will have to square that broken promise with this fervent declaration about her character: All I can do is give you my word and tell you     if theres one thing about me, I do what I say Im gonna do. And I     I dont double cross, so I promise you when its over youll say, Absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do.  Jones states that he has only released a few clips of his full phone conversation with Kelly and that InfoWars taped the entire NBC interview so that we can document   how she edited, how she manipulated.  He concludes: It shows the arrogance of Megyn Kelly that she didnt think wed record her to document what she really said and did.  Read selected transcripts of the Alex   Kelly phone conversation below: KELLY: Its sort of a good opportunity just for   storytelling. You know, its like     its not like the   interview, its like the   profiles of people. And at the top of my list was you. JONES: So its like an investigative report into fake news? KELLY: No. No, what were doing? JONES: Yeah. Come on. KELLY: No no no. Hell no. The reason you     I mean, I know you guys, you know, [inaudible]     The reason you are interesting to me is because I followed your custody case. And I think you had a very good point about the way the media was covering it and for some reason treated you and your family and what was going on as fair game when they never would have done that to, if you will, a mainstream media figure. And I saw a different side of you in that whole thing and I just     here, you know, you became very fascinating to me. I just sort of thought you were this maybe, you know,   guy     like, this is your thing     and the comments I heard from you during the course of that trial and your plea to the media to be respectful of you and your kids just reminded me that youre just like anybody. Youre a dad, you go through the same things we go through, and I thought, now, that would be an interesting story to tell.         JONES: Wouldnt the argument be, then, in the show, cause Ive seen that as a standard Democrat talking point     Im not saying thats what youre doing     Well, he asked for privacy in his family, but he didnt do that for Sandy Hook and he didnt do that for the pizzeria.  KELLY: No, I mean, I can ask you about that, you know, but this is not gonna be a contentious, you know, sort of gotcha exchange. I     Thats not what this show is and thats really not what I want to do. I want to do   profiles on people, just interesting people. So I can ask you that     this is what the critics say     but this isnt gonna be a  ! Lets play a clip.         JONES: I dont mind questions. What I dont like is, did you know or did your producers do that you, where I said Hillary Clinton personally     and it was    so I could get the satire out. You guys, took it out of context, but     did personally kill kids by the Iraq war and Syria war or the Libya situation, and you guys cut the back off of that      it was in the same 30 seconds, where I said Im not talking about the pizza place, Im talking about in the Middle East. KELLY: No, this is completely unfamiliar to me. JONES: Remember you had James Alefantis on Fox News, youre talking about fake news. KELLY: The guy from Comet Pizza? JONES: Yes, and then you played a clip of me saying Hillary personally kills children. KELLY: I, forgive me, Alex, but I dont remember the clip. I remember him [pause] and, you know, the nature of that exchange, which I think is the only time Ive ever said     um, [inaudible] anything. [In that Fox News segment, Kelly says to Alefantis: And someone could have been killed inside of your restaurant for no good reason other than people like Alex Jones fanned a conspiracy theory that even the DC police say has no basis in fact. ] JONES: Sure, sure, sure. I mean, all Im saying is, I can send you the Right Wing Watch clip where first reported it, and they said, Jones   you know, said that Hillary killed all these kids but then said it in Syria and Libya.  So, I mean Im just telling you, thats the kind of stuff that scares me, because I can stand for what Ive said, and I can even say, yeah I probably shouldnt [crosstalk] Sure, sure. KELLY: Listen, Ill take a look at that. Thats very unfamiliar to me. All I can tell you is that I bend over backwards to make sure that doesnt happen.        KELLY: Im sort of     you know, for lack of a better term, Im trying to create a different kind of program. And its fine. You know, Ill ask you about some of the controversies, of course. And youll say whatever you want to say. But its not going to be some gotcha hit piece, I promise you that. I     it doesnt do me any good. If I do that to you, then you go out there and you say, She did a hit piece on me. This is what she said, and this is what she did.  And then the next time I want to get somebody, theyre gonna say, Look what you did to Alex Jones, you know. Screw you.  So I promise you thats not what this will be. It really will be about, who is this guy? And well talk about some of the controversy, and Ill ask you, and you can respond, and well get into the whole, you know, what youve been through this past year. And my goal is for your listeners and the left, you know, who will be watching some on NBC, to say, Wow, that was really interesting.  [Note: At this point, the audio quality of Kellys phone call abruptly changes     All I can do is give you my word and tell you     if theres one thing about me, I do what I say Im gonna do. And I     I dont double cross, so I promise you when its over youll say, Absolutely. She did what she said she was gonna do.  And youll be fine with it. Im not looking to portray you as some boogeyman or, you know, do any sort of a gotcha moment. I just want to talk about you. I want people to get to know you. And the craziest thing of all would be if some of the people who have this insane version of you in their heads walk away saying, You know what? I see, like, the dad in him. I see the guy who loves those kids and who is more complex than Ive been led to believe.  JONES: Sure, but just so you know,  like, on all the Sandy Hook things, Ive had debates where Ive shown both sides where I go back and forth, but I believe people died there. And then they never show me really saying that, over the years, you know, you can look where the people that think nobody died are the ones all that hate me on the other side of it. And so what Im saying is, people take clips out of context     and I know Ive done a lot of stuff, some of which Im not proud of. So if people want to do a real piece or something, I mean, obviously, I dont want to sit here and, like, dodge all these interviews. Like, I told     they wanted me to tape something for Charlie Roses show, they wanted me to tape something for The View. Im not saying, oh, Im such a big, you know, famous guy, its just that     KELLY: No no, I understand. JONES: These taping things really just lends itself to be, you know, to ask yourself to be run over. But I understand, obviously, this is a magazine show, so its highly produced.        KELLY: Its like a whole new world over there [at NBC]. They deeply care about this kind of thing [fact checking]. And its not that we didnt care on cable, its just a different game on cable. You know, you move faster, and its more real time and, you know, thats just the fact that more mistakes get made. But I will promise you to personally look at any clips we want to use of you and have a producer run by you whether we are taking it in context and what you are saying about     JONES: Well, I say some pretty wild stuff, and Ill admit to a lot of its satire, but also, Im not trying to be, Im not being fake about what Im saying.        JONES: So this is like a reboot, relaunch for you     that youre not the, you know,   or   pundit from Fox. Youre an investigative journalist that does magazine, you know, investigations, or     KELLY: Exactly. So its like an entirely different set of muscles. And trust me when I tell you, my goal is not to go out there and be like, Oh my god, if I sit with her, shes gonna kill me! Like     but of course Im gonna do a fair interview. Im still me! You know, Im not gonna go out there and be Barbara Walters. You know. You just trust me. Its     I will ask you about the controversies. I will ask you in a non     you know, Ill be fair about it. Ill give you the chance to respond. And I really just want to talk about you, you know. You.        KELLY: I have not enjoyed being, in any way, on the pointy end of the political spear, you know. It was never anything I wanted to do. And so its not     you know, I would say that Im a combination of Mike Wallace, Oprah Winfrey, and Larry the Cable Guy. JONES: [Laughter] I know the Larry the Cable Guy. Hes a good guy. KELLY: I love him! And, so, like, thats what youll get in the interview. [Laughter] Thats     thats what youll get in the interview. [Laughter] Get, you know, a little bit of all three of those. And hopefully, everybody will walk away feeling like they had a good dinner. You know, nutritious, some red meat, with some dessert at the end."
Indian Lawmakers Demand Trump Reverse H-1B Crackdown,Breitbart,John Binder,6/16/2017,"Ahead of a meeting between with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, lawmakers are demanding President Donald Trump drop his executive order calling for a legal review of the   visa. [In April, Trumps signed an executive order targeting abuse by U. S. companies, Breitbart Texas reported, calling for the Department of Justice (DOJ) the Labor Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to conduct a full legal analysis of all the problems negatively impacting American workers in the   visa system.  As Trump and Modi are expected to meet in Washington, D. C. Indias top lawmakers want the   legal review dropped entirely. India Congress spokesperson Anand Sharma requested Modi tell Trump to reverse his   crackdown. He should demand and obtain credible and firm assurances from US President Donald Trump that he will reverse his decision which discriminates against Indian professionals       He cannot return  Sharma said. We do not want mere statements and photographs, Sharma said. We want answers and also how the Prime Minister responds and registers our protest over the disparaging observations made about the Republic of India recently when US decided to walk out of the Paris (climate) pact. We will wait for the Prime Ministers response or reaction.  Indias outsourcing and   visa industry, which relies on U. S. companies firing Americans and replacing them with foreign workers, have been rattled by the mere prospect of changes to the unfettered globalization business model. As Breitbart Texas reported, in 2017 SEC filings, the   outsourcing firm Infosys, which is responsible for the displacement of thousands of American workers, seemed worried about their future. An increase in   sentiments in certain countries in which we operate, including the United States and the United Kingdom, may lead to the enactment of restrictive legislations that could limit companies in those countries from outsourcing work to us, or could inhibit our ability to staff client projects in a timely manner thereby impacting our revenue and profitability, Infosys executives wrote in the SEC filing. Every year, more than 100, 000 foreign workers are brought to the U. S. on the   visa and allowed to stay for up to six years. That number has ballooned to potentially hundreds of thousands each year, as universities and   are exempt from the cap. With more entering the U. S. through the visa, Americans are often replaced and forced to train their foreign replacements. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder."
Report: Alexandria Attacker Carried List of Republicans Marked for Assassination - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/16/2017,"After police took out Alexandria attacker James Hodgkinson, they discovered an assassination list consisting of Republicans in his pocket. [Not only were the names on the list Republican, they were House members who are among the most conservative of Republicans. Life News notes that the three Representatives are  .  The Daily Caller reported that the list contained the names of  Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) Rep. Jeff Duncan ( ) and Rep. Trent Franks ( ).  All three representatives are members of the House Freedom Caucus and Duncan and Brooks were at the Congressional baseball practice on Wednesday, but Duncan left before the attack occurred. As Duncan was leaving he came upon Hodgkinson in the parking lot and said Hodgkinson asked if the players on the field were Republicans or Democrats.  Duncan told him the baseball players were Republican. CNN reported that Hodgkinson was a Bernie Sanders supporter who was strongly  .  After the attack, Breitbart News noted that Hodgkinson bought all this guns legally. Roll Call reported that the Alexandria Police, the Capitol Police, the FBI, and the ATF released a joint statement, which said, ATF has conducted traces on these weapons and has determined that both were purchased by the shooter from federal firearms licensees.  The New York Times reported that Hodgkinson was licensed to buy guns in Illinois, his state of residence. That license   a Firearms Owners ID (FOID) card   also requires an   background check. The bottom line   Hodgkinson is yet another proof that background checks do not   and cannot   stop latent criminals they only stop actual ones. Background checks look backward, therefore, citizens with no criminal history have no discoverable reason to prevent a gun purchase. This is why the NRA and others oppose the Democrats ongoing push for universal background checks. The checks will never be able to stop determined attackers who lack a criminal history, but they will make it harder for   citizens to get the guns they need for  .

Report: DAG Rosenstein Considering Recusal from Russia Investigation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/16/2017,"ABC News reported Friday that Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Robert Mueller as special counsel for the Russia investigation last month, may be considering recusing himself from that investigation. [According to ABC, sources stated that Rosenstein, the number two man at the Department of Justice, has privately acknowledged to colleagues that he may have to recuse himself from the matter.   The DOJ, however, insisted the deputy attorney generals stance on recusal remains the same. As the Deputy Attorney General has said numerous times, if there comes a point when he needs to recuse, he will. However, nothing has changed, DOJ Spokesman Ian Prior told Breitbart News. Rosenstein came to be the top law enforcement official with regard to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 elections after he was sworn in in April. In March, Attorney General Jeff Sessions himself had recused himself based on his being involved in the Trump presidential campaign. Following the leak of   Director James Comeys   let this go memo, supposedly based on a conversation between President Donald Trump and himself, in May, Rosenstein made the decision to appoint Mueller as special counsel for the investigation. Under oath before Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey admitted he himself leaked the memo to the press through friend and Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman with the specific purpose of forcing Rosensteins hand to make that appointment. Mueller was Comeys predecessor as head of the FBI and a friend and mentor of his. Questions have been raised about the future of Muellers role, especially given his appointment of several attorneys who have either represented the Clinton Foundation in the past or were themselves donors to the Hillary Clinton campaign for president to serve beneath him in the investigation. The prospect of Rosensteins recusal comes amid reports the rapidly expanding special counsel investigation is shifting away from alleged collusion between Russian officials and the Trump campaign and towards allegations of obstruction of justice by the president. President Trump has vigorously objected to the propriety of such an investigation. Presumably, a probe into possible obstruction would involve investigating the Comeys firing in May. Rosenstein himself wrote the memorandum on which Trump ostensibly made that decision, calling for Comeys dismissal based on his handling of the Clinton email server scandal. His involvement in the firing has lead to speculation Rosenstein may need to act as a witness for Muellers investigation. Asked about the prospect and his potential need to recuse during his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Rosenstein said only, I am working with career professionals who know these rules and are responsible for enforcing these rules, and I can assure you that were going to do the right thing, and were going to defend the integrity of that investigation.  The same ABC report cited sources claiming Rosenstein has not, as of yet, formally asked DOJ ethics attorneys for advice on recusal. A growing group of law professors, however, have joined the president in questioning Muellers decision to look into obstruction over the matter. Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz has told media outlets several times that he does not think a case for obstruction is possible given the facts, as has Florida International University College of Laws Elizabeth Price Foley. Randy Barnett, Georgetown University Law Centers Carmack Waterhouse Professor of Legal Theory, called on Mueller to resign over his own ties to Comey, also a subject of the investigation, in a series of tweets Thursday: Mueller should resign not recuse. If he recuses, the matter will be delegates to one of the Democrat attack lawyers hes hired.       Randy Barnett (@RandyEBarnett) June 15, 2017,  The only way out I see is for AG (not DAG) to appoint a truly    special counsel to investigate the (bogus) obstruction      Randy Barnett (@RandyEBarnett) June 15, 2017,  Should the deputy attorney general choose to recuse himself, ultimate authority for the Russia investigation would fall to DOJs number three, Associate Attorney General Rachel Brand."
Shareholder: CNN Acting Like Part of Anti-Trump Resistance - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/16/2017,"A Time Warner shareholder accused CNN of acting like it was the part the resistance movement against President Donald Trump.  Im inquiring about CNNs bias and our return on investment, shareholder David Almasi reportedly told Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes during Thursdays annual shareholders meeting. Half the American public   which includes potential and current CNN viewers   voted for Trump last November and supports his agenda. CNN acts as if it is part of the   resistance.  According to the Hollywood Reporter, about half of the 300 people at the annual shareholders meeting applauded Almasi while several others later approached him to thank him for his questions.  Almasi reportedly cited data from the Media Research Center indicating that among the CNN panelists dissecting the May 9 firing of FBI director James Comey, 96 were   and seven were  .  Time Warner is CNNs parent company, and Bewkes also defended Time Warners support of the Trump assassination play being staged by The Public Theatre in New York. Bewkes reportedly said were certainly not going to drop our support when asked by a shareholder how the company could support the play after House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) was shot. Bank of America and Delta Airlines recently dropped their support of the The Public Theatres Julius Caesar production   which depicts a   Caesar character being brutally stabbed to death   after strong backlash."
CNN Fake News Protest Picking up Steam Following Leftist Attack on GOP Lawmakers and Staff,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/16/2017,"A protest planned for Saturday at CNN headquarters in Atlanta is gaining steam as protesters rally around President Donald Trump and Republicans following a shooting on Wednesday aimed at GOP lawmakers and staff as they practiced for the annual Congressional baseball game at Nationals Park. [The shooter, an outspoken Bernie Sanders supporter and activist for liberal causes, wounded five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who remains in critical condition following multiple surgeries.  We encourage everyone to keep Rep. Scalise in your prayers for a speedy recovery and the other victims, Debbie Dooley of Main Street Patriots, organizer of the rally, told Breitbart News. We will have a moment of silence at the protest to pray for the victims of the leftist assassin.  The gunman,    James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, died from his injuries after Capitol Police on security detail for Scalise engaged him in a gun battle. Organizers of Saturdays event say they want to show support not only for President Donald Trump but now for Republicans     like Scalise, a longtime Trump supporter     and speak out against the   rhetoric and fake news from CNN and other media outlets.  I am very encouraged by the interest in the CNN fake news protest, Dooley told Breitbart News.  Ive noticed a big uptick in the intensity level of folks interested in attending the protest after the cowardly assassination attempt of Republican Congressmen by someone on the radical left in Alexandria, Virginia on Wednesday.  Dooley said she is not concerned about the safety of protesters. One big reason is that Georgia is an open carry state and violent thugs would be insane to attempt violence at our peaceful protest, Dooley said. This hate filled rhetoric against President Trump has permeated many media outlets like CNN, the Washington Post and the New York Times, Dooley said. Some of CNNs hosts engage in   hysteria in their attempt to bring down the   President of the United States.  They helped create the toxic atmosphere that Hodgkinson would believe it is open season on Republicans, Dooley said. It is time for Trump supporters to rise up and say with a loud voice, enough.  Bikers for Trump 2020 will also take part in the protest. Bikers for Trump will be at CNN headquarters on Saturday because in our opinion there is no way to measure this level of journalistic malpractice, Founder Chris Cox told Breitbart News. CNN exemplifies vigilante journalism.  Tim Selaty, president of Citizens for Trump, will also bring supporters to Saturdays rally. We the American citizenry, who dutifully elected Donald J. Trump as our president, are completely fed up and disgusted with CNN and other liberal media outlets continually launching malicious fabricated propaganda (aka fake news) attacks on our P. O. T. U. S. , Selaty told Breitbart News. He went on: We believe this fake news media movement to destroy our president is not only hurting the credibility of mainstream media and undermining our election process but is equally impacting our American society in a very negative way as weve seen by the recent attack in Virginia on our elected Republican officials. We demand that CNN and all media outlets have ethics and truth in their reporting or we will continue to mass protest at their headquarters and express our discontent with their sponsors. We ask all of our fellow patriots to stand with us this Saturday at CNNs headquarters in Atlanta, Georgia and send a clear message to CNN and all other media outlets guilty of spreading unsubstantiated stories to hurt our president and fellow Americans. No more fake news, Selaty said. The protest will take place from 11:00 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. Saturday at CNN, located at 190 Marietta St. NW, Atlanta, Georgia. Coxs group will also hold a rally on Sunday in Marietta, GA. in support of Republican congressional candidate Karen Handel. The Bikers for Trump phenomenon will continue to support congressional races across the country for the Republican candidates that pledge support for Trump and we will hold them accountable to that pledge, Cox said. Were encouraging people to come out and support our president, said Dooley, who is also one of 22 national   of the Tea Party. And to condemn the extreme biased coverage at CNN."
"Report: Marines Nude Photo-Sharing Scandal Suspect Facing Court-Martial, Another Discharged - Breitbart",Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/16/2017,"A Marine Corps service member is facing a   while another has been discharged following the Marines United nude   scandal. [[Marine Corps Commandant Gen. Robert] Neller told Senate Armed Services Committee lawmakers that 65 individuals were identified in the scandal     in which service members allegedly shared nude photos of female Marines and veterans in the private Facebook group Marines United,     and that 59 were sent to their commands for possible disciplinary or administrative action, reported The Hill on Thursday. Of the 59 individuals, seven have received   punishment, 20 have received adverse administrative actions, and one Marine has been administratively separated.   The service is also planning an Article 32 hearing to determine whether there is enough evidence to warrant a   on one suspect, but Neller did not say if it was a Marine, they continued. General Robert Neller also detailed how he and other leaders spoke to tens of thousands of Marines to make them understand their responsibility. Ive gone personally, as all of my leaders have gone, and spoken to literally tens of thousands of Marines and made them understand what their responsibilities are, claimed Neller. The social media things that weve seen have been       were just indicative of a problem within our culture that we did not properly respect or value the contributions of women in our Corps and thats the problem we have to fix.  In April, it was reported that sharing private nude photos had been made a crime in the U. S. Marine Corps and Navy following the scandal, which led to nude images of female Marines ending up for sale on the dark web. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

A predictor with a perfect track record on the American economy is moving closer to signaling a recession,Business Insider,Jonathan Garber,6/16/2017,"A key predictor of the health of the American economy is inching   closer to signaling a recession.     The indicator in question is the US Treasury yield curve, a   measure of the gap between   and   interest rates.   When it is steep     meaning it costs more to borrow money for the   long term     thats a good sign investors expect a quickly growing   economy.     A flattening one suggests a slowing one. Thats whats occurring   now.     The spread between the yields on   and   Treasurys   fell to 79 basis points, or 0. 79% after Wednesdays   disappointing  and    data. The spread is currently within a few hundredths of a   percentage point of being the tightest it has been since 2007.     Perhaps more notably, it is on a path to inverting     meaning it   would cost more to borrow for the short term than the long term       for the first time since the months leading up to the financial   crisis.     An inversion would most likely be a signal that a recession is   imminent. An inverted yield curve has a  according to   RBCs Jonathan Golub. You can see this in the chart below     the   shaded areas are recessions.        On Wednesday, in an indication that policy could tighten further,   the Federal Reserve  for the fourth time since   the financial crisis and  to unwind its massive $4. 5 trillion balance   sheet.     The Fed also signaled that it remains committed to its plan for   gradual   increases. The Federal Open Market   Committee said on Wednesday that it continues to expect that,   with gradual adjustments in the stance of monetary policy,   economic activity will expand at a moderate pace, and labor   market conditions will strengthen somewhat further.     A further tightening of policy would most likely cause the yield   curve to flatten even more, and possibly invert. Thats because   Fed rate hikes cause the front end of the curve to rise faster   than the long end.        So where is the yield curve going from here?     A basic technical analysis shows that a double top has formed   over the past six years or so and suggests the yield curve could   flatten to about   basis points.

House Democrats frustrated by Trumps national-security policies have launched a task force,Business Insider,David Choi,6/16/2017,"A group of House Democrats have launched a task force to address   President Donald Trumps policies that they say compromise our   national security.     Chaired by Reps. Seth Moulton of Massachusetts, Stephanie Murphy   of Florida, and Jimmy Panetta of California, the Democratic   Caucus National Security Task Force aims to address the most   pressing security challenges, and hold the Trump administration   accountable, according to a statement.     The Trump administration has taken     or pledged to take       certain foreign policy actions that are likely to compromise our   national security, weaken our alliances, and undermine our   values, read a statement from the three representatives. Our   constituents seek a steady hand at the helm of our ship of   state.     Democrats need a strong, smart, and strategic approach to   national security, said Moulton. This task force will hold the   administration accountable in a thoughtful and impactful way,   while working to find the best solutions to the national security   issues facing our country.     The formation of the task force comes months after a US cruise   missile strike at a Syrian airfield     a response to corroborated   reports of a deadly chemical attack on Syrias civilian   population. Although Congress broadly supported Trumps decision   after the fact, he has been criticized for the lack of a thorough     plan, which may have    due to ongoing volatility in the region.      The lack of a concrete plan is further evidenced by the US being   continually roped into the Syrian conflict through a proxy war       the  involving a US   fighter jet shooting down a     regime drone after it had attacked   forces   in southern Syria.

Illegal Alien Support Group Forces Border Patrol to Get Warrants,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/16/2017,"A group known in Arizona for assisting illegal aliens through the desert after they cross the border forced U. S. Border Patrol agents to obtain a warrant to search for migrants in their camp. The agents later arrested four Mexican nationals. [Border Patrol agents assigned to the Tucson Sector used technology surveillance to detect four suspected illegal aliens who crossed the border along a known human smuggling route. The four individuals were wearing camouflage as they walked northward from the Mexican border, according to information provided to Breitbart Texas by U. S. Border Patrol officials.  Other agents working near Arivaca, Arizona, tracked the four migrants to a No Mas Muertes (No More Deaths) Camp. No Mas Muertes is an organization that assists illegal aliens in their march through the Arizona desert. When agents contacted camp officials to search for the alleged illegal border crossers, the officials refused. Tucson Sector Border Patrol reached out to No Mas Muertes Camp representatives to continue a positive working relationship and resolve the situation amicably, Border Patrol officials stated. The talks, however, were unsuccessful.  Agents subsequently sought and obtained a warrant to search the camp and question the four suspected illegal aliens. Agents found the migrants and questioned them about their citizenship and legal right to be present in the U. S. Satisfied that the four people were illegally present in the country, agents took them into custody. A similar incident occurred a month earlier, officials stated. Agents detected eight individuals entering the camp. The negotiations with camp officials, in that case, were successful. Agents arrested the eight illegal aliens and subsequently learned that at least two of the foreign nationals had significant criminal histories from previous illegal entries into the U. S. Two other illegal aliens were in need of medical attention. Those migrants were transported to an area hospital for evaluation and treatment. Camp officials reacted harshly to this weeks arrest of illegal aliens in their camp. Todays raid on the medical   is unacceptable and a break in our   agreements with Border Patrol to respect the critical work of No More Deaths, Abuse Documentation and Advocacy Coordinator Kate Morgan stated in an article published on the groups website. They claim to operate their camps as a medical facility under the International Red Cross Standards, which the say gives them the right to refuse cooperation with Border Patrol agents. The Border Patrol acknowledged that they tracked a group for 18 miles, but only after the migrants sought medical treatment did the Border Patrol seek to arrest them, No More Deaths Founder John Fife claimed. The choice to interdict these people only after they entered the No More Deaths camp is direct evidence that this was a direct attack on humanitarian aid.  At the same time, the weather forecast is for   deadly temperatures.  While the groups website claims their goal is to help the illegal aliens in their efforts to enter the U. S. at least one of article posted on their site could place migrants in more danger. The article written by Aljazeera America, titled For migrants in Arizona who call 911, its Border Patrol on the line, appears to warn migrants in distress in the desert against calling 911. When most people dial 911 due to a medical emergency, they dont expect to talk to Border Patrol, the group states. But thats exactly what happens to many undocumented migrants who call for help from Arizonas southern desert.  The article continues: When 911 calls come in to BORSTAR, supervising agent John Redd said, quite often callers in distress dont realize they have been transferred to Border Patrol. And the agency doesnt inform them, according to Redd: [W]e dont tell them its the Border Patrol, because were trying to preserve life. But the fact is weve got another job to do, too. If we do tell them its Border Patrol, when we get there, theyre going to be gone.  If agents manage to find migrants in distress, they stabilize them medically and then book them, Redd said. Advocates for migrants say this system prioritizes the apprehension and deportation of migrants and leads to needless deaths. Calls from migrants in distress sometimes bounce from one agency to another, with no mechanism to ensure accountability or track how cases are handled. Determining whether a caller is an undocumented migrant is at the discretion of the 911 dispatcher who picks up the phone call and is often based on racial profiling, said Cristen Vernon, the   project coordinator with Derechos Humanos, an immigration advocacy group in Tucson. However, Breitbart Texas has reported regularly on illegal aliens in distress that are rescued by Border Patrol agents and BORSTAR rescue teams. Earlier this month, Pima   dispatchers notified Border Patrol of a 911 call from a distressed alien in the desert. Border Patrol agents found the man struggling for his life. BORSTAR agents responded with their emergency medical training, giving him immediate help. Agents called a Life Flight evacuation helicopter for transport. Life Flight flew the illegal migrant flown to a Tuscon hospital for treatment. Had the man not called 911 and had Border Patrol agents and BORSTAR not responded, the man likely would have died alone in the desert. In May, Border Patrol agents rescued five other illegal aliens near the Ajo Station. On balance, it is the ruthless   human smugglers who put these illegal aliens at risk in the desert. If a person being smuggled falls behind for any reason, such as dehydration, injury, or exhaustion, the coyotes will simply leave them behind to die in the desert. In May, U. S. Customs and Border Protection officials issued a warning about the dangers of crossing the border in the heat of the summer. Unscrupulous smugglers often abandon migrants in the desert who fall behind. , CBP officials stated. As a result, many perish every year. Border Patrol officials encourage anyone in distress to call 911 or activate a rescue beacon before becoming a casualty. In the fiscal year 2016 Tucson Sector Border Patrol agents rescued over 1, 400 persons with many of those rescues conducted in the western Arizona region.

Kamala Harris is every woman who stands up to speak,CNN,Roxanne Jones,6/16/2017,"(CNN) Washington may be a tough town where the big boys roam free, but apparently, freshman Sen. Kamala Devi Harris makes these career politicians nervous.  Educated, experienced and ready to rumble, the senator from California will not be silenced, especially when it comes to getting at the truth in the Russian investigation hanging over Donald Trumps administration, though that is exactly what her male colleagues want to do: silence her.  Again and again during the Senate intelligence committee hearings into Russian interference in the 2016 elections, Harris, who is of black and Indian descent, has been reprimanded by her   male colleagues for simply doing her job: asking direct questions and expecting direct answers in return.  By her colleagues and by pundits, shes been called too tough, too rude, even hysterical by one former Trump campaign adviser.  The only senator to be cut off for asking tough questions in these hearings has been Harris, once last week while questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein and then again Tuesday when Attorney General Jeff Sessions was testifying. This reaction to Harris is a double standard. An ugly intimidation tactic applied to working women that should not be tolerated. Not today. Because lets be clear, what really appears to rankle these men is Harris courage, her confidence in her own skin. She is a woman of color who is not afraid to challenge the status quo. Its for the good of the nation that she refuses to be silent.  Harris questions, though persistent, have never crossed the line of being rude or disrespectful. She doesnt raise her voice or throw around accusations or insults.  Not a peep of reproach was heard from men on the committee as her colleague and fellow Democrat, Sen. Ron Wyden, accused Sessions of stonewalling. Other senators also got into tense exchanges.  Senators, this is unacceptable. Something tells me that Harris, who served two terms as San Franciscos first female district attorney and then was the first woman elected as California attorney general, has been through this before, maybe her entire career.  I know that I certainly have, and frankly its gotten a little boring. This old boys club strategy is familiar:  the blatant disrespect and machismo that singles out women, especially intelligent women of color, who insist on being a part of the conversation.   Kamala Harris is every working woman who has ever earned a position of power and has not been afraid to use it. She is an inspiration. The way she approaches her career reminds us women that we need not carry the weight of men who have not learned to see us as equals. We cannot allow them to hold us back, or silence us into  .  For me, Harris represents every woman whos ever decided to stand up and be heard, no matter how large or small our platform. She is Sen. Maxine Waters and Michelle Obama. She is Arianna Huffington and Hillary Clinton. She is me. And she is you.  Many Americans watching the Senate hearings this week related to Harris frustrations as Sessions continuously refused to give direct answers. She, like others on the committee, were weary of Sessions repeated nonanswers of I dont recall, or, I dont remember. Harris wanted a yes or no answer. Seemingly, less concerned with getting a firm answer than they were with rescuing Sessions, Sens. John McCain (who isnt even on the Senate intelligence committee) and Richard Burr, committee chairman, cut off Harris questioning.   These are not delicate days. Wednesdays tragic politically motivated shooting, which injured GOP Rep. Steve Scalise  and four others at a Republican baseball team practice ahead of a charity baseball game, make it seem as if our political divisions grow deeper each day. But we have to hope that some things are still sacred. Surely, we can agree on some general principles of democracy: Russia interfering with a US election cant be tolerated.  The possibility that political operatives may have colluded with a foreign government, in any way, must be investigated.  And, any possibility that the President of the United States or any of his operatives tried to obstruct justice must be investigated to the fullest extent of the law, no matter how many tough questions it takes to get to the truth. Americans want answers. We want to believe the truth still matters in politics. Kamala Harris is a refreshing,   voice.  So senators, step aside, stop interrupting and let the woman do her job."
Japan votes for worlds largest pop group,CNN,Marian Liu,6/16/2017,"(CNN) There are stump speeches, handshakes and even an official statement refuting voting fraud. But the election isnt for a president, but for an angel in the worlds largest pop group AKB48. A total of 322 members are in the running for 16 coveted spots performing and singing their 49th single to be released in August.  Think Baby One More Time era Britney Spears, cloned over and over. As Japans most popular and   girl pop group, AKB48 sold over 50 million CDs since launching in 2005, ranking in the top four highest selling music groups in Japan. Their last single Negaigoto no Mochigusare, was recently released on May 31 and sold 1. 3 million in the first week. I am totally taken into the marketing plot. I know that and I am enjoying it, said    fan Norio Uchida at AKB48s permanent venue, Tokyos AKB Theater.  Unlike the usual idols who are always cute and great, the gap, or offbeatness is attractive to me . .. They are very ordinary. Thats great. Like Uchida, many of their fans are male and come out in droves to vote in their annual election. Results will be announced on June 17 in the   resort of Okinawa, with nearby lodging already booked solid since April, with some 10, 000 expected, reported Okinawan news site japanupdate. com. For the last couple years, there were more than 3 million votes.  Marketing genius This friendly competition between the members and fans is pretty genius, it guarantees very high sales, said Kyle Phillips, a    Canadian who voted in the elections online from 2010 to 2012 and founded the Japanese pop culture site ARAMA! JAPAN. Fans have been known to literally buy dozens, sometimes hundreds, copies of the single to support their favorite member. To vote, fans buy a CD at around $15 for a ballot, but some spend thousands of dollars, sometimes hundreds of thousands, to ensure their favorite wins.  In principle, we are happy to have the people participate to the election, said Junji Yuasa, Chairman of the AKB48 General Election committee. We just can say to the fans that you would not have to go too far. AKB48, which stands for their hometown of Akihabara, Japan, includes more than 120 members, but their four sister group members are eligible for the election too, taking the total to 322.  They are in their teens to  s, and split up into teams to rotate performances and when they graduate are replaced by trainees. And like Spears, they flirt with the schoolgirl image and sexuality with short skirts and sometimes suggestive lyrics.   They are commercial darlings, selling everything from chocolate to cell phones and even hawking for Japan in a military recruitment video and government bonds. AKB48 even spawned their own manga series, video games and several sister groups, like Shanghais SNH48, Jakartas JKT48 and Manilas MNL48. But what sets them apart from other pop groups is their mantra: idols who you can go and meet. They hold regular    and concerts in their own venue, the AKB48 Theater. Regular and accessible  It basically revolutionized the idol industry not only in Japan, but Asia as well, said Phillips. Idols used to be something you only saw on television, or from far away on a stage, but AKB48 really helped change all that. And unlike the more polished stars of Korean pop, AKB48 members are more like the girls next door. The charm of KB is being natural. They were not trained at all. They were not good at singing or dancing, said Yuasa. Fans go to the theater to enjoy them improving. They feel like parenting your favorites. But for a group that often dresses alike in concerts and music videos, AKB48 members have to differentiate themselves during the election. They design posters and make speeches that could include anything from cooking to playing the guitar.  Its tough to stand out in crowd, said Yui Yokoyama, the team leader of AKB48. We are such a big group. The members are constantly thinking about her own uniqueness. The election, however, does take a toll on group members. Yokoyama said she became very emotional from the pressure and could not stop shivering. She joined in 2009, first entered the election in 2010 and did not even break the top 80. She ranked No. 11 in last years election. Although the group has been around since 2005, no members have reached the level of same level of success solo. And while Yokoyoma wants to be in AKB48 forever, she knows its not possible.  AKB is a passing point and I learned a lot in AKB and will use the experience for the future dream, said Yokoyoma who wants to be an actress who sings."
Russia says it may have killed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/16/2017,"(CNN) The Russian Defense Ministry said it is investigating reports that ISIS leader Abu Bakr   was killed in one of its airstrikes in Syria last month. The May 28 airstrike was carried out on the outskirts of the militant groups de facto capital, Raqqa, on a command post where ISIS leaders were meeting, according to a ministry statement. According to information that is being verified through various channels, the leader of  ISIS . .. Abu Bakr   was also present at the meeting and was killed as a result of the strike, the ministry said. The United States confirmed that Russia conducted airstrikes on May 28, a US official said.  The Americans are investigating whether the strikes were in the precise area the Russians are claiming and whether there is any intelligence on who may have been in that location, the official said. There have been previous reports of Baghdadis death that later turned out to be false. The Russian statement said the strike targeted ISIS leaders as they met to discuss their exit from the city. It said about 30 midlevel field commanders and up to 300 militants acting as bodyguards were also present. The airstrike was carried out following drone footage confirmation of the meeting location, the statement said.  CNN senior international correspondent Clarissa Ward warned the details from the Russians were inconsistent with the typical behavior of ISIS leaders.  They do not meet in big groupings like that because of drone strikes, because they are constantly being bombarded, she said. If he has been killed, of course it would deal a big blow to the group, but lets just look at the past few weeks    weve had major terror attacks in London, in Baghdad, in Tehran, in Kabul. So clearly it is still business as usual for ISIS. CNN military analyst Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling also warned against giving too much weight to Russias sources. Im not going to take this too seriously because there have been at least five reported killings of   over the last three years, he said. I wouldnt believe the Russian sources based on anything theyre hearing out of Syria. An elusive and brutal leader, Officials have long described the ISIS leader as enemy No. 1 in the fight against ISIS, and speculation has swirled over his whereabouts. Baghdadi has kept a low profile, speaking out in occasional videos and audio messages.  In a sermon at a Mosul, Iraq, mosque in 2014, he declared himself the leader of the Islamic caliphate. The sermon was filmed and widely watched around the world. US forces captured him in Falluja, Iraq, in 2004. At the time, he was considered a   al Qaeda member.  He was freed in 2009, and within a year became the leader of Iraqs al Qaeda affiliate, heading up a renewed campaign of bombings and assassinations. Al Qaeda leaders later severed relations with him, saying he was insubordinate, killing too many civilians.  He earned a reputation for brutality as the leader of ISIS, which has seized and lost swaths of territory in Iraq and Syria.  The extremist group brought a reign of terror and intimidation into areas where they gained control. And the brutality has continued despite military setbacks. In one reported case, ISIS slaughtered 163 civilians and left their bodies in the street for days, the United Nations said.  US authorities offered a $25 million reward for information leading to his capture. Abu Bakr   which is a nom de guerre, was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim Ali   al Samarrai."
"After the game, can the good feelings last?",CNN,Stephen Collinson,6/16/2017,"(CNN) The congressional boys of summer ditched partisan hardball for seven innings of healing Thursday at their annual baseball classic just 36 hours after a horrifying gun rampage at a Republican batting practice. America the Beautiful rang out across Nationals Park, an injured police officer who saved many lives on Wednesday threw out the opening pitch, and wounded GOP whip Steve Scalise was on everyones mind. But after the last at bat of a night of rare unity in Washington, and a game the Democrats won   in seven innings, some were wondering just how long the political truce will last. If history, and the current state of polarized, angry politics, is any guide it wont be long, even with the best of hopes and intentions. With a special counsel narrowing in on the President, a contentious Obamacare repeal bill making its way through the Senate and a divisive budget and debt ceiling showdown looming, tensions are surely just on hold. And while rattled lawmakers and staffers on Capitol Hill instinctively drew together after the shooting, sitting together at the game, that doesnt mean their constituents and attack dogs in warring partisan media establishments will heed a moment of Beltway togetherness. Congressional baseball players: We must unite, We are dealing with a deeply entrenched, deeply ingrained system that has been perpetuated for a long time, so is it easy to change? No. But can we, of course we can, we just have to have the will to do it, Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick told CNNs Phil Mattingly. Plenty of members of Congress, shocked at what happened Wednesday morning at baseball practice in suburban Alexandria, Virginia, and deeply concerned about their own safety are now talking about the need to conduct political debate in a more civil way. Many connected the shooting rampage to the fearsome tone of current political rhetoric, since the shooter, James Hodgkinson, from Illinois, left   screeds on his social media page. The poisonous atmosphere in Washington and the polarization in our country causes warped, twisted minds to do terrible things, Maine Sen. Susan Collins told CNN on Thursday. Arizona Republican Rep. Martha McSally said that the rhetoric in the country had reached such levels that civil debate was all but impossible. Things are enflamed to such a hot point right now, she said, bemoaning the rhetoric, the hatred, the vitriol, the inability to have a discussion about sincerely held beliefs and debate them but not be disagreeable with each other. But is there any real reason to believe anything will change? After all, when normal politics resumes it will do so at one of the most contentious Washington moments in years. A new president, barely in office five months, could soon be under investigation by a special counsel Robert Mueller for obstruction of justice    and is furious about it. Should the investigation produce an impeachment drama, the nation will embark on the most traumatic national political process possible     considering whether to remove an elected President before his time.  However that ends, it will leave scars for years to come. Many people in the political world had quietly worried that violence was a lamentably possible extension of a presidential campaign in which Trump baited angry crowds and liberals ridiculed and insulted him. In a sign of how the political dialogue has deteriorated, its now normal for the President of the United States to spread obvious falsehoods, to brand the media the enemy of the American people and for his opponents to openly call him a liar. Now, it seems, even something as quintessentially American as playing baseball might require members of Congress to take along a phalanx of armed guards. Some members are now talking about arming themselves at public events. GOP rep regrets heated rhetoric, will carry firearm, Far from easing, the bile had been rising in recent months, challenging the barriers of political taste and convention. For instance, there was a controversy in which comedian Kathy Griffin posed with photos of a severed head mask in the likeness of President Trump.  Amid Griffin outrage, the left asks: What about Ted Nugent? And even as he offered a videotaped message of unity at Thursday nights baseball game, Trumps campaign sent out a fundraising email targeting Democrats. After their   election loss, all Democrats have done is OBSTRUCT President Trump and maniacally scream the word RUSSIA until theyre blue in the face, the email read. Theyve sparked protests in the streets, refused to approve White House nominees, destroyed our health care system, and used the media to spew vicious rhetoric against the President. Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi earlier pushed back hard at suggestions by some conservatives that left wing rhetoric was to blame for Wednesdays attack. I think that the comments made by my Republican colleagues are outrageous, beneath the dignity of the job that they hold, beneath the dignity of the respect that we would like Congress to command, she said. Later however, Pelosi appeared in more conciliatory mood in a joint interview with House Speaker Paul Ryan on CNN. Even the business of regular politics is laced with contention.  Senators may soon vote on a Republican health care bill that would repeal Obamacare, that opponents decry as ripping away coverage from the old, the sick and the poor. Emotions will run riot on both sides of the aisle. No one knows what the GOP health plan is, even Republicans, Before the fall, a new government funding crisis is expected which will fray tempers and will leave the good feelings of Thursday night a distant memory. And even as most of Washington avoided new battles Thursday out of deference to Scalise and the others injured, Trump was settling old scores, in a furious reaction to the widening scope of the Russia investigation. Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my   are? Trump wrote on Twitter. All the Presidents tweets, But while it is undeniable that Trump has added a contentious new note to Washington politics    the blame is not his alone.  In many ways he is the culmination of fury and resentment thats been boiling for years, fueled by contentious elections, partisan meltdowns in Washington and a balkanized media sector which often serves to solidify extremes of opinion.   In one sign of the acrimony, one of the most outspoken Republican flamethrowers, Steve King of Iowa, returned to a familiar target when assigning blame for the outrage at the baseball diamond in Alexandria. I do want to put some of this at the feet of Barack Obama, the Iowa congressman said in an interview with Simon Conway on WHO Iowa radio.  He contributed mightily to dividing us. He focused on our differences rather than our things that unify us. And this is some of the fruits of that labor. King was an exception. But the idea that a single violent incident, like Wednesdays, could change the political climate has been expressed after tragedies before    and been shown to be empty hope. Things didnt change after Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords was shot in 2011 at a political event in Tucson    though many people expressed hopes that they would. Back then, Obama delivered a heart searing eulogy to a little girl,   Green, who was just discovering a fascination with politics, but was killed at the Giffords event, hoping she was dancing in rain puddles in heaven. I want us to live up to her expectations, Obama said. I want our democracy to be as good as she imagined it. Everyone knows how that turned out. But despite that, there are still some optimists. Mark Kelly, Giffords husband, told CNNs Jake Tapper on Wednesday that acrid political rhetoric had consequences but change was not impossible. I think it can happen if people are really motivated to make it happen. it happened after what happened in Tucson for a little bit, Kelly said."
Threatening letter sent to congressional candidates home,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/16/2017,"(CNN) Suspicious envelopes were sent to the homes of Georgia Republican politician Karen Handel and her neighbors as well as two   news stations, law enforcement said. Law enforcement responded to the suburban Atlanta neighborhood Thursday afternoon after a resident reported receiving an envelope, Roswell Police spokeswoman Lisa Holland said. The envelopes contained threatening letters and white powder.  Later Thursday, news stations WAGA Fox 5 and WXIA 11Alive received similar envelopes, the FBI said. An investigation is underway to see if they are related. Preliminary field tests on the substance mailed to WAGA suggest the powder consisted mostly of baking soda, the FBI said. The FBI said the letter WAGA received was very similar to those received by those in Handels neighborhood.  Handel is the GOP candidate in Georgias closely watched, tightening 6th Congressional District special election against newcomer and Democrat Jon Ossoff. This afternoon we had some suspicious packages delivered to our house and to our neighbors. The packages contained threatening letters and a suspicious substance. The police were quickly notified and street is now being blocked off. We will continue to coordinate with law enforcement as necessary, she said on Facebook. The Postmaster General is also part of the investigation."
Feinstein is done pulling punches on Trump,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/16/2017,"(CNN) California Sen. Dianne Feinstein is uniquely situated at the center of the ongoing probe into Russias involvement in the 2016 election as she sits on both the Senate intelligence and judiciary committees. (She is the   Democrat on the judiciary committee.) Feinsteins centrality to all of this means that when she talks, we would do well to listen. Sen. Dianne Feinsteins rise: How one badass woman fought to keep going, And, man, did she have something to say Friday. Heres her full statement on President Donald Trumps latest tweets about the special counsel investigation being led by former FBI Director Bob Mueller: Im growing increasingly concerned that the President will attempt to fire not only Robert Mueller, the special counsel investigating possible obstruction of justice, but also Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein who appointed Mueller. The message the President is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnt apply to him and that anyone who thinks otherwise will be fired. Thats undemocratic on its face and a blatant violation of the Presidents oath of office. First of all, the President has no authority to fire Robert Mueller. That authority clearly lies with the attorney general   or in this case, because the attorney general has recused himself, with the deputy attorney general. Rosenstein testified under oath this week that he would not fire Mueller without good cause and that none exists. And second, if the President thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, hes in for a rude awakening. Even his staunchest supporters will balk at such a blatant effort to subvert the law. Its becoming clear to me that the President has embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light, be that Congress, the media or the Justice Department. The Senate should not let that happen. Were a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the President would be wise to learn. Just a few lines worth reading again: * The message the President is sending through his tweets is that he believes the rule of law doesnt apply to him. * If the President thinks he can fire Deputy Attorney General Rosenstein and replace him with someone who will shut down the investigation, hes in for a rude awakening. * Its becoming clear to me that the President has embarked on an effort to undermine anyone with the ability to bring any misdeeds to light. * Were a nation of laws that apply equally to everyone, a lesson the President would be wise to learn. Any one of those lines is a     fastball thrown way, way inside. Taken all altogether, its a statement very clearly designed to send a message to Trump.  That message? Enough! Time to start acting like a president. To be clear: Feinstein is a Democrat. She represents one of the most Democratic states in the country and risks absolutely nothing, politically speaking, by issuing a statement like this one that blisters Trump. But she is also one of the institutions in the Senate, having spent the last 25 years in the chamber. Unlike her longtime colleague Barbara Boxer, who retired in 2016, Feinstein is not seen as terribly partisan and generally enjoys strong    relationships.   Of his relationship with Feinstein, Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ) told Roll Call newspaper in February: Every conversation that Ive had with her now that shes ranking member has been not only friendly, but has been productive, and these little    that you see us having when the committees actually functioning, work things out right then. In short: Feinstein isnt just a predictable partisan or someone who pops off at the slightest political provocation. This statement is a purposeful attempt to make clear that Trump has crossed a line and that he needs to take one big step back. My prediction: He wont."
Opinion: Trump hires the wedding planner --  to oversee housing program?,CNN,Errol Louis,6/16/2017,"(CNN) According to a report in the New York Daily News, Donald Trump has appointed the spectacularly unqualified Lynne Patton to run the Region II office of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which covers New York and New Jersey    thus confirming the Trump administrations haphazard treatment of the problems facing American cities. Patton, who has been an event planner and personal aide to members of the Trump family (she planned Eric Trumps wedding) has no experience in housing or urban development. She will now be tasked with coordinating the flow of billions of federal dollars into New York City, Newark, Trenton and other troubled urban centers.  Her portfolio will include the nations largest public housing authority, home to more than half a million people, and the countrys largest Section 8 program, which provides subsidies to tens of thousands of   renters.   It remains unclear, to say the least, how well those responsibilities will be shouldered by a woman whose main credential appears to be her years of service to the Trump family. Pattons online LinkedIn biography describes her job as working for Eric Trump, Donald Trump, Jr. and Ivanka Trump, and handling all calendar appointments, scheduling, media appearances, travel, expenses, purchases, event coordination,   as well as home  business responsibilities. It did not help matters that, on a recent surprise visit to the New York City Housing Authority, Patton disappointed local officials by declining to actually enter a housing authority apartment. That echoes a similar decision by her boss, HUD Secretary Ben Carson, to avoid visiting city projects that rely on HUD funds.  None of this bodes well for public housing in New York, which could lose as much as $216 million in   federal housing money if Congress approves cuts proposed in the Trump administrations 2018 budget.   A more pressing concern for Patton will be the multiple    questions raised by her appointment. A recent Forbes investigation revealed that more than $1 million in funds from the Eric Trump Foundation    overseen by Patton    actually ended up in the coffers of the   Trump Organization, which collected inflated fees from the foundation for hosting charitable events at Trump golf courses.   A spokesman for Eric Trump called the report disgusting, adding Contrary to recent reports, at no time did the Trump Organization profit in any way from the foundation or any of its activities.  NY State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is examining the question, meaning Patton will enter office under a cloud.  Theres also an unrelated conflict issue in how Patton will handle her duty to regulate Spring Creek Towers, a vast,   complex in Brooklyn with nearly 6, 000 apartments that was built with federal help: in exchange for government financing, the owners of developments like Spring Creek agree to keep rents at a designated level that   tenants can afford.  Over the years, Donald Trump shed this type of   housing, but  the Trump Organization still owns 4% of Spring Creek Towers, worth an estimated $25 million    and the complexs ongoing subsidies are regulated by none other than HUD. One wonders what kind of oversight Patton can fairly exercise over the Trump Organization that has employed her for so long. Donald Trumps successful campaign for President was based on the idea that inspired amateurs from outside Washington can run the government better than government insiders. Patton will put that proposition to a   test, with the housing needs of hundreds of thousands hanging in the balance."
Northern Ireland peace at risk: UKs May warned against DUP deal,CNN,James Griffiths,6/16/2017,"(CNN) A deal to prop up British Prime Minister Theresa Mays government could come at the cost of peace in Northern Ireland, politicians have warned.  Speaking in London Thursday after a meeting with May, prominent Northern Irish politician and Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said he had told May she was in breach of the Good Friday Agreement     the peace treaty which ended 30 years of deadly sectarian violence known as The Troubles. Peace at risk, Following a bruising election result in which her Conservative Party squandered a   majority in Parliament and found itself struggling to form a government, May has attempted to form an alliance with the   Democratic Unionist Party. Under the Good Friday agreement, unionists and Irish republicans like Sinn Fein entered into a   government. The UK government, which at that point gave up direct rule over Northern Ireland, was intended to be a neutral arbitrator between the parties.  By forming a government with the DUP, many commentators have argued the Conservatives would undermine this arrangement and risk the peace process.  Theres a level of incompetence . .. and lack of understanding by this government on Northern Ireland that is very troubling, Peter Hain, former Labour Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, told CNN.  His comments echoed those of former Conservative Prime Minister John Major, who warned earlier this week that Mays actions put the fragile peace at risk.  A fundamental part of that peace process is that the UK government needs to be impartial between all the competing interests in Northern Ireland, he told the BBC. And the danger is that however much any government tries, they will not be seen to be impartial if they are locked into a parliamentary deal at Westminster with one of the Northern Ireland parties. The peace process, which was very hard earned over very many years by a lot of people, people shouldnt regard it as a given. It isnt certain, it is under stress. It is fragile, he said.  What were The Troubles?  More than 3, 600 people died in sectarian violence between 1968 and 1998 as unionist and republican terrorist groups carried out bombings, assassinations and other crimes.  The fighting had its roots in a   dispute between the UK and the Republic of Ireland over control over the northern part of the island.  Britain colonized the entirety of Ireland beginning in the 1600s, and it was incorporated into the UK in 1801. In 1920, guerrilla warfare between what became known as the Irish Republican Army (IRA) and unionists led to the partitioning of Northern Ireland and the future Republic of Ireland. Unionists are typically Protestants, who want to keep Northern Ireland as a part of the UK, while republicans are mostly Catholic and favor a united Ireland. Republicans in Northern Ireland, around 35% of the population at the time, did not accept the partition and some adopted armed struggle as a way to break away from the UK. Militant activity by the IRA and other republican groups sparked a rise in Unionist paramilitary and terrorist organizations, as well as a forceful and often brutal response by the British Army, which sent thousands of troops to occupy the country.  Bloody Sunday    a January 1972 shooting in Derry of 14 unarmed republican activists by the British Army    was a flashpoint in the conflict. In 1985, the IRA attempted to assassinate then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher with a   bomb planted at the hotel she and her cabinet were staying at in Brighton. Thatcher escaped injury, though five people were killed including a sitting Conservative MP. The IRA also carried out a   bombing campaign targeting major cities throughout the UK mainland, including deadly attacks in London and Birmingham.  Ceasefire negotiations began in the 1980s, eventually culminating in the Good Friday Agreement, which was negotiated by the governments of the UK, US and Ireland, as well as representatives of Northern Ireland groups.   Political chaos, Both Sinn Fein and the DUP have their roots in The Troubles.  Sinn Fein, a   liberation party modeled on similar movements in South Africa and the Palestinian territories, was originally formed as the political wing of the IRA. The DUP are a   Christian party founded by Protestant preacher Ian Paisley in 1971. The party has historical links to unionist paramilitary groups, and during the 2017 election campaign some of its candidates were endorsed by the Loyalist Communities Council, which is supported by several militant organizations.  Under the Good Friday Agreement, unionist and republican parties are supposed to form a   administration that governs Northern Ireland.  However, in January, Sinn Fein pulled out of the government over a corruption scandal involving DUP leader Arlene Foster, who is currently negotiating with May.  That has left the region without a government for five months. Sinn Fein and others have argued that any deal in which the DUP formed part of a UK government would worsen the current situation.  Rule over Northern Ireland is due to revert to London if parties fail to reach a deal on a   government, but what that means for the country if the DUP is a part of that government at Westminster remains to be seen."
Youd Be Surprised at How Many Foods Contain Added Sugar - The New York Times,New York Times,Margot Sanger-Katz,6/15/2017,"You may know theres added sugar in your Coke or cookies. But did you know that its in your salad dressing, pasta sauce and bread? The Food and Drug Administration came out Friday with its new template for nutrition labels. One big change was the addition of a line for added sugar, to be placed below a line for total sugar. The change is designed to distinguish between sugars that are naturally occurring in a food     like the milk sugar in a plain yogurt     and the sugars that food manufacturers include later to boost flavors     like the evaporated cane juice in a Chobani Kids strawberry yogurt. A team of researchers at the University of North Carolina conducted a detailed survey of the packaged foods and drinks that are purchased in American grocery stores and found that 60 percent of them include some form of added sugar. When they looked at every individual processed food in the store, 68 percent had added sugar. Some of those products are more obvious sugary foods, but not all. The list includes many sauces, soups, fruit juices and even meat products. You might think its easy to figure out whether the food manufacturer added sugar to your food, but it isnt always so. While some foods include sugar in their ingredients, many use different words for products that are nutritionally similar. Most of us have heard of   corn syrup, a sugar made from processing corn. But there are also things like the evaporated cane juice in the yogurt, and rice syrup and  which are less obvious and amount to the same thing. Barry Popkin, a professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina, and one of the papers authors, said that the wide variety of sugars is not always meant to confound consumers. Instead, he said, the many sugar types are chosen by food scientists to give their products the best flavor and texture. Some sugars are better for baked goods, while others are better in soft drinks. Some are also cheaper than others. Sugar tariffs and import laws make it expensive to bring in too much foreign sugar. But not all of the sugar formulations count toward the laws quotas. Theres also the matter of fruit juice concentrates, which are juices that have been stripped of nearly everything but sugar and evaporated. A lot of seemingly natural foods include ingredients like apple juice concentrate.  Thats sugar. That will be a lot clearer when the labels are updated. Its going to really surprise people who go to organic and whole foods stores, when they find that all this natural food theyve been buying is full of added sugar, Mr. Popkin said. Its full of fruit juice concentrates, and they thought it was all good stuff.  The emphasis on added sugar comes from new nutrition guidelines that urge Americans to consume a healthy dietary pattern containing certain types of foods. According to the regulation, hidden added sugars make it difficult to understand whether the food you are eating is part of that healthy pattern. Medical evidence shows that high sugar consumption is linked to obesity, diabetes and tooth decay     though not all of that work distinguishes between added sugar and total sugar. Many of the big food industry trade groups and lobbyists were satisfied with the new label rules, as my colleague Sabrina Tavernise recently wrote. But the sugar industry and the corn refiners are upset. Critics of the policy argue that the difference between natural and added sugars is not nutritionally meaningful, and that the science establishing health harms from added sugar is weak. The new label will kick in for large food companies in 2018, and for smaller companies a year later. The U. N. C. research used its master list of sugar code words to measure how many grocery store foods include sugar. But measuring the precise amount of sugars that are added with the current label is quite difficult. Mr. Popkin said consumers would be surprised by recent research from his team revealing the large amounts of added sugars in products that are generally thought of as healthy     foods like infant formula, protein bars and yogurt."
"As Trump Prepares Policy Shift, Human Rights Groups Clash with Pro-Cuba Interests - Breitbart",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/15/2017,"WASHINGTON, DC     President Donald Trump is expected to announce a restructuring of American policy towards Cuba in Florida on Friday. [Observers expect the Trump Cuba policy to roll back some of the measures former President Barack Obama put into place to allow more robust business cooperation with that countrys communist government.  Those rollbacks may include the reinstatement of some travel restrictions for U. S. citizens following a review by the National Security Council, multiple media outlets are reporting. Trump is expected to use tough rhetoric against the Cuban government in calling for tightening rules for U. S. travel to the country, the Washington Examiner reported on Tuesday. He is also expected to call for blocking commerce with entities that benefit the Cuban military.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Tuesday that Obamas Cuba policy has not changed the behavior of the regime in Cuba and its treatment of people.  Tillerson said that, in fact, the communist government may be the biggest benefactor of Obamas Cuba policy. Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) Executive Director Marion Smith said in a statement that she hopes the current administration will impose new restrictions against the communist dictatorship if the Cuban regime does not make the political reforms necessary to improve the lives of its citizens. Despite claims that detente with Cuba will lead to new freedoms for the Cuban people, an influx of capital and tourism has only further fueled the Castro governments repressive policies, Smith said. Despite assurances to the contrary, the past two years have witnessed only more government crackdowns and imprisonment of political dissidents and no steps toward improving Cubas abysmal human rights record.  President Trump should use this opportunity to push the Cuban government to release its political prisoners, allow for dissent, and adhere to international standards on human rights, Smith said. The Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation (VOC) is a     educational and human rights organization with a mission to commemorate the more than 100 million victims of communism around the world and to obtain freedom for those still living under totalitarian regimes. The number of arbitrary     and often violent     arrests of dissidents in Cuba for their political beliefs skyrocketed following the 2014 announcement from President Obama that he was willing to cooperate with the Castro regime. During Obamas visit to the island in 2016, the Cuban government arrested nearly 500 people for expressing   views in public. Meanwhile,   government media outlets reporting that lobbying and advocacy groups that benefit from Obamas policy have placed Trump under pressure to maintain normalization policies.   activist group Center for Democracy in the Americas (CDA) has urged the president to rethink his hitherto   stance on Americas former cold war foe, claiming that the cutting of improved relations would do nothing to help Cuban citizens or serve the U. S.s national interests, CNBC reported. A rollback of recent progress in U. S.  relations would be out of step with the views of the majority of the American public   both Republican and Democrat   and would threaten the significant gains reaped by the American people and the Cuban people since the restoration of U. S.  ties, CDAs Executive Director Emily Mendrala said on Tuesday. Trump will make his Cuba policy announcement on Friday in Miami."
Sarah Sanders: Congressional Baseball Game Provides Great Moment of Unity - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/15/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     Thursday nights Congressional baseball game is on     an event that White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Sanders called a great moment of unity. [Sanders said she was echoing the words of the President from the previous day, when there was hate   attack on the annual Republican charity baseball team practice.  In a Thursday afternoon White House press briefing, Sanders was asked who from the Trump Administration would be attending the game and Is there any other message to people that     the teams that are playing, players in the game? Sanders replied, I think, to kind of echo what the President said yesterday, I think this provides a great moment of unity to see members from both parties come out and have that time together, without conflict, on a baseball field, and enjoy a night like that.  After a gunman opened fire on a Republican baseball practice in Alexandria on Thursday, the President spoke to the American people from the White House. We may have our differences, but we do well in times like these to remember that everyone who serves in our nations Capitol is here because, above all, they love our country, said Trump. As to whom from the Administration would be attending, Sanders said, I believe there are several members from the administration that are planning to attend.  But as far as specifics, Im not sure of that right now.  Trump himself wont be attending the game due to security issues, but instead recorded a video message that was played at the game. President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump as well as Vice President Mike Pence and second lady Karen Pence have visited Rep. Steve Scalise and Capitol Police officer, Special Agent Crystal Griner at the hospital.  The other victims of the shooting were being treated at other area hospitals.

Pence hires outside counsel in Russia probe,CNN,Jeff Zeleny,6/15/2017,"Washington (CNN) Vice President Mike Pence has hired his own lawyer to represent him in the special counsel investigation and congressional inquiries into Russias role in the 2016 election. The lawyer, Richard Cullen, is a former Virginia attorney general and a former US attorney for the eastern district of Virginia. Pence interviewed several lawyers before selecting Cullen, who is based in Richmond. The decision to hire Cullen has been in the works for weeks, aides to the vice president said. It follows President Donald Trumps decision to assemble a team of outside lawyers to represent him through the Justice Department special counsels investigation of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. The vice president is focused entirely on his duties and promoting the Presidents agenda and looks forward to a swift conclusion of this matter, Jarrod Agen, the vice presidents communications director, said Thursday night in a statement. Cullen, reached by CNNs Kevin Bohn, Cullen said he had nothing to add beyond the official statement. The vice president made the final decision to hire Cullen earlier this week, an aide told CNN, and stressed that the decision to hire Cullen was not prompted by anything. Russia investigation, Pences hire comes just one day after The Washington Post reported Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating Trump for obstruction of justice. Mueller is reportedly interviewing three top intelligence officials    Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats, National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers and retired deputy NSA director Richard Ledgett     as part of the probe, as early as this week. In a tweet Thursday morning, Trump called the Posts report phony. They made up a phony collusion with the Russians story, found zero proof, so now they go for obstruction of justice on the phony story, he wrote. Nice. Pence, who after the election served as head of Trumps White House transition team, has stood by Trumps assertion that there are no ties between Trumps campaign and Russia. As has been stated repeatedly and the President has been told, hes not under investigation, Pence told reporters on Capitol Hill in May. There is no evidence of collusion between our campaign and any Russian officials. A senior administration adviser acknowledged there have been weeks of   behind closed doors among members of Pences team, and an acceptance that the questions about Russia and the Trump campaign were not disappearing. Pence has been under fire for not knowing a number of things that happened during the transition    which he led as chairman.  A number of Pence advisers and staff worked out of Trump Tower during the transition    and are now worried about being dragged into legal issues.  A senior administration adviser explained the nervousness: You just worry about some meeting or call that you were at and dont recall even innocuous in nature, and then you get pounced on. The adviser said that people on Pences staff have not lawyered up as far as this person knew but added, man, what a stressful deal. The adviser offered CNN a different version of why Pence was out of the loop during the transition: he was concerned with Senate confirmable personnel. The primary focus for Pence was Cabinet level, as the President had selected his senior staff, this person said. How hell pay, So how is the vice president going to pay for his new personal lawyer?   A Pence adviser told CNN the legal fees will be paid through   funds. The adviser declined to elaborate whether it would come out of Pences pocket    doubtful, given his modest net worth    or a campaign fund of some kind. The vice president recently opened a leadership PAC, the Great American Committee. He is having a fundraising event Friday night in Indianapolis. That may be one option. But the fees could also be paid through other avenues, ranging from the     committee or some type of Republican National Committee fund. Two Washington campaign finance lawyers said Thursday night the rules offer leeway when hiring outside legal representation. Bob Bauer, a Democratic lawyer whose practice includes advising clients on campaign finance issues, told CNN it would raise concerns if Pence used his leadership PAC to pay his legal fees. It is a problem if a committee is formed and money raised for the expressed purpose of supporting candidates and normal political activities, Bauer said, but the intention is in fact to establish a personal legal expense fund."
Trump makes hospital visit after congressional baseball shooting,CNN,Kevin Liptak,6/15/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made an evening visit to the hospital where a critically wounded US congressman is receiving treatment Wednesday. Accompanied by his wife, Trump arrived around sunset for the surprise visit to MedStar Washington Hospital Center. Rep. Steve Scalise, the number three House Republican, underwent surgery at the facility earlier Wednesday for wounds sustained in a shooting, which took place at a baseball practice just outside Washington on Wednesday morning. The couple brought two large bouquets of white flowers for the injured lawmakers wife, as well as for Crystal Griner, a US Capitol Police officer also wounded in the gun attack. Inside the facility, Trump sat next to Scalises bed and spoke with his family, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. He also spoke with Griner and her wife, as well as hospital doctors. A senior administration official said the mood inside the hospital was somber during Trumps visit, which came hours after Scalise emerged from surgery still in critical condition after suffering a single rifle shot to his hip. The President and first lady remained inside the hospital for about twenty minutes before returning to the White House. After Trumps visit, MedStar said Scalise, a Republican from Louisiana, had suffered injuries to internal organs and fractured bones during the shooting. He was administered multiple units of blood transfusions and will require additional operations, hospital representatives said. Trump brought with him to the hospital Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician, who had visited the center earlier in the day to ascertain Scalises condition from doctors there. In a subdued statement from the White House Wednesday morning, Trump called for unity across party lines after the shooting. He avoided issuing partisan blame for the attack, which was carried out by an assailant who had expressed anger at Trumps election and support for Democratic candidates. Its the first major domestic incident that has prompted a response from Trump, who spoke straight into the camera during his brief statement from the Diplomatic Reception Room. During his remarks, Trump disclosed that the shooter had died, the first confirmation from any official of the death. His appearance was shorter than his predecessors   statements, and did not contain political overtures, as President Barack Obamas reactions often did. But Trump did strike a similar tone of solemnity, which has become rare during his public appearances until this point. Everyone on that field is a public servant    our courageous police, our congressional aides who work so tirelessly behind the scenes with enormous devotion, and our dedicated members of Congress who represent our people, Trump said. We may have our differences, but we do well, in times like these, to remember that everyone who serves in our nations capital is here because, above all, they love our country."

I give him credit. All the time he was bleeding, we were under fire. He was texting    he was texting letting people know we were under fire and that we needed help. So, hes doing great. Vice President (Mike) Pence has spoken to him. Im grateful for that. Crystal Griner, Griner, 32, is also a Capitol Police special agent. In a statement, Capitol Police said Griner was in good condition in the hospital, having been shot in the ankle. David Bailey, Bailey is a Capitol Police special agent who is part of the congressional security detail.

Elizabeth Banks Calls Out Steven Spielberg for Sexist Casting,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/15/2017,"Update: Banks apologized for forgetting about Spielbergs film The Color Purple during her speech, in a statement posted to her Twitter account Thursday. [When I made the comments, I was thinking of recent films Steven directed, it was not my intention to dismiss the import of the iconic #TheColorPurple, she wrote.  pic. twitter.      Elizabeth Banks (@ElizabethBanks) June 15, 2017,  Those who have the privilege and honor of directing and producing films should be held to account for our mistakes, whether its about diversity or inaccurate statements. Im very sorry, she added. Original story below:   Elizabeth Banks called out legendary director Steven Spielberg in a speech at the Women in Film awards ceremony at the Beverly Hilton Hotel Wednesday, accusing Spielberg of never having cast a woman as a lead in a film in his   career. In an acceptance speech, Banks     who directed and starred in the 2015 sequel to the cult hit Pitch Perfect      reportedly discussed the lack of female representation in Hollywood and specifically   the        according to the Wrap. I went to Indiana Jones and Jaws and every movie Steven Spielberg ever made, and by the way, hes never made a movie with a female lead, Banks charged. Sorry, Steven. I dont mean to call your ass out but its true.  While most of Spielbergs films do appear to revolve around male leads, at least three have featured lead roles for women his first film, 1974s The Sugarland Express, which starred Goldie Hawn 1985s The Color Purple, which starred Oprah Winfrey and Whoopi Goldberg and last years The BFG, which starred child actor Ruby Barnhill. An upcoming film about the Pentagon Papers is set to star Meryl Streep as Washington Post publisher Kay Graham. Spielberg has also produced several titles with leading roles for women, including 2009s The Lovely Bones, starring Rachel Weisz, and 2005s Memoirs of a Geisha. The Wrap reported that an audience member pointed out The Color Purple to Banks, but she moved on in her speech. Banks     who is set to direct an upcoming reboot of Charlies Angels     was feted at the Women in Film event by former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, for whom she had campaign during the 2016 race. Clinton told the audience that she had not yet seen the superhero film Wonder Woman, but predicted she would enjoy it. Something tells me that a movie about a strong, powerful woman fighting to save the world from a massive international disaster is right up my alley, Clinton said.

Trump told the mayor of a disappearing island not to worry about sea-level rise  these photos show how grave the situation has become,Business Insider,Dana Varinsky,6/15/2017,"Twelve miles from either coast of the Chesapeake Bay sits a small island in danger of disappearing. Tangier Island, Virginia, is one of the most isolated and extraordinary places in the continental US. But the island sits 4 feet or so above sea level, and a  suggests that little of it will be left 50 years from now. President Donald Trump, however, disagrees.  that after Trump saw a CNN report about Tangier Island, the president called Mayor James Ooker Eskridge to tell him he shouldnt worry about a rise in sea levels. He said, Your island has been there for hundreds of years, and I believe your island will be there for hundreds more, Eskridge told The Daily Times. But Business Insider photographer Christian Storm visited Tangier Island in 2014, and his photos show how serious the problem has become there. Storm wrote a previous version of this story. Records indicate that in the   Tangier Island encompassed about 2, 060 acres. It was home to watermelon farms, grazing cows, and a variety of plant life. But since 1850, over 66% of Tangiers landmass has disappeared underwater. We have a pretty high degree of certainty that things are going to get wetter and wetter, Carlton Hershner Jr. a climate change scientist at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science,  in 2013. Not to be a bearer of bad news for Tangier, but that would suggest that sometime in the next 50 to 100 years the island would basically be underwater.  The island is reachable only by boat     its an     ferry ride from the coast. That keeps the place mostly closed off from the rest of the world. Some islanders go years without seeing the mainland, getting the supplies from the mail boat that arrives in the harbor every day. But being a waterman is becoming increasingly difficult. In an effort to prevent overfishing, Virginia placed a moratorium on new crabbing licenses, and other restrictions have also reduced the length of fishing seasons. You dont have to worry about traffic jams and murders, child molesters, rapists, and thieves, Laird said. You can leave your doors open. You dont have to lock anything.  Laird and other island natives share a thick accent thats equal parts Southern twang and Irish brogue. Vowels are extended to multiple syllables, making certain words hard to understand for outsiders. Tangiers  Laird said. Its a nice place, and everythings reasonable here.  Today, the Uppards has almost succumbed to the rising water levels, turning into a swampy wetland. Major portions are submerged, reachable only by skiff. A solitary dilapidated mobile trailer on the beach is one of the only signs that humans ever lived there. Laird recalled playing with his friends in the Uppards and hunting ducks there with his father. But despite the stark scene, he doesnt seem worried. The island aint goin nowhere, Laird said. They talk about erosion, but its been here forever, and it aint gone nowhere in forever.  Legend has it that John Crockett     still a common surname on the island     was the first to inhabit Tangier full time when he arrived with his eight sons in 1686. The island shuts down every Sunday morning and once denied Hollywood filmmakers permission to shoot the   Kevin Costner movie Message in a Bottle there because of the scripts mentions of swearing, sex, and drinking. Tangier is dry; booze is unavailable for purchase. Id like to be able to do this for the rest of my life, said Lairds    son, Nick. Its kind of scary to think you might not be able to."
California Man Arrested for Posting Deadpool Movie on Facebook - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,6/15/2017,"Trevon Maurice Franklin, from Fresno, California, was arrested Tuesday by federal agents for posting the entirety of Deadpool on Facebook while it was still being shown in movie theaters. [Variety reported that according to law enforcement officials, more than 5 million people viewed the film uploaded by Franklin, who went by the screen name of   M. King after he uploaded it to the social media platform around eight days after it premiered on February 12 last year. It is unclear how long his pirated version was up on Facebook before it was taken down.  The arrest came after a federal grand jury produced an indictment alleging he reproduced and distributed a copyrighted work the decision was based on an investigation by the FBI. Assistant United States Attorneys Ryan White and Vicki Chou, of the Department of Justices Cyber and Intellectual Property Crimes Section will be the ones prosecuting the case against Franklin. Coincidentally, a group of 30 entertainment companies has announced an   coalition, designed to help tackle copyright infringement online and suing anyone caught doing so. Some of those involved include Disney, Netflix, Warner Brothers, NBCUniversal, and Amazon. Deadpool was one of the smash hits of early 2016, grossing $363 million at the US box office. Its titular star, Ryan Reynolds, had revealed that he wanted to make it for years after appearing as a version of the character in   Origins: Wolverine. Test footage that leaked online spurred on great excitement from fans, convincing executives to push forward with the film.

ESPNs Kellerman: NFL Is Injecting Politics by Playing the National Anthem at Games - Breitbart,Breitbart,Trent Baker,6/15/2017,"Thursday, ESPN First Take   Max Kellerman shared his reaction to Seattle Seahawks defensive lineman Michael Bennett comparing free agent quarterback Colin Kaepernick to boxing legend Muhammad Ali.  Kellerman admitted the two athletes are very different, but said the two are similar in that neither went out looking for a protest.  The ESPN personality then argued that Kaepernick did not inject politics into the NFL, but rather the NFL injects politics by playing the national anthem and putting pressure on people to stand. Partial transcript as follows: They both were asked to do things that went against their conscience. In this country, in the United States of America, you dont have to do that. We are free to make our own choices. And if our conscience is bothering us, we can follow that. In Muhammad Alis case, he was asked to take a step forward and become a part of the Vietnam War, and he was against it on religious and moral and ethical principles, and he refused to take the step and he faced five years jail time but was ultimately vindicated in a Supreme Court case. OK, but he did have his prime stripped, his license revoked and he couldnt earn a living for four years, all that. Colin Kaepernick also did not go looking for a protest. It came to him. He was asked to stand for the national anthem. You do not have to stand for the national anthem. And even if it it was a rule that you did, is that Colin Kaepernick injecting politics in the NFL? No. Thats the NFL injecting politics by playing the national anthem and putting pressure on you to stand for it in the first place. Follow Trent Baker on Twitter @MagnifiTrent"
GOP Rep Sanford: Trump Partially to Blame for Environment That Led to Alexandria Shooting - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/15/2017,"Thursday on MSNBCs Morning Joe, Rep. Mark Sanford ( ) weighed in on Wednesdays shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that resulted in Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) in critical condition at a hospital in Washington, DC.  Sanford said we were at an inflection point and we needed to return to civility, or wind up in a very, very bad spot.  Indeed, were at an inflection point, Sanford said. There are forces at play Ive never seen before in roughly the 20 years Ive been involved in politics. Joe and I came in together way back when. And it is indeed different. I think we have to watch out as a society because if we dont watch out, civility is indeed a part of civilized government and an open political system. And if you let these forces play out, I think we end up at a very, very bad spot. I think what happened yesterday was symptomatic of it.  He went on to blame President Donald Trump in part for the toxic climate that led to this shooting. [I] would argue that the president is at least in partially     not in any way totally     but partially to blame for demons that have been unleashed, whether it is what I saw at a senior center back home and people saying,     and   to each other at a senior center, a retirement center and see each other play croquet the next day, or with what happened     not with what happened yesterday, but the fact that you know, youve got the top guy saying, Well, I wish I could hit you in the face.

Nancy Pelosi: Republicans Being Sanctimonious About Colleague Getting Shot by Partisan - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/15/2017,"Thursday at her weekly news conference, when asked about negative discourse playing a role in the shooting of Republicans practicing for a congressional charity baseball game, which critically injured House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) said Republicans began the current level of coarse political rhetoric attacking President Bill Clinton in the 1990s.  She then pointed to   Donald Trump joking at a campaign rally, I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldnt lose voters.  Pelosi said, Lets all say, lets examine our conscience, lets see how we can rid ourselves of our negative attitudes that go to a place that is like this. Weve had   it didnt use to be this way. Somewhere in the 1990s, Republicans decided on the politics of personal destruction as they went after the Clintons and that is the provenance of it and is what has continued. Again, I feel as if were having a family moment that is very, very serious and were talking about things that we can say, the discussion   save the discussion for another day. When you have a president that says I can shoot somebody on 5th Avenue and nobody would care, when you have people saying beat them up and Ill pay their legal fees, when you have all the assaults that are made on Hillary Clinton, for them to be so sanctimonious is something. I really am almost sad that I had to go down this path with you, because I dont think its appropriate for us to have the fullest discussion of it. And it will be for another day.

The most important takeaway from Jeff Sessions testimony was what he refused to say  and legal experts say Congress should subpoena him for answers,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/15/2017,"There was a lot Jeff Sessions couldnt quite guarantee Tuesday.     The attorney general  in his blockbuster hearing   that he couldnt recall a particular detail. That was in   addition to eight instances in which he did not know the   answer to a question posed by a member of the panel, five   instances in which he did not believe, four times he did   not think, and twice each that he did not have or remember   what the senator in question was looking for.     So naturally, the most important takeaway  was not  its   what he did not say.     On several occassions, Sessions refused to answer questions   related to his private conversations with President Donald Trump,   including conversations about FBI Director James Comeys   firing, the possibility of presidential pardons for Trump   associates, and whether Trump had expressed frustration with   Sessions   recusal from any   investigations involving the Trump campaign. If these   conversations did occur, they could be central to a possible      case.     Sessions rationale for his refusal to detail such conversations   was his duty to protect confidential communications hes had   with the president and a longstanding Department of Justice   practice not to disclose such information.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and   National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers gave similar   explanations before the Senate Intelligence Committee.     Several senators zeroed in on that explanation     Democratic Sens.   Martin Heinrich of New Mexico and Kamala Harris of California and   Independent Sen. Angus King of Maine     in their lines of   questioning, hammering the attorney general on the legitimacy of   his rationale. The center of their argument was simple: the   president had not invoked executive privilege, Sessions could not   on his own invoke executive privilege, so how could Sessions not   answer the questions?     Youre impeding this investigation, Heinrich said. So my   understanding of the legal standard is that you either answer the   question. Thats the best outcome. You say this is classified,   cant answer it here. Ill answer it in closed session. Thats   bucket number two. Bucket number three is to say Im invoking   executive privilege.  There is no appropriateness bucket. It is   not a legal standard.     Sessions said it would be inappropriate to do so without giving   Trump the chance to review whether he wanted to invoke executive   privilege, a position that a number of legal experts told   Business Insider would not pass muster if Congress really wanted   to push the White House. And when pressed on the specifics of the   Justice Department policy he was citing to sidestep some of the   senators questions, Sessions could not answer much at all.     Can you tell me what are these   DOJ rules that   protect conversations made in the executive without invoking   executive privilege? Heinrich asked, later repeating the   question a second time. Can you share those policies with us?   Are they written down at the Department of Justice?     I believe they are, Sessions responded.     Sessions could not, however, detail the particulars of the   supposed DOJ policy he was referring to.     Harris asked about the   policy, which Sessions   said goes beyond just the attorney general.     Is that policy in writing somewhere? Harris asked.     I think so, Sessions repsonded.        Legal experts who spoke to Business Insider said Sessions has   essentially invented a brand new privilege and, if the   administration is able to have its officials continue to use this   rationale during testimony, it would lead to a code of executive   silence.     Sessions rationale was completely lacking in any legal basis,   Adam Winkler, a law professor at UCLA, told Business Insider in   an email.     There are privileges, such as executive privilege and the   privilege against   but Sessions was clear that   he was not invoking these well established rights, he continued.   Instead, he was asserting some brand new privilege of his own   invention, with no legal support whatsoever. The question is when   will Republicans in Congress stand up to the president and stop   this lawlessness.     Robert Chesney, a University of Texas law professor and a     of the Lawfare blog, said he was unsure of what   Sessions has in mind with his explanation.     Barring a claim of executive privilege, its unclear how any   mere departmental policy position would cut any ice when Congress   seeks testimony from an executive branch official, he told   Business Insider in an email.     Congress options in this matter are simple, experts said.     Congress can subpoena Sessions to answer the questions members   laid out. That would essentially force the White Houses hand to   either invoke executive privilege, and possibly go to court over   whether the invocation was proper, or decide against invoking   privilege, in which case Sessions could be held in   contempt of Congress if he chose not to answer.     Democrats such as Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon and Rep. Adam Schiff   of California have already started homing in on that strategy   following the testimony.     Republican Sen. Richard Burr, chairman of the Senate Intelligence   Committee, concluded the hearing by asking Sessions if he could   go back and work with the White House to see if he can provide   answers to any questions to the committee in writing if there   are any areas of questions that they feel comfortable with you   answering, which is far from signaling the potential for a   subpoena.     As Alan Dershowitz, the renowned attorney and professor emeritus   at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider in an email,   Congress can compel Sessions to answer the questions and   override any Justice Department policy, so long as privilege has   not been invoked. He added that Trump would have to invoke   executive privilege if Congress were to subpoena Sessions for the   questions.     But Jed Shugerman, a law professor at Fordham University, said he   believes its too late for Trump to invoke executive privilege,   adding that he would argue Trump has already waived his right to   invoke.     Because President Trump was on notice for all of these questions   when Comey appeared, he told Business Insider. President Trump   failed to invoke the privilege in time for Comey. I could make   arguments that he waived it anyway. The fact is that President   Trump was on ample and obvious notice for all of these questions   Sessions was asked. And by failing to invoke it before 2:30 p. m.   he has permanently waived his privilege on these questions. So   you cant go back, you can unring the bell.     The rationale that it could be invoked at any time, it can be   invoked unilaterally by the official without the president is an   improper reading of executive privilege doctrine, he said, adding   that Sessions was incoherent and had no arguments to defend   his refusal to answer.     He had ample time to prepare for this, and he was incoherent,   and he did not give competent answers to the legal questions that   everyone knew he would have, Shugerman said.        Citing the exchanges with King, Harris, and Heinrich, Shugerman   said Sessions had exposed himself by failing to give effective   answers to explain his position.     Whats really was stunning was its obvious that this question   was going to be one of the central questions of todays   hearings, he said. And so for the attorney general to appear   and talk about DOJ policy in this completely ambiguous way,   completely opened himself up to Kamala Harris excellent   questions.     The idea that executive privilege exists out there in a floating   way to be invoked at some point in the future, it makes executive   silence become the policy, he added. Because at some point in   the next three and a half years, Trump might decide to invoke it,   thus any executive official can just decide on their own to   refuse to answer questions would turn the privilege into a   permanent executive code of silence because it could be invoked   one day. That is baseless. And absurd.     Shugerman said that, in addition to issuing a written subpoena,   the committee can invite Sessions to provide the answers in a   closed session. The professor added that other committees     such   as the Senate Judiciary Committee     can subpoena Sessions to give   answers to the same questions.     And on top of all that, there is special counsel Robert Muellers   investigation. The former FBI director is likely to ask Sessions   similar questions under oath in the course of the probe. That   probe is now likely looking into possible obstruction of justice   on Trumps part, as Comeys testimony from a week earlier alluded   to.     So, anyone who thinks Sessions survived and it is over, that   misunderstands how many other steps there are, Shugerman said.   The   are problematic.     Other experts said that Sessions was behaving in a way that is   consistent with the way the executive branch has traditionally   viewed executive privilege, noting that there is a longstanding   dispute between Congress and the executive branch on executive   privilege doctrine. Because Trump had not invoked privilege ahead   of time, officials like Sessions, Coats, and Rogers enter these   hearings with a really bad hand, Andrew Wright, former   associate counsel to President Barack Obama and Vice President Al   Gore, told Business Insider.     Wright, now a professor at Savannah Law School, said that   President Ronald Reagans   memo lays out some of what   Sessions was arguing before the committee. In a traditional   fight, Wright said Congress would then subpoena Sessions for the   answers.     Were at the white hot public intensity moment, but none of the   other steps have been taken, right? Wright said. Sessions came   in on a volunteer basis, he hasnt been threatened with contempt.   But make no mistake about it, every other dispute in the past,   Congress has been saying youve committed a crime the whole time   by not answering.     Wright, whos been on the other side of the aisle in instances   such as the Operation Fast and Furious ordeal and former Attorney   General Eric Holder being subpoenaed by Congress for documents   related to it, said Congress needs to enforce its prerogatives   here.     If Congress wants this information, by all means, criticize away   about the executive branch not having its act together, he said.   But youve got to subpoena this information, and youve got to   threaten contempt if you dont get it. Because otherwise, youre   going to let the executive branch away without giving a   legitimate legal position and allowing these witnesses to just   have to suffer through awkwardness but not actually come to   grounds.     But former assistant US Attorney and CNN senior legal analyst   Jeffrey Toobin doubts that the Republicans will see any benefit   in issuing those subpoenas.     You wont have these members going to court to get these   administration officials to testify on these conversations with   the president, he said on CNN Tuesday night. I think thats the   end of the matter.  There was a lot Jeff Sessions couldnt quite. .."

"Review: That Sunset Boulevard Close-Up, Finely Focused - The New York Times",New York Times,Ben Brantley,6/15/2017,"The scenery may have shrunk, but that face     oh, that face     looms larger than ever. So does the ego that animates it, both indomitable and irreparably broken. With one look, indeed, to borrow a song lyric that describes such unsettling presence. That outrageous,    desperate old lady shedding sanity on the stage of the Palace Theater still has the poetry in her gaze to break every heart. Yes, Hollywoods most fatally narcissistic glamour girl, Norma Desmond, is back in town, in the   revival of Andrew Lloyd Webbers Sunset Boulevard that opened on Thursday night. It is a show that exists almost entirely to let its star blaze to her hearts content. The light she casts is so dazzling, this seems an entirely sufficient reason to be. Miss Desmond is embodied by Glenn Close, the   movie actress who won a Tony in the same part 22 years ago. And what was one of the great stage performances of the 20th century has been reinvented, in terms both larger and more intimate, that may well guarantee its status as one of the great stage performances of this century, too. Ms. Close is even better than when I first saw her     more fragile and more frightening, more seriously comic and tragic. Part of this presumably involves the insights an artist accumulates over the decades. It is also to Ms. Closes advantage that she is no longer required to compete with an elephantine,   set. For this latest incarnation of Sunset Boulevard, directed by Lonny Price and first seen in London last year, is a close cousin to the   productions from Encores! of vintage musicals in concert at City Center. As in such presentations, the orchestra (40 pieces strong) is onstage and visible. James Noones set, anchored by tiered industrial scaffolding, conjures 1950s Hollywood through suggestive visual accents     a giant chandelier here, a floating corpse there     rather than   scenery. Yes, a car still shows up onstage. And our Miss Desmond still gets a workout walking up and down the stairs. But the   opulence of John Napiers original designs has been scrubbed away. Such relative minimalism allows us to see Norma and Sunset Boulevard plain. The good news is that Norma has never looked bigger. (And no, Im not forgetting about Gloria Swanson, who immortally created the part in the 1950 Billy Wilder film on which this show is based.) The musical, on the other hand, seems and sounds thin, despite the velveteen lushness of its excellent orchestra. Don Black and Christopher Hamptons book is just fine when it hews to the   dialogue of the original screenplay. But Sunset, being a musical, spends most of its time singing, and Mr. Black and Mr. Hamptons lyrics have a way of turning   cynicism into taunting schoolyard jingles, with rhymes that land as emphatically as children on hopscotch squares. (You know Im right.  Its there in black and white. ) Mr. Lloyd Webbers music often inhabits a similar zone of singsong insistence, with certain melody lines repeated so often you fear surgery may be necessary to have them removed from your memory. Only the swirling, ominous overtures evoke the shades of noir of Franz Waxmans original film score. For long stretches, you may even forget youre inhabiting one of the darkest visions that Hollywood ever summoned of itself. This is a story, after all, that begins with a talking dead man. Thats Joe Gillis, the    screenwriter who narrates in sustained flashback. On the lam from a collection agency, Joe (Michael Xavier) winds up in a scary old mansion at 10086 Sunset Boulevard, playing editor, house pet and eventually lover to the reclusive Miss Desmond, a nearly forgotten   diva, who is planning her comeback. We also spend far too much time with Joe in the less exotic world of Hollywood hopefuls, where he falls for an ambitious studio worker, Betty Schaeffer (Siobhan Dillon) his best friends girl. Betty, to put it bluntly, is a bore, and so is Joe when hes with her, since she has the effect of making them both sing like sweethearts out of Victor Herbert. Mr. Xavier is glib, handsome and charmingly  . But hes lightweight, lacking the tortured conscience that William Holden brought to Wilders movie. Fred Johanson, looking like Lurch from The Addams Family, finds more substance and shadow as Max, Normas fanatically loyal  . The large ensemble, choreographed into flailing friskiness by Stephen Mears, is serviceable. But were just marking time until Normas back. Whenever she makes an entrance, the adrenaline that surges through the house is palpable. Swathed in   ensembles of sequined black, shimmering gold and assorted animal prints (the great Anthony Powell did Ms. Closes costumes) her face as white and exaggeratedly expressive as Marcel Marceaus, Norma should by rights be merely a drag queens fantasy. And, yes, on one level, the lady is a camp. But Ms. Close deploys the declarative physical vocabulary of   acting to convey a genuine grandeur of spirit and an equally outsize force of will. Watch Norma watching herself onscreen in a state of mimetic rapture, or seesawing violently between little girl coquettishness and iron imperiousness with her captive lover. The audacity of this performance is matched by its veracity. This is   acting of a singularly sophisticated and disciplined order, one of those rare instances in which more is truly more. Her singing voice is reedy and at times  . But her delivery, her stance, her very presence are operatic in the richest sense of the word. I wont even try to describe the brilliant spiderlike dance     superhuman and pathetically human     with which Ms. Close concludes the show. You have to (and I mean have to) see it in person. Her interpretation of the shows one great song, As If We Never Said Goodbye, in which Norma visits her old studio lot, is a  . Watching it from its beginning (when a set worker trains a spotlight on Normas face) to its end (when she steps to the edge of the stage to absorb the applause like an unquenchable sponge) is to understand with all your senses the addictiveness of stardom. Feel the magic in the making, sings Norma. You can only nod your head in   agreement."
New York Times Corrects Fake News Editorial Blaming Sarah Palin for Shooting - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/15/2017,"The New York Times issued an online correction Thursday to its lead editorial, which claimed that Sarah Palin had incited Jared Loughner to commit the mass shooting in Tucson, Arizona, in 2011 that killed six and wounded Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ). [The editorial was a response to the shooting Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, in which gunman James T. Hodgkinson targeted Republican members of Congress at a baseball practice. Four players were wounded, including Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) who remains in the hospital in critical condition.  Originally, the Times article, Americas Lethal Politics, had stated: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palins political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. It also added that theres no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack in Wednesdays shooting. As Breitbart News explained Wednesday evening, after the editorial was published online, all of the Times factual claims above were false. Now, the article reads: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl. At the time, we and others were sharply critical of the heated political rhetoric on the right. Before the shooting, Sarah Palins political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. But in that case no connection to the shooting was ever established. A correction now appears at the bottom of the article: Correction: June 15, 2017 An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords.

Mother of American Held Hostage in Venezuela Hopeful Following Otto Warmbier Release - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/15/2017,"The mother of an American man wrongfully imprisoned in Venezuela says she is hopeful the Trump administration may soon secure the release of her son after the return of    student Otto Warmbier to the United States this week from North Korea. [[Warmbiers release] means that the administration is working hard on these cases, Laurie Holt told Fox News. Anything they can do to further the process along would be great because if we dont get him out soon, I dont think well see him alive again.   Holts comments come after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced that North Korean authorities had released Warmbier, despite having sentenced the student to 15 years of hard labor for hostile acts after stealing   propaganda signs from his hotel. Warmbier had reportedly fallen into a coma in March 2016, shortly after his arrest, and U. S. officials demand his release on humanitarian grounds, which Pyongyang conceded. In a press briefing on Wednesday, Deputy White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said that securing Warmbiers release had been a big priority for the president.  Joshua Holt, a former Mormon missionary from Utah, was arrested in Venezuela last June along with his wife Thamara Caleo after officials claimed to have found a small weapons arsenal in their apartment. They remain imprisoned despite eyewitnesses revealing they had seen police planting the weapons beforehand. In December, Venezuelan authorities repeatedly denied Holts attorney the right to see him, as prosecutors pressed charges against him and Caleo for terrorism and illegal possession of arms. According to a report from the Miami Herald earlier this week, President Donald Trump has now taken a personal interest in his case. The report also noted that Holt has become depressed and angry in prison and has no hope whatsoever that he will ever be free from there.  Since entering the jail, Holts health has significantly deteriorated, having lost 50 pounds and developing kidney stones, bronchitis, and internal bleeding, with his family claiming his life is at risk. The hardest part for me is that he told his    to tell me to go on with my life and forget about him because he feels like he is never going to get out, Laurie Holt said. But Im not going to do that.  She also says her son has been routinely tortured by Venezuelan authorities, who force him to perform gym exercises naked in the prisons hallways, which required Holt to violate Mormon practices of modesty around others. Venezuela enjoys alliances with some of Americas most vocal enemies, including the rogue nations of North Korea and Iran, who have routinely imprisoned Americans in search of government ransoms. North Korea is currently holding three U. S. citizens following Warmbiers release. Iran is holding at least two U. S. citizens, while a third disappeared in the country years ago. The Trump administration has prioritized securing the release of U. S. prisoners abroad. So far, at least two such detentions have successfully concluded: American businesswoman Sandy   who the Chinese government accused of spying, and Aya Hijazi, an American aid worker freed from Egypt after she was cleared of child abuse and human trafficking charges.

"FBI: 33,000 Criminal Gangs, 1.4 Million Members Active in U.S.",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/15/2017,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) website content devoted to criminal gangs operating in the United States includes staggering figures about these groups presence and criminal activities across the country. [Some 33, 000 violent street gangs, motorcycle gangs, and prison gangs with about 1. 4 million members are criminally active in the U. S. and Puerto Rico today, the FBI reports. Many are sophisticated and well organized all use violence to control neighborhoods and boost their illegal   activities, which include robbery, drug and gun trafficking, prostitution and human trafficking, and fraud.   Many gang members continue to commit crimes even after being sent to jail, the FBI reports. The 1. 4 million figure for the number of gang members is as big or bigger than four of the Top 10 largest cities in the U. S.     San Antonio, Texas, 1. 3 million San Diego, California, 1. 3 million Dallas, Texas, 1. 1 million and San Jose, California, 945, 942. The FBI has numerous entities working to combat the gang problem, including the Safe Streets Task Forces, the National Gang Intelligence Center, and Transnational   Task Forces. The NGIC, established by Congress in 2005, integrates gang intelligence from across federal, state, and local law enforcement on the growth, migration, criminal activity, and association of gangs that pose a significant threat to the U. S.  That intelligence reveals that the Mara Salvatrucha ( ) and 18th Street gangs continue to expand their influence in the United States, while transnational (operating across national borders) gangs are present in almost every state and continue to grow their memberships, now targeting younger recruits more than ever before.  The FBIs transnational   task forces operate in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, according to the FBI website. President Donald Trump said in April that his administration is cracking down on violent gangs operating in the U. S. They are getting the hell out or they are going to prison, Trump said in an interview with Fox and Friends. Trump praised Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly for enforcing the laws. I will tell you we have gotten tremendous criminals out of this country, Trump said. So many towns and cities are thanking me because we have gotten rid of a burden that you would not believe, he said. Texas Gov. Greg Abbott announced in April the expansion of the Texas   Task Force (TAG) and the creation of a technical operations center in response to a sharp increase in rape and murder in the Houston area by violent gangs. Abbott and Texas Department of Public Safety Director Steve McCraw singled out   and its connection to human smuggling, drug trafficking, murder, and rape during the announcement. This recent wave of senseless violence cannot continue, Abbott told reporters at a press conference attended by Breitbart Texas. Governments foremost responsibility is to keep our citizens safe and secure, Abbott said. Texas will take action and use all lawful means to put an end to this lawlessness."
Capitol Police Officer Henry Cabrera Who Stopped Alexandria Shooter Is an Army Veteran,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,6/15/2017,"Special Agent Henry Cabrera, a third Capitol Police officer who helped stop the massacre of GOP congressmen and their staff during baseball practice in Alexandria, VA, on Wednesday, went mostly overlooked. [Media attention primarily focused on hero Capitol Police officers David Bailey and Crystal Griner, who were wounded as they fired back at the gunman, James T. Hodgkinson.  But a third police officer, Henry Cabrera, who was also there at the time to protect House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) also helped take down the shooter, but was not wounded. Cabrera appears to be a U. S. Army veteran, according to his Facebook page. His page features a picture of himself in fatigues, and another of an Army platoon at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, on Sept. 12, 1994. The unit is the 2nd Battalion, 39th Infantry Regiment. Asked to confirm whether he is a veteran, Capitol Police Spokeswoman Eva Malecki responded, We cant comment any further on an ongoing investigation.  However, a relative of Cabrera confirmed to Breitbart News that he is a veteran. Cabreras name became known to the public after Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa thanked him, Griner, and Bailey at a press conference on Wednesday. I want to commend Special Agents Crystal Griner, David Bailey, and Henry Cabrera for their heroic and appropriate response in protecting the Members and others today during their practice for the Congressional baseball game, he said. Cabrera posted on Facebook on Wednesday after the shooting: Yesterday was   NUTS! !!! Many thanks to those who reached out to me yesterday. Im proud of my TEAMMATES David Bailey and Crystal Griner. They took care of business! !!!! Prayers for Mr Scalise and his family.  Supportive comments poured into Cabreras page and on Twitter. Dont sell yourself short man. You are one of the heroes too! a friend posted. There was a third officer there who should also be recognized. He just wasnt wounded. Special Agent Henry Cabrera.

Bailey, Griner, and an aide to Rep. Roger Williams ( ) Zach Barth, was also wounded. Those who were on the field that day credited the officers for saving their lives. Eyewitnesses said the officers stepped forward, towards the shooter, and saved everyones lives. It could have easily been 25 deaths or more, Williams said. The thin blue line held today. And Americans everywhere should be thankful that its still the kind of country that produces these heroes.  Without the Capitol Police, who literally took a step forward        they saved all of us out there. There is no question about it. We had no arms, all we had were bats. And the shooter, he added. Rep. Brad Wenstrup ( ) an Iraq veteran, said that after Hodgkinson fired at them with a rifle, he came out from behind a building with a pistol. Thats when security detail was able to take him down, he told ABC News. You never expect a baseball field in America to feel like being back in a combat zone in Iraq, but this morning it did, Wenstrup tweeted later. Sen. Rand Paul ( ) who was also there at the scene, said it would have been a massacre without the Capitol Police. I can tell you, that I think with absolute certainty, nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill Police. They saved everybodys life, he said. It would have been a massacre without them."
Bob Dylan Accused of Lifting Parts of Nobel Prize Speech from SparkNotes,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/15/2017,"Rock and folk legend Bob Dylan has been accused of lifting sections of his 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature acceptance speech from a SparkNotes. com summary of Moby Dick. [Andrea Pitzer, a contributor for Slate, wrote that Dylans speech last week included plagiarized lines from an abridged summary of Moby Dick, the Herman Melville novel that the Blowin in the Wind singer has cited as a personally inspiring text.  One of the phrases used in the lecture, Pitzer writes, matches wording found on SparkNotes     a study guide website that provides summaries of literature and other texts     but is not, however, in the classic novel. From the lecture: Some men who receive injuries are led to God, others are led to bitterness From SparkNotes: someone whose trials have led him toward God rather than bitterness.  Pitzer highlights at least 20 examples from Dylans lecture of sentences and phrases that are similar to those found in the SparkNotes summary of the novel. The Nobel Foundation awarded Dylan the prestigious prize in October, which sparked considerable controversy over the very definition of literature, and and the enigmatic music legend didnt acknowledge the honor for weeks. The musician declined to attend Decembers Nobel ceremony in Stockholm, citing scheduling issues. The Swedish Academy, which delivers the Nobel Prize, published Dylans speech on June 5, in the form of a   recording, and called it extraordinary and eloquent in a press release. The organization has not responded to the accusations. While Dylan has not responded to the accusations, however, he has been accused of borrowing phrases from other artists in the past. It is nothing new that Mr. Dylan might take inspiration from a   work to prepare something else, Steven Weinberg, a copyright lawyer and musician, told the Associated Press. Songwriters, including Dylan, have been borrowing from other literary works to turn pop phrases for ages. Consider Led Zeppelins ample use of Tolkiens classic works in many of their songs.  The surprise here is that rather than borrowing from classic literature, Mr. Dylan took his inspiration this time from crib notes, Weinberg said. But that should not raise eyebrows either. Even John Lennon was known to use things as ordinary as a newspaper clipping or circus posters to embellish lyrics.

"Donald Trump: Steve Scalise in Trouble Hes Going to Be Okay, We Hope",Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/15/2017,"President Donald Trump told reporters that House Majority Whip Steve Scalises condition had worsened since surgery after he was shot and wounded at a congressional baseball practice on Wednesday. [Its been much more difficult than people even thought at the time, Trump said solemnly at the White House. Its been     hes in some trouble. Hes a great fighter, and hes going to be okay, we hope.   The president said he visited Scalise at the hospital and told the family that the entire country was praying for him. He commented that Scalises tragedy may have brought some unity to the partisan climate in the country. Steve, in his own way, may have brought some unity to our   country, Trump said. I have a feeling that Steve has made a great sacrifice, but there could be some unity being brought to our great country.  Trump made his comments before signing an executive order to spark more skill training for jobs and apprenticeships in the economy. He also praised the two Capitol Police officers who returned fire and were wounded after the shooter began shooting. They ran right into the fire, he said. They ran right into those guns and the bullets, and they saved a lot of lives.  As the event concluded, Trump shared a spirit of unity with the media.

"Mr. President, Ending DACA Also Will Make Mexico Great Again - Breitbart",Breitbart,Dale Wilcox,6/15/2017,"President Donald Trump has an unprecedented opportunity to greatly improve the lives of the working people of Mexico and Latin America. How? By shutting down former President Obamas Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program on its fifth anniversary. [Why all the bother from Mexico when it comes to debate over our own national immigration policies? Because our porous borders with Mexico are a safety valve for Mexicos corrupt elite which reduces the public pressure for genuine domestic reforms. When the United States allows a Mexican to cross the border for   work, it also takes a potential protester or voter or activist off Mexicos streets.  For decades, Mexican political and business leaders have gone out of their way to attack the   legislation introduced by our elected officials, have filed legal briefs in our courts regarding important immigration cases, and theyve even published manuals to assist their citizens navigate their way illegally across our sovereign borders. According to   U. S. journalist Robert Joe Stout, an estimated 40 percent of the rural villages and towns in that country have suffered a population loss as high as 70 percent, largely because American governments have quietly allowed millions of Mexicans to cross our border. This exit, says Stout, has caused a dramatic increase in the number of   families, homeless, and runaway children, and of criminal gangs. This cycle of emigration and underdevelopment can end    and President Trump has the power to do it. No one would be better situated than your average   in Mexico to force the Mexican government to finally commit to actual reforms and respond to the needs of its people. Being relatively wealthy and educated and having seen what the rule of law really looks like, thousands of the   who return to Mexico would organize, agitate, and rally for domestic reforms. By ending further DACA renewals, and letting   gradually   President Trump could create the democratic pressure to solve to what has long been viewed as an impossible reform problem. However, if our President allows DACA to become permanent, the problem of illegal immigration will never end. A look at our long history of   amnesty is instructive. When a group of Salvadorian illegal aliens filed a lawsuit in 1983 demanding that they receive amnesty from the federal government,   of State George Schultz authored a letter to the Justice Department stating why such a move would be unjust. Among other things, Schultz stressed the prospect of inducing further immigration by Salvadorans and the already existing crisis from the floodtide of illegal immigrants into America. That amnesty induces further illegal immigration isnt speculative. Just six months after DACA was implemented, illegal entries from unaccompanied alien minors from Latin America doubled. And by the summer of 2014, it had doubled many times over. A special commission established by President Truman made the same conclusions. In 1950, the Commission on Migratory Labor was   to study the effects of illegal and legal immigration on American farmworker wages. One area of mention in the panels final report was numerous amnesties of illegal alien farmworkers pushed through by the federal government in response to pressure from Big Agribusiness in the 1940s. Immigration agents at the time testified that the amnesties had been a major pull force for further illegal entries. Further, mass legalizations at the behest of industrial farming interests, agents stated, prevented them from enforcing the law[1] and place[d] a premium upon violation of the immigration law. [2] Unfortunately, as we can see today, the agents testimony was ignored. Encouraging the DACA people to go home also would be good for the United States. Just take at look what happened in Arizona since it passed a series of   immigration measures a decade ago, all of which were challenged by Mexico. The states public school system immediately saw a $50 million surplus on the books. Wages in agricultural work and construction jumped, and rents fell as apartment buildings began reporting   moving out by the thousands. Writing a few years back in the Atlantic, former Mexican foreign affairs minister and frequent critic of President Trump and American immigration laws, Jorge Castaneda, said that curbing illegal immigration from Mexico would make social peace in the barrios and pueblos untenable.  Social peace may indeed be affected, but only for Mexicos elite."

Report: Netflix Now Has More Paid Subscribers than Cable TV,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/15/2017,"Online streaming service Netflix now counts more paid subscribers than the largest American cable television providers put together, a report has revealed. [According to the Daily Mail, a study conducted by the Leichtman Research Group has found that in the first quarter of 2017, Netflix had 50. 9 million paying subscribers, compared to 48. 6 million subscribers to Americas largest cable providers, which together comprise approximately 95 percent of the market.  Since 2012, subscriptions to cable television have reportedly fallen from 52. 6 million to 48. 6 million, while Netflix subscriptions have more than doubled in the same time period, from 23. 4 million to 50. 85 million. The   market lost about 410, 000 subscribers in the first quarter of 2017. This marked the first time that the industry has ever had net subscriber losses in the first quarter of a year, Bruce Leichtman, principal analyst at the Leichtman Research Group, told the Daily Mail. The shift toward streaming comes amidst rising prices for cable television, with some packages costing upwards of $200 per month. Meanwhile, Netflix has consolidated its customer base with the release of popular exclusive series such as Orange is the New Black, House of Cards and 13 Reasons Why. The streaming giant has also shelled out gigantic sums to acquire buzzy,   films, including the Brad   War Machine and the Will Smith   thriller Bright. Netflix reportedly spent $90 million to acquire the latter film, which is directed by End of Watch and Suicide Squad helmer David Ayer. Currently, 9 out of the 10 most   online television series are reportedly produced by Netflix, while one is produced by the streaming service Hulu. Earlier this week, The Hollywood Reporter reported that Facebook is considering entering the online streaming market, with plans to revive the series MTV Loosely Exactly Nicole, which was canceled after one season for low ratings.

King said, The other thing that was troubling though, that didnt get as much publicity, I asked him [Sessions] did you ever get a briefing on the     what the Russians did? Did you seek a briefing? Did you ask about it? And he said, no, I only know what I read in the papers.

All the jurys questions in the Cosby trial,CNN,Madison Park,6/15/2017,"Norristown, Pennsylvania (CNN) During more than 52 hours of deliberations, jurors in Bill Cosbys indecent assault trial asked a dozen questions. Three of them were requests to review what Cosby said, and another two were about the testimony of his accuser, Andrea Constand. The jurors also asked the court to define a phrase in one of the charges, to define reasonable doubt and to rehear a detectives testimony about Cosbys interview with police in 2005. Cosby, 79, was accused of drugging and assaulting Constand, who was the director of operations for Temple Universitys womens basketball team in January 2004, when she says the incident happened at Cosbys home near Philadelphia.  Judge Steven ONeill declared a mistrial Saturday after the jurors reported they were deadlocked. Cosby, who pleaded not guilty to three charges of aggravated indecent assault, faced up to 10 years in prison for each charge. Prosecutors immediately said they will retry the case.  The jury of seven men and five women was bused in from Allegheny County, near Pittsburgh, for the trial that started June 5. Jurors, who were sequestered in a hotel, began deliberating Monday evening. These are the questions the jury asked:  Question: Can we see in Mr. Cosbys testimony the part where he called the pills his friends? The jurors asked for a reading of part of Cosbys deposition from more than a decade ago in which he described giving pills to Constand on the night of the alleged sexual assault in 2004.  The drugs he gave Constand were    Benadryl, he had said. Cosby had called the pills friends. I have three friends for you to make you relax, Cosby said, recalling during the deposition what hed told Constand. Constand reported the incident to police in 2005, a year after the alleged incident. At the time, the district attorney declined to press charges, citing insufficient evidence. Constand sued in civil court, and Cosby provided a sworn deposition in which he said he had engaged in consensual sexual activity with Constand    and that he had obtained Quaaludes in order to give them to women with whom he wanted to have sex.  That civil suit was settled in 2006, and the Cosby deposition was sealed until 2015. The unsealed deposition was central to Cosbys ongoing criminal case.  Question: We would like to see evidence from      C43. Commonwealth exhibits 27 through 43 comprise a wider portion of Cosbys deposition from more than a decade ago.  Among the topics covered in these portions of the deposition:    How Cosby met Constand, and when he developed a romantic interest in her.    Cosbys description of what he says was a romantic encounter with Constand before the night of the alleged assault.    Cosbys description of what he says happened on the night of the alleged assault. That includes all the testimony covered in Question 1. Question: Will you please define what it means in count 3 without her knowledge? The jury asked the court to define the phrase without her knowledge in the third count of the aggravated indecent assault charge against Cosby. Judge Steven ONeill said the jury had the written charge in its possession and that he is not permitted to define the charges any further, saying it was up to the jury to determine what the phrase means. The third count accuses Cosby of impairing Constand by administering drugs, intoxicants or other means for the purpose of preventing resistance.  ONeill offered to read the written charge, but the jury didnt take him up on it. Question: Can we see the initial report to the Durham Police or what the court reporter recorded of that interview of Andrea Constand? Canadian detective Dave Mason of Durham Regional Police took down the report on Constands sexual offense claim in January 2005. She made the report in her home province of Ontario, Canada. Last week, Mason testified in court about his interview with Constand.  According to Mason, Constand said she had gone to Cosbys house after dinner in   2004.  When they were alone in the kitchen, he offered a few blue pills to help her with tension, Mason testified recalling his interview. Shortly afterward she began feeling dizzy and said her legs were like jelly, Mason said. She said after she started experiencing those effects, Cosby escorted her to a sitting room, he testified. Mason said Constand didnt recall much after that and said that Cosby lied next to her and assaulted her. Question: Can we   the testimony of Andrea Constand from the night of the incident? Constand had testified over two days last week for the prosecution and had spoken about the night of the alleged indecent assault by Cosby. The court reporter read back that part of her testimony. Constand alleged that Cosby gave her three blue pills that he said were herbal and would help her relax. Put them down, theyre your friends. Theyll take the edge off, Cosby told her, she testified. She became incapacitated and felt frozen and told him so, Constand testified. Cosby then placed her on the couch and sexually assaulted her without her consent, she had said.  Question: Can we hear the Richard Schaffer testimony about his talk with Mr. Cosby? Sgt. Richard Schaffer with Pennsylvanias Cheltenham Township police department testified last week about a January 2005 interview that Cosby gave to police about the alleged assault.  That interview occurred in the presence of Cosbys lawyers in New York City.  In court, Schaffer read aloud Cosbys statements from that interview.  During his interview with law enforcement, Cosby said that he gave Benadryl to Constand. In response to the jurys sixth question, Schaffers entire testimony had to be transcribed by the court reporter, which she read back to the jury. The reading took nearly an hour on Wednesday. Question: Can we hear Cosbys deposition about Quaaludes? Jurors on Friday morning asked the court to repeat Cosbys deposition in a civil lawsuit that was unsealed in 2015. Speaking under oath, Cosby said he acquired seven prescriptions for Quaaludes, the powerful sedative, in order to give them to women with whom he wanted to have sex. Cosby told a doctor that he had a bad back but did not intend to use them for himself, he said, because they made him sleepy. Quaaludes were the party drug of young people in those days, he said. He also said he did not have any in his possession as of November 2002. Prosecutors have argued that his acknowledged use of Quaaludes on women shows that his alleged drugging of Andrea Constand in 2004 was not a mistake. Question: What is reasonable doubt? In criminal trials, prosecutors must prove, beyond a reasonable doubt    the highest standard of proof in the legal system    that the defendant committed the crime. If members of the jury have a reasonable doubt as to the defendants guilt, they must declare him or her not guilty. In Cosbys trial, jurors said Thursday they are deadlocked and cannot come to a unanimous opinion on any of the three charges. Judge Steven ONeill asked them to continue deliberating, and they returned on Friday morning with the reasonable doubt question, suggesting that they remain deadlocked. Question: Can we hear Gianna Constands testimony on the first phone call with Bill Cosby? Gianna Constand, the accusers mother, testified about her   hour phone call with Cosby after learning about the alleged assault.  In that call, Cosby told the mother what he did sexually with Andrea Constand in graphic detail, trying to lead me to believe that it was consensual, she testified. He even said that he had given Andrea Constand an orgasm, the mother said. It sounds perverted. I sound like a perverted person, Cosby told her. He also admitted he was a sick man, she testified. Gianna Constand, who said she was aggressive and rude in the call, angrily demanded to know what pills Cosby gave her daughter that made her incapacitated. He told her that he could not read the label on the prescription bottle, and so he agreed to write down the medication on a piece of paper and mail it to her. She testified that she never received a note from Cosby. Question: Can we hear Andreas Constands testimony pertaining to D14 and D15? These two documents pertain to the phone records that show calls between Constand and Cosby after the alleged assault. A total of 72 phone calls were made in that time, and Constand called him on 53 of those. Defense attorneys, who tediously went through each of those calls, argue that they prove Constand was untruthful when she told investigators that she had little contact with Cosby after the alleged assault.  I was mistaken, she testified. It was a lot of confusion putting a lot of dates together. Cosbys defense has argued that the calls show Constand was not behaving like a victim of sexual assault. Constand, who was an employee at Temple University, said the majority of those calls to Cosby, a powerful Temple trustee, were made as part of her job responsibilities.  Question: Can we hear a section of Gianna Constands testimony? The judge denied the request, saying, This was just read to you. He instructed them to rely on their collective recollection. Question: Can we hear Stewart Parsons testimony?  Stewart Parsons, Andrea Constands    is a police officer in Toronto.  He testified that he learned about the incident in January 2005 from his wife, who had been told by her mother. He advised Andrea Constand to get an attorney and file a police report. He also told Constands mother to record any more conversations with Cosby."
How Russia Probe Exposes Loretta Lynch for Possible Wrongdoing in Clinton Email Case - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/15/2017,"NEW YORK, NY     In the course of the investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, serious questions have been raised about the possibility that former Attorney General Loretta Lynch may have engaged in wrongdoing with regard to the FBIs criminal investigation into Hillary Clintons emails. [There are three main issues surrounding Lynchs possible misdeeds in the Clinton email probe.  One is Lynchs infamous tarmac meeting last June at the Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport in which former President Bill Clinton, the husband of the FBIs main subject in a criminal probe     Hillarys email case     boarded the attorney generals plane and reportedly stayed there for about thirty minutes for a private chat. The second concern is Lynchs reported directive for   Director James Comey to publically refer to the FBIs criminal investigation into Clintons email as a matter instead of an investigation or a criminal probe. The language matched the specific rhetoric used at the time by Clintons 2016 presidential campaign, which referred to the criminal investigation as a matter.  The third issue relates to testimony and questions surrounding reports claiming that Comey was in possession of a document purportedly indicating that Lynch would ensure the Clinton email probe didnt go too far. Largely unreported by the news media, these questions surrounding Lynch are so serious that, in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee this month, Comey conceded that the appointment of a special counsel in the Clinton email case would have been appropriate due to his concerns about Lynch. Referring to Lynchs directive for Comey to call the criminal email probe a matter as well as her private tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn asked the   chief the following pointed question: And under Department of Justice and FBI norms, wouldnt it have been appropriate for the attorney general, or, if she had recused herself     which she did not do     for the deputy attorney general to appoint a special counsel? Thats essentially whats happened now with Director Mueller. Would that have been an appropriate step in the Clinton   investigation, in your opinion? Yes, certainly a possible step, replied Comey. Yes, sir.  And in testimony in May, Comey expressed his concern that the [Justice Department leadership could not credibly complete the investigation and declined prosecution without grievous damage to the American peoples confidence in the     in the justice system.  In a tweet on Thursday, President Trump brought up the issue of possible obstruction with Lynchs tarmac episode. Crooked H destroyed phones   hammer, bleached emails,  had husband meet   days before she was    they talk about obstruction?     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 15, 2017,  Tarmac Trouble  The tarmac meeting was first reported by a local ABC affiliate in Phoenix, which asked Lynch about the incident at a   news conference at the Phoenix Police Department. Lynch confirmed to ABC15 in Phoenix that she did see President Clinton at the Phoenix airport as he was leaving and spoke to myself and my husband on the plane.  The local station quoted sources saying the meeting lasted about thirty minutes. Lynch claimed there was no discussion of State Department emails or any other matter pending before the Justice Department. She maintained that the conversation was a great deal about grandchildren, it was primarily social about our travels and he mentioned golf he played in Phoenix.  The tarmac meeting was first revealed by ABC15s Christopher Sign, who said that he was tipped off about the event by a trusted source.  Sign described a scene in which the FBI reportedly asked people at the tarmac not to take photographs. The FBI there on the tarmac instructed everybody: no photos, no pictures, no cell phones, Sign stated. The Obama White House postured to explain the meeting. Following the disclosure of the tarmac episode, President Obamas press secretary, Josh Earnest, felt the need to iterate Obamas stated commitment to avoiding political interference in Justice Department investigations. Judicial Watch raised the possibility of ethical and legal problems for Lynch. Attorney General Lynchs meeting with President Clinton creates the appearance of a violation of law, ethical standards and good judgment, the conservative government watchdog group said in a statement: Attorney General Lynchs decision to breach the   ethical standards of the Department of Justice and the American legal profession is an outrageous abuse of the publics trust. Her conduct and statements undermine confidence in her ability to objectively investigate and prosecute possible violations of law associated with President Clinton and Secretary Clinton. The New York Times in April first reported that the tarmac incident solidified Comeys decision to go rogue, bypass the Justice Department and violate FBI tradition by holding a July 5, 2016, press conference to make conclusions on Clintons email case  At the gripping press event, which took place in the heat of the presidential campaign, Comey criticized Clintons private email server as extremely careless before finally stating that no charges are appropriate in this case.   Comey was widely criticized for going rogue instead of failing to seek Lynchs recusal on the Clinton case. His actions were cited in a letter from Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein recommending that Comey be fired. In his Senate testimony this month, Comey confirmed Lynchs tarmac meeting with Clinton capped his decision to make public the results of the FBI probe into Clintons emails. Referring to the tarmac meet, Comey stated, In an ultimately conclusive way, thats the thing that capped it for me that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation which meant both the FBI and the justice department.   The Matter The statement that the tarmac meeting served as a cap to Comeys decision to bypass Lynchs Justice Department in the email investigation indicates Comey had other concerns about Lynch. Indeed, in the same hearing, the next question posed to him by Republican Senator Richard Burr, chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, focused precisely on that. Were there other things that contributed to that that you can describe in an open session? asked Burr. Comey replied: There were other things that contributed to that. One significant item I cant. I know the committees been briefed on. Theres been public accounts of it which are nonsense. But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. The only other consideration I can talk about in an open session, she told me to call it matter, which confused me and concerned me. But that was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I have to step away from the department if were to close this case credibly. Comeys one significant item seems to be a clear reference to the issue of a reported document allegedly indicating Lynch would interfere in the email probe to ensure it didnt go too far. Meanwhile, Comeys admission that Lynch told me to call it matter     a directive that confused and concerned him     serves as a significant public accusation against Lynch, possibly highlighting her intentions in the email probe. It is instrumental to recall that at the time, Clintons 2016 presidential campaign not only referred to the criminal email probe as a matter, Clintons official campaign website claimed the investigation was not a criminal inquiry. Lynch allegedly issued the matter directive to Comey despite the Justice Department knowing the FBI probe was not only an official investigation but a criminal probe. In spite of Comeys stated concerns, he did call the investigation a matter in his public statements about the Clinton email case. The alleged Lynch directive was first revealed in the same extensive April 22 report in The New York Times.  The Times reported on a meeting between FBI and Justice officials at which, according to the newspapers characterization, Lynch told him (Comey) to be even more circumspect: Do not even call it an investigation, she said, according to three people who attended the meeting. Call it a matter.  The Times report continued: Ms. Lynch reasoned that the word investigation would raise other questions: What charges were being investigated? Who was the target? But most important, she believed that the department should stick by its policy of not confirming investigations. It was a    decision. But Mr. Comey and other F. B. I. officials regarded it as disingenuous in an investigation that was so widely known. And Mr. Comey was concerned that a Democratic attorney general was asking him to be misleading and line up his talking points with Mrs. Clintons campaign, according to people who spoke with him afterward. As the meeting broke up, George Z. Toscas, a national security prosecutor, ribbed Mr. Comey. I guess youre the Federal Bureau of Matters now, Mr. Toscas said, according to two people who were there. Even though Comey reportedly had concerns about Lynchs motivations, he went along and did not call it a criminal investigation. I am confident we have the resources and the personnel assigned to the matter, Comey stated mere days after the meeting with Lynch. Further raising questions about Lynch, in his Senate testimony this month, Comey lobbed a serious accusation about Lynchs intentions in the ordeal (emphasis added):  He stated:  And     and again, I dont know whether it was intentional or not, but it gave the impression that the attorney general was looking to align the way we talked about our work with the way a political campaign was describing the same activity, which was inaccurate. We had a criminal investigation open with     as I said before, the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We had an investigation open at the time, and so that gave me a queasy feeling. Sen. Diane Feinstein ( ) the top Democrat on the Senates Judiciary Committee, commented on the seriousness of the alleged Lynch matter directive, speaking this past Sunday on CNNs State of the Union. I would have a queasy feeling too, though, to be candid with you, she told CNN about the issue. I think we need to know more about that, and theres only one way to know about it, and thats to have the Judiciary Committee take a look at that.  On Wednesday, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley ( ) sent Feinstein a letter formally requesting that the committee probe any attempts to influence the FBIs investigations under the Trump and Obama administrations. It is not immediately clear whether the Judiciary Committee has taken any action on the matter.  At a Tuesday press conference, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ( ) stated that he wants to hear what Loretta Lynchs side of the story is before making any move regarding Lynch.  However, at a House Judiciary Committee hearing on Thursday, Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) grilled Acting Deputy Assistant Attorney General Richard Downing about Lynchs alleged matter directive. Mr. Comey testified that former AG Loretta Lynch told him to, when he discussed the Clinton investigation, to call it a matter not an investigation, Jordan explained. Do you agree with that decision that was made?  Downing replied, I dont have an opinion one way or another on that.  Do you think its wise for the Justice Department to mislead the American people? Jordan shot back. Of course, the Justice Department should do its best not to mislead anyone, Downing retorted. I think what the American people would appreciate is their highest officials at the DOJ should be straight with the American people, Jordan added during the course of the exchange. And that did not happen.  Alleged Lynch Document, The issue of a possible document implicating Lynch is shrouded in conflicting news media reports and testimony implying that the matter has been presented in closed session before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The alleged document was first reported by The New York Times in the same extensive April report on Comey. According to that report, the FBI possessed information that the alleged Lynch document had been hacked by Russian intelligence, leading Comey to fear that Moscow could leak the document to call into question the independence of the Clinton email probe. The newspaper described a document written by a Democratic operative that seemed     at least in the eyes of Mr. Comey and his aides     to raise questions about [Lynchs] independence.  The newspaper further described the reported document: During Russias hacking campaign against the United States, intelligence agencies could peer, at times, into Russian networks and see what had been taken. Early last year, F. B. I. agents received a batch of hacked documents, and one caught their attention. The document, which has been described as both a memo and an email, was written by a Democratic operative who expressed confidence that Ms. Lynch would keep the Clinton investigation from going too far, according to several former officials familiar with the document. Read one way, it was standard Washington political chatter. Read another way, it suggested that a political operative might have insight into Ms. Lynchs thinking. While he was still FBI director, Comey was asked at a Senate hearing on FBI oversight in May about the about the purported Lynch document, and he refused to publicly address the matter, explaining it was an issue for a classified setting and not a public hearing.   After the issue of the purported document was raised at that hearing, the Washington Post released a story with an entirely different narrative on the alleged document. According to the Post report, the document     reportedly central to Comeys actions on the Clinton email probe     was assessed by Comeys own FBI to be unreliable and possibly fake. Comey seems to have pushed back against the Post report when he stated in his testimony this month (also referred to earlier in this article):  One significant item I cant. I know the committees been briefed on. Theres been public accounts of it which are nonsense. But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts.  And Sen. Lindsay Graham, who would have been present for classified testimony on the Russia probe, has publically stated that he doubted the purported Lynch document was fake. Regarding the Posts story on the alleged document, Graham stated on Face the Nation: I saw the Washington Post story. I doubt if its fake. Maybe it is. But I dont want to be briefed by myself. I want Democrats and Republicans on the judiciary to be briefed together. Our committee has been together and were going to stay together.  Graham further discussed the alleged document:  And I want Comey to come to our committee, because I know on two separate occasions, he has told members of the House and the Senate that the main reason he jumped into the election last year and took over the job of attorney general is because he believed there were emails between the Democratic National Committee and the Department of Justice that compromised the Department of Justice, and he thought the Russians were going to release these emails. Thats why he jumped in and took over Loretta Lynchs job. I want to know, is that true? According to the Posts account, the document in question was not a note written by a Democratic operative about Lynchs alleged loyalties to Clinton, as The Times reported. Instead, the Post claimed the memo was a Russian intelligence document that itself quoted secondhand from a purported email describing how Lynch told someone within the Clinton campaign that she would help to ensure that the Clinton email probe did not go too far. The document, according to the Post, cited an email said to have been written by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( ) who at the time was chair of the Democratic National Committee. The alleged correspondence cited in the purported document was sent by Schultz to Leonard Benardo, who works at billionaire George Soross Open Society Foundations. The Post reported that the alleged Russian intelligence document merely cited some of the contents of the supposed Wasserman Schultz email to Benardo but did not actually contain a copy of the alleged message. According to the Posts characterization of the alleged document, Wasserman Schultz claimed Lynch had been in private communication with a senior Clinton campaign staffer named Amanda Renteria during the campaign. The document indicated Lynch had told Renteria that she would not let the FBI investigation into Clinton go too far, according to people familiar with it.  Contacted by the Post, Wasserman Schultz and Benardo both said they do not know each other and never communicated.  Wasserman Schultz, Benardo, and Renteria told the Post that they were never interviewed by the FBI on the matter. The Post claimed that the FBI provided Lynch with a defensive briefing on the alleged document in which she was reportedly cooperative, in contrast to a report from this week describing a very different kind of meeting with Lynch. The Post reported: About a month after Comeys announcement, FBI officials asked to meet privately with the attorney general. At the meeting, they told Lynch about a foreign source suggesting she had told Renteria that Clinton did not have to worry about the email probe, because she would keep the FBI in check, according to people familiar with the matter. Just so you know, I dont know this person and have never communicated with her, Lynch told the FBI officials, according to a person familiar with the discussion. The FBI officials assured her the conversation was not a formal interview and said the document didnt have investigative value, the person said. Nevertheless, the officials said, they wanted to give the attorney general what is sometimes referred to as a defensive briefing     advising someone of a potential intelligence issue that could come up at some future point. Adding further intrigue to the Lynch document issue, this week Circa cited sources who were directly briefed on the matter, revealing that Comey briefed Congress on a frosty exchange that he says he had with Lynch centering on the purported document. Circas John Solomon and Sara A. Carter reported:  During the conversation, Comey told lawmakers he confronted Lynch with a highly sensitive piece of evidence, a communication between two political figures that suggested Lynch had agreed to put the kibosh on any prosecution of Clinton. Comey said the attorney general looked at the document then looked up with a steely silence that lasted for some time, then asked him if he had any other business with her and if not that he should leave her office, said one source who was briefed.  Comey took that interaction and the fact she had met with Bill Clinton as enough reason to decide he would not allow the Justice Department to decide the fate of the case and instead would go public with his own assessment that the FBI could not prove Mrs. Clinton intended to violate the law when she transmitted classified information through her private email and therefore should not be criminally charged.

Uber Drivers Dismembered in Mexican Border State by Cartel,Breitbart,Cartel Chronicles,6/15/2017,"MONTERREY, Nuevo Leon     At least three Uber drivers were executed while others were targeted in a matter of months, indicating a new front in organized crime. [Like using taxi drivers as lookouts and street level dealers, now local cartels have turned their eyes toward Uber drivers.   The Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas were the first criminal groups that used regular taxicabs to sell drugs and infiltrate the streets of Nuevo Leon with moving lookouts. As Uber recently became popular in the city, authorities are seeing more cases of drivers with the ride sharing service taking part in organized crime.  The industrial state of Nuevo Leon has a small border with Texas and one international bridge.  In six months, Nuevo Leons Attorney Generals Officer recovered evidence of multiple cases where Uber drivers were tied to the transportation of drugs,   dealing, robberies, and other activities tied to organized crime. Authorities also caught three murders, a homicide attempt, and a disappearance all tied to the companys contractors.  The first murder case took place in December when the relatives of    Gustavo Saavedra Perez reported him missing after he disappeared for more than 72 hours. The victims body was found beheaded and dismembered in the trunk of a Chevrolet Aveo with Nuevo Leon license plates  .  A Nuevo Leon law enforcement official revealed to Breitbart Texas that the GPS system in the vehicle helped investigators find the evidence in the Jardines de Guadalupe neighborhood. The current probe points to the   distribution of drugs and the victims reported addiction to cocaine as a motive for the murder.  In March, Nuevo Leon authorities revealed that gunmen dismembered    Mauricio Huerta who was also identified as an Uber driver. The case was also linked to the sale of drugs. Huerta was beheaded and dismembered, placed inside black trash bags in the town of Santa Catarina, a dangerous industrial suburb of Monterrey. Next to the remains, cartel members placed a poster board message targeting Los Zetas faction, Cartel Del Noreste (CDN). The message was signed by Golden Group and Commander 25 of Los Zetas Vieja Escuela or Old School.  A month later, an Uber driver with a passenger was kidnapped and tortured by cartel gunmen trying to gather information tied to drug trafficking. The victims were dumped on the side of a highway that connects Monterrey with the suburb of Apodaca. The killers believed that    Ruben Beltran Sanchez, the passenger, was dead. The victim survived the ordeal and provide authorities with information about the attack.  In May, a taxi driver was shot by cartel gunmen as he pulled into his house in the suburb of Escobedo. Editors Note: Breitbart Texas traveled to the Mexican States of Tamaulipas, Coahuila, and Nuevo Len to recruit citizen journalists willing to risk their lives and expose the cartels silencing their communities.

International Criminal Court Demands Immediate Arrest of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/15/2017,"Moammar Qaddafis son Saif   recently released from half a decade of captivity by a Libyan militia group, has hit a major stumbling block in his bid to become a unifying figure for   Libya: the International Criminal Court wants him arrested and hauled before a war crimes trial in the Hague. [This is not an entirely surprising development because the ICC has made it clear all along that it considers Qaddafis case very much open. It was not clear until now just how aggressively the court would pursue him, but it was made very clear indeed in a statement on Wednesday from chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda.  Bensouda declared that the 2011 arrest warrant against Saif remains valid, and Libya is obliged to immediately arrest and surrender Mr. Qaddafi.  She called upon any other state that has an opportunity to arrest Qaddafi to do so if he leaves Libya.  Helping a fugitive to escape justice must not be tolerated, and Mr. Gaddafi must be surrendered to the custody of the Court, Bensouda declared. She added this directive supersedes any purported amnesty law in Libya.  One of Libyas several governments declared an amnesty throughout the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Another Libyan government sentenced Qaddafi to death in absentia in 2015 and has given no indication of rescinding its judgment. Human Rights Watch (HRW) applauded the ICCs demand to bring Saif   to justice, citing a U. N. Security Council resolution requiring Libyan authorities to cooperate with the ICC, while also accusing his former captors of   abuses for their treatment of him. The reported release of Gaddafi based on a flawed amnesty law does not change the fact that he is wanted by the ICC for crimes against humanity. The Zintan brigade, which alleges that it released him, should urgently disclose his current whereabouts, said HRW International Justice Director Richard Dicker. However, Human Rights Watch also noted that the Zintan brigade held Qaddafi incommunicado, subjected him to solitary confinement, denied him access to legal counsel, illegally interrogated him, and held him long after the Libyan government the brigade nominally answers to ordered his release.  Also, HRW noted that the Libyan court which sentenced Qaddafi to death did not meet international fair trial standards and cited the wording of the Libyan amnesty law to point out that it does not cover the   offenses Qaddafi stands accused of, concluding that only the International Criminal Court can handle the case. In fact, Human Rights Watch wants the ICC to take over more investigations and prosecutions of Libyans on all sides of its   conflict for human rights violations, including the abuse of migrants."
Redskins Quarterback Kirk Cousins Played Golf with President Trump Last Weekend,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/15/2017,"Members of the liberal sports media are aghast after reports that Washington Redskins quarterback Kirk Cousins recently played a round of golf with President Donald Trump. [NBCs ProFootballTalk, for instance, was quick to note that the Golden State Warriors are rumored to refuse an invitation to visit with Donald Trump, but Redskins thrower Kirk Cousins had no such qualms about being seen in public with the president.  The president and Cousins batted the ball around at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminister, New Jersey. The quarterback noted that he had Eric Shuster, the director of strategic partnerships at CSN Midatlantic, to thank for arranging the matchup. Cousins added that playing with the president was an opportunity he just couldnt pass up, the Washington Post reported. Great experience, Cousins told the media on Wednesday. I didnt ever think that would happen.  Cousins also pointed out that hed be happy to play golf with any other former president, too. Had a good enough time that if theres any former presidents in the D. C. area that want to give me a call, Id love to meet them at one of the courses around here, he added. I know lots of them are members at these courses and Im not, so Id love to get on and get to met them. Republican, Democrat, left, right, Id love an invite.  Another sports notable who recently hit the links with the president was Denver Broncos quarterback Peyton Manning.

National Geographic Film Crew Accused of Baiting Sharks in Southern California - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/15/2017,"Maritime authorities intervened to stop a National Geographic crew from baiting sharks off the coast of Long Beach in the midst of a local panic about great white sharks appearing near the shore, according to a local news report. [The Orange County Register reported Wednesday that officials suspect that some media outlets arent satisfied with footage of naturally occurring shark sightings.  It elaborated:  Long Beach lifeguard officials say they strongly suspect film crews are throwing fish or bait in the water near shore to attract sharks, also known as chumming.  Weve gotten some reports from citizens who have seen recreational boats out chumming, Gonzalo Medina, Marine Safety chief, said. Some fishing boats too. Theyre trying to get video footage of the sharks. Some film crews are reportedly chumming within 100 yards of the shore. One official told the Register that authorities had stopped a National Geographic film crew: We had a crew from National Geographic.        We talked with them, and they were very receptive. Ultimately, they used rubber fish attached to a line that they could pull back in.  The crew was not issued a citation, the Register reports. In late April, a woman was attacked and severely injured by a great white shark while swimming at San Onofre State Beach in Orange County. Since then, great white sharks have been spotted near the shore in Orange County and in Long Beach. Though it is not rare to see juvenile great whites in Southern California waters, it is unusual to see mature sharks, especially near the shore. The news reports have frightened many swimmers and surfers as the summer season begins. Now, it seems, media companies may be chumming the waters to create the very news they hope to report. Joel B.

Even Massive Influx in Immigrants Cant Offset Exodus from Blue Cities - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/15/2017,"Major   cities need to import yet more immigrant residents to replace the Americans fleeing from those cities crowded,   and expensive districts, according to a Bloomberg article. [The government imports 1 million new legal immigrants per year, even as 4 million young Americans turn 18, but according to Bloomberg:  Immigration to the U. S. has failed to make up for the number of residents leaving New York, Los Angeles and Chicago     the nations top three metropolitan areas. Chicago     beset by crime, economic and budgetary woes and high taxes     is the net exodus leader among 100 metro areas tracked by Bloomberg using Census Bureau data for the year through July 1, 2016. An average 245 local residents left the Windy City each day compared with the arrival of 71 foreigners. Census doesnt inquire about a persons citizenship status       For the nations third   metropolitan area, foreign immigration is the only offset weve got and it would be tragic to lose, said Diane Swonk, chief executive and founder of DS Economics in Chicago.  Rising government taxes, rental and housing prices in the   cities help push ambitious young Americans towards southern cities, such as Dallas, Austin, Tampa, Orlando, Atlanta, and Charlotte.  Some other coastal cities are also gaining population from arriving Americans, principally Seattle and Portland. But immigration is so high in Miami that it is pushing out Americans, just like in Los Angeles, New York and Chicago.  Young people are leaving the crowded cities, in part, because elite jobs and large immigrant populations combine to push up property prices and taxes, while also holding down the salaries and wages needed to start families. In the New York metropolitan area,   Manhattan prospers while old factory towns such as Paterson, New Jersey, and Waterbury, Connecticut, languish        While Los Angeles gained more than 54, 000 international migrants, it lost more than 87, 000 people due to domestic migration, said Bloomberg. That is bad news for conservatives in those states because GOP candidates tend to sweep districts with where   voters can afford to set up homes. Those trends were reflected in the 2016 election, where Trump won 26 of 27    states. As more Americans migrate southwards, they are likely to bring more   voters to their new districts, which help offset the huge immigrant inflow of   residents. Read the article here.

Grenfell fire: UK to carry out inspections on other towers,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/15/2017,"London (CNN) Britain will inspect tower blocks across the country after a deadly blaze at a London apartment building raised fears of similar catastrophes in other high rises. The inspections could involve hundreds of buildings, as London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced that checks would made be on tower blocks undergoing refurbishment. Residents and community representatives want to know how Wednesdays blaze was able to climb all the way up the   Grenfell Tower so rapidly, trapping residents inside.  At least 17 people have been confirmed dead and that number is likely to rise, officials say. Some bodies may never be identified, according the London Metropolitan police. Councilor Nicholas   told the BBC that sprinklers were not fitted inside the building during a   refurbishment because that would have delayed and made the refurbishment of the block more disruptive.  He added that the cladding fitted to the outside of the tower    and blamed by many residents for helping spread the fire    would not be used again.  According to the Times of London, the claddings manufacturer said its use is banned in the US on   buildings because of the fire and smoke spread.  Theresa Mays government criticized, As teams in London continue to carry out a recovery operation, British politicians have begun pointing the finger at their opponents.  One figure coming under scrutiny is Prime Minister Theresa Mays newly appointed chief of staff, Gavin Barwell, who served as housing minister until he lost his seat in last weeks snap general election. Barwell had told lawmakers that the government intended to review fire safety standards following a deadly blaze at the Lakanal House   building in south London in 2009, in which three women and three children died. In that case, exterior paneling helped the fire spread. Jim Fitzpatrick, an MP with the main opposition Labour Party, slammed the   government for shuffling its feet on the review, which has not yet been published. He said that he and a parliamentary group that he chairs have been pushing for better safety regulations since the 2009 fire.  This kind of event shouldnt be happening, but it takes money and it takes political will, Fitzpatrick, a former fire minister and firefighter, told CNN.  Engineering solutions of suppression systems like fire sprinklers could have prevented this fire from taking hold and would have prevented anyone from dying . .. Nobody dies in fires in sprinklered buildings. The Department of Communities and Local Government rejected Fitzpatricks comments that the Conservative government had sat on the review, saying it was simply not true and that the work was ongoing. Following the Lakanal House fire, the coroner recommended the guidance relating to fire safety within the building regulations (be) simplified, it said in a statement.  The coroner also asked (the) government to write to councils encouraging them to consider   sprinklers, which we did shortly after. Materials questioned, The countrys Policing and Fire Minister Nick Hurd said authorities were in the process of identifying towers that might be in a similar process of refurbishment.  They will run a system of checks and inspections so that we can as quickly as possible provide assurance to people, he said. Inspections will likely look at any cladding used. Documents show that aluminium composite material (ACM) was used in Grenfell Towers rainscreen cladding. ACM is essentially a sandwich of two aluminium sheets with materials for insulation inside. ACM panels often have a polyethylene core, which can be highly flammable. It is not yet clear whether this material was used in Grenfell Towers cladding.  Rydon, the company that carried out a recent refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, said the project met all required building regulations. Online records show that it had hired Harley Facades Limited to install the   with ACM cassette rainscreen. Ray Bailey    managing director at Harley Facades, a UK distributor which has since gone into administration    said the company was not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower."
Leonardo DiCaprio Surrenders Marlon Brandos Oscar to Justice Department,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/15/2017,"Leonardo DiCaprio has handed over to the federal government an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando that he was gifted by Red Granite Pictures for his work on The Wolf of Wall Street, as the Department of Justice closes in on the production companys alleged involvement in a massive Malaysian embezzlement scheme. [According to Deadline, the DOJ filed an asset seizure request Thursday in a California court against Red Granite, the film production company that has been accused of using millions of dollars stolen from a fund intended to benefit the people of Malaysia to pay for its productions.  In the filing, the government reportedly argued it should be entitled to seize the Red Granite films Dumb and Dumber To and Daddys Home as well as precious artwork purchased by the production company with what DOJ claims is stolen money. The filing reportedly includes a request to seize real estate, valuable artwork by Van Gogh and Picasso and an original poster for the 1927 Fritz Lang film Metropolis, said to be worth $1. 3 million, that reportedly hangs on the wall at Red Granites office. An August expos in the Hollywood Reporter detailed the link between DiCaprio, his eponymous environmental foundation and 1MDB, the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund at the center of the scandal. The DOJ alleges that Malaysian businessman and 1MDB advisor Jho Low funneled millions of dollars stolen from the fund into the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation, including for the purchase of artwork that was later auctioned off at the actors annual environmental charity gala in St. Tropez, France. The DOJ also alleges that hundreds of millions of dollars (of the more than $3 billion reported to have been misappropriated from the fund, in what could be the world   embezzlement scheme) went to Red Granite Pictures to fund its productions, including The Wolf of Wall Street, the 2013 financial crime dramedy for which DiCaprio won a Golden Globe in the starring role. Red Granite       by the prime minister of Malaysias   Riza Aziz, himself a central figure in the DOJ investigation     was reported to have given DiCaprio the Oscar won by Marlon Brando for his role in the 1954 classic On the Waterfront as a gift for his work on Wolf of Wall Street. In a statement to Deadline Thursday, representatives for DiCaprio     who finally won his own acting Oscar for The Revenant in 2015     said the actor reached out to the DOJ last summer to help cooperate with the investigation and to see if he needed to return any potentially   gifts or donations. The actor was reported to have earned around $25 million for his role as unscrupulous 90s Wall Street investor Jordan Belfort in the Martin   film. Prior to the governments filing of the civil pleading today, Mr. DiCaprio initiated return of these items, which were received and accepted by him for the purpose of being included in an annual charity auction to benefit his eponymous foundation, the actors reps said. He has also returned an Oscar originally won by Marlon Brando, which was given to Mr. DiCaprio as a set gift by Red Granite to thank him for his work on The Wolf Of Wall Street.  In keeping the   money, the Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation is acting in complete contradiction to its mission statement, which is to be dedicated to the   health and wellbeing of all Earths inhabitants       while restoring balance to threatened ecosystems and communities, Peter Kallang of the environmental group Save Rivers said in a statement in September. The money should thus be returned to the people of Malaysia to stop the massive destruction to the environment and ecosystem from land developments and pollution, he added. In October, rainforest preservation charity The Bruno Manser Funds called on the actor to resign his post as a U. N. Messenger of Peace for climate change as a result of the scandal.

Left Wing Extremist Offences Up 112 Per Cent in Austria,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/15/2017,"Left wing extremist offences have risen considerably in the last year according to Austrian officials who say that Islamic terror is still the most pressing danger. [The new report, presented by the Austrian Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Counterterrorism (BVT) shows that criminal offences involving left wing extremists rose 112 per cent in 2016.  A total of 383 offences were recorded by police compared to 186 in 2015 whilst there were 463 criminal reports opposed to 312 in 2015, Kronen Zeitung reports. The BVT say 46. 5 per cent of the cases involved left wing activists damaging campaign posters and other material of former   migration Freedom Party presidential candidate Norbert Hofer during last years election campaign. Other incidents have been much more violent such as the attack on the   migration Identitarian youth movement   Martin Sellner at a Vienna metro station by members of the     action group. Sellner was forced to use a pepper spray gun on his attackers who subsequently fled after punching and kicking him. Whilst the number of right wing offences, which included     and   incidents, numbered far greater at 1, 313, the increase was much smaller at only 13. 6 per cent. The increase in 2016 was lower than the increase in 2015, according to the report. BVT director Peter Gridling said Islamic extremism was still the biggest security threat to the country. As we have seen many times in Europe, religiously motivated Islamic extremism and terrorism is still the greatest threat to the security of democratic Western states, he said. At the end of 2016, 296 people were known to us who were travelling from Austria to the Syrian or Iraqi regions, but we were able to prevent 51 from leaving the country. Ninety returned to Austria and 45 persons were killed in the fighting area. The rest are still abroad, Gridling added. Left wing extremism has also been on the rise in Germany where in certain areas like Berlin, they frequently clash with police. A study showed that most of the extremists were young men who overwhelmingly still lived with their parents and most had no job and no girlfriends. Leipzig is another German city with a large left wing extremist scene. A report from   migration   organisation Einprozent claimed there had been 22 cases of left wing violence in the city in 2016. Several of the attacks were aimed at the   migration Alternative for Germany party which included the torching of several cars including   of the party Frauke Petry."
ICE Busts 39 MS-13 Members in New York Operation,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/15/2017,"Law enforcement immigration officers and agents joined forces to round up 39 members of the     criminal gang. Six other people were also arrested during the operation. [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) agents teamed up in Operation Matador to arrest a total of 45 criminal gang members. In addition to the 39   members, the operation led to the arrest of two Sureos, one member of the 18th Street Gang, one Latin King, one Los Nios Malos, and one with Patria, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from ICE officials. Operation Matador was conducted over a   period of time.  Transnational gangs like   bring nothing but violence and conflict to our communities and their presence will not be tolerated. Their vicious criminal activities present an ongoing challenge for law enforcement everywhere, Special Agent in Charge of HIS New York Angel M. Melendez said in a written statement. It is with the efforts of our federal partners under DHS and the incredible assistance provided by our local law enforcement partnerships with Suffolk County and Nassau County Police Departments that we will continue to dismantle these gangs piece by piece to enhance the safety and security of our communities.  Officials stated that 20 of the gang members had criminal histories. Some of those offenses include convictions for assault and weapons charges. One of the gang members reportedly has a conviction for larceny and a final order of removal from an immigration judge. Other significant gang members arrested include: These individuals are members of a violent street gang actively wreaking havoc in the community. This unified effort is about keeping New York citizens safe, New York ERO Field Office Director Thomas R. Decker said in the statement. ERO and HSI, along with our law enforcement partners, face no limitations in the apprehension and dismantling of transnational criminal organizations. We will not rest until our communities are safer and individuals like these are brought to justice.  More than 30 of the arrests came in Suffolk County, which routinely releases criminal aliens from its jail, even if ICE has placed an immigration hold on the suspect. In April, Breitbart News reported on the massacre of four Hispanic young men from Long Island, New York. The bodies of the men were so mutilated, they could only be identified by tattoos. Police eventually tied the murders to  . Breitbart Texas has been covering this violent transnational gang for several years. In July 2013, we reported on four   gang members that were convicted on counts of murder, armed robberies, and firearms offenses. That trial lasted for four weeks. At that time, FBI officials indicated members of the   gang were active in at least 42 states and had between 6, 000 and 10, 000 members. Those numbers have increased substantially with the massive influx of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) from Central American countries, particularly El Salvador. On June 10, Breitbart Texas reported the numbers of UACs, particularly from El Salvador, being apprehended at our southern border with Mexico is again on the rise following a   downtrend. Since October 1, 2916, 8005 UACs from El Salvador have been apprehended after crossing the border illegally     1, 493 in May alone. This is nearly a fifty percent increase from the previous month. Almost half of those apprehended this month had crossed in the Rio Grande Valley Sector in south Texas. ICE officials stated that of the 39   gang members arrested in Operation Matador, 12 had entered the U. S. as unaccompanied minors. Three other members entered the U. S. under Special Immigrant Juvenile Status. Some of those arrested had previously been deported and now face felony charges for illegal   after removal, officials stated. The rise of   violence has also dramatically impacted crime in the nations   city, Houston, where Governor Greg Abbott announced in April, the creation of a Texas   Task Force to target these criminal aliens. Breitbart Texas covered the press conference on April 11 of this year in Houston Gov. Abbott announced the expansion of the Texas   Task Force (TAG) and the creation of a technical operations center. Houston is one of the five cities that the FBI has identified to have a large   presence. ICE officials worked with state and county law enforcement officers in conducting the operation. Operation Matador was carried out under the auspices of the Department of Homeland Securitys Transnational Organized Crime Initiative.

Uber 2.0 doesnt need a Travis 2.0  even if he does change,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,6/15/2017,"Kalanick now needs to put his life ahead of his   work.   We shouldnt expect Travis 2. 0 to be that much   different from Travis 1. 0   The Uber crisis provides a moment to consider the moral   fiber of the    era.     Following the release of a withering report on Ubers workplace   culture by                           For Kalanick, Uber is a   game: I win, you lose, game   over. Actually, its harsher than that. In Kalanicks world, the   losers dont get to play the game anymore.     The result has been a near monopoly, but a costly one: Uber is   losing vast amounts of money to retain its position and the   dominant player in  . But Lyft, stubbornly, isnt   going away and cant seem to be spent out of existence.      Columbia Business School professor Evan Rawley  that this means the best Uber can hope for is   to become the leader of an oligopoly     a troubling proposition,   given Ubers lofty valuation, the need for investors to get a   payout at some point, and the ongoing cost of being the biggest.        Dealing with this challenge is going to require far more   technocratic leadership that what Kalanick can provide, and   thats why the Uber board has been looking for a Chief Operating   Officer to transition the company from being a scrappy street   fighter to a mature corporation whose practices wont freak out   conservative institutional investors.     As a practical matter, getting rid of Kalanick is difficult due   to Ubers compliant board and his equity power over the company       like most founders in Silicon Valley, hes rigged his shares so   that his vote counts for far more than everybody elses.      But Kalanick could, and I stress this, be a   person of more complicated character than Ubers early narrative   would indicate. Hes clearly smart, and hes clearly not devoid   of conscience, as his resignation from President Trumps advisory   council amid protests over the administrations failed travel ban   indicated. We shouldnt be so cynical to assume that a hard and   damaged man cant reinvent himself. There are second acts in   American life.     Which isnt to say that we should accept this whole Travis 2. 0   thing, oozing as it does with Silicon Valley privilege, at face   value. Travis 2. 0 could have a higher and better future, but   maybe it isnt with Uber 2. 0. The worst case scenario is   obviously that Travis 2. 0 returns to Uber with revenge on his   agenda.         Early on, I liked Uber and was an avid customer. But Kalanicks      approach to business always rankled me, and the   swiftness by which Uber became a favored verb, a signal of   ones hipness to the disruption, was disturbing. This was, after   all, a company that seemed to enjoy skirting laws and making   life hard for its drivers.     Living in the New York area, I went back to yellow cabs. Part of   this was practical     raising my hand to get a ride is easier than   fumbling with a phone. But part of it was also the result of how   Kalanickism had suffused Uber. I figured I had to take a stand,   and so I switched over to Lyft in case I needed a backup for     taxis.     None of this had anything to do with the evidently toxic   workplace culture that Uber engendered, but Im not surprised   that the companys crisis has revealed a morass of sexism, bad   behavior, and exploitative business practices in need   of immediate remedy. The bottom line is that I just had a   bad feeling about Uber than I couldnt shake.     What Kalanicks leave proves is that even with Silicon Valley   startups, theres a moral element to how we   interact with     and, as journalists, cover         enterprises. They dont get a pass because a large part of their   mandate is to obliterate and dynamically replace the old ways of   doing things. In fact, they need to rise to a higher level of   ethical scrutiny due to the heavy amount of destruction thats   baked into their DNA.     Its difficult to not be dazzled by the billions. But you still   have to look at yourself in the mirror every morning.  Kalanick now needs to put his life ahead of. .."

ICE Deporting 199 Iraqis after Trump Inks Repatriation Deal,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/15/2017,"Immigration officials are set to deport 199 Iraqi nationals after their home country agreed to accept deportees as part of President Donald Trumps negotiations regarding the travel ban executive order. Prior to order, Iraq refused repatriation. [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) Enforcement Removal Operations (ERO) officers carried out targeted arrest operations over the past few weeks leading to the arrest of 199 Iraqi criminal aliens. Most of the 199 Iraqis, 114, were arrested in the Detroit area, ICE officials stated. The arrested Iraqis have criminal records in the U. S. for homicide, rape, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, and a host of other crimes.  As part of the ongoing operations by ICE to deliver on President Trumps campaign promise to remove criminal aliens, ERO officers have been working diligently to increase their number of arrests. According to federal data, there are at least 2 million criminal aliens now inside the country,   candidate Trump said in an August speech in Phoenix. We will begin moving them out day one, in joint operations with local, state and federal law enforcement. Beyond the 2 million, there are a vast number of additional criminal illegal immigrants who have fled or evaded justice. But their days on the run will soon be over.  During the first 100 days of the Trump Administration, ICE arrests were up nearly 40 percent over the previous year, Breitbart Texas reported. The operation in this region was specifically conducted to address the very real public safety threat represented by the criminal aliens arrested, Detroit ERO Field Officer Director Rebecca Adducci said in a written statement. The vast majority of those arrested in the Detroit metropolitan area have very serious felony convictions, multiple felony convictions in many cases. I applaud the efforts of the law enforcement personnel who, day in and day out, put their lives on the line to protect this community.  ICE officials had previously been blocked from deporting Iraqi citizens because their home country refused to accept American deportees. However, during the negotiations to remove Iraq from President Trumps travel ban, the country conceded. (S) ince May 2017, the agency has arrested 199 Iraqi nationals nationwide, the overwhelming majority of whom had criminal convictions for crimes including homicide, rape, aggravated assault, kidnapping, burglary, drug trafficking, robbery, sex assault, weapons violations and other offenses, ICEs Michigan Information Officer Khaalid H. Walls wrote in a statement obtained by Breitbart Texas. Two individuals did not have criminal convictions but have pending criminal charges for drug trafficking, receiving stolen property and multiple arrests for domestic violence. One individual is a   with a final order of removal.  He directly attributed the arrests to the presidents negotiations with Iraq. As of   nearly 1, 500 Iraqi nationals have final orders of removal issued by an immigration judge that were previously unenforceable. Following the agreement, ERO officers began executing operations to reduce that number. Over the past several weeks, ICE officers arrested 85 Iraqi nationals in cities across the nation. Over this past weekend, ERO officers conducted targeted arrests in the Detroit area resulting in the 114 arrests. Since the March 12, 2017 agreement with the Government of Iraq regarding removals, eight Iraqi nationals have been removed to Iraq, Walls stated. Following the arrests of these violent criminal aliens, activists in the Detroit area are planning a lawsuit to block their deportations, Mlive reported. We are filing our class action immigrant rights lawsuit to halt the death deportations of over a dozen Chaldean, Muslim and other immigrants who were picked up during the ICE raids over the weekend, By Any Means Necessary (BAMN) national coordinator and lead attorney Shanta Driver said in a written statement. BAMN is a   militant group that played a leading role in the violent protests at U. C. Berkley earlier this year, Breitbart News wrote. Breitbart News also reported on the groups violent tendencies in February, stating: BAMN sees no distinction between admitted white supremecists and people who support President Trump, and considers both valid targets for attacks. Last summer, members of the   group the Traditionalist Workers Party on a permitted march were physically attacked by a group of about 400 protesters organized by BAMN.

Report: iPhone Assembler Foxconn in Talks to Bring Thousands of Jobs to Wisconsin - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,6/15/2017,"Foxconn, a Taiwanese corporation that assembles iPhones in East Asia, is considering building a plant in Wisconsin as part of a $7 billion investment that will create up to 50, 000 jobs, according to the Associated Press. [The investment would be a huge boost to Governor Scott Walker as he prepares to run for   in November next year. During a visit to Milwaukee on Tuesday, President Trump hinted at the negotiations, by saying that Walker might get a very happy surprise soon.   Foxconns main production lines are in China, where it employs around 1 million people assembling smartphones for companies such as Apple, Blackberry, Sony, and others. Founded in 1974, it had announced its potential   dollar investment in the United States back in January of this year. Foxconn CEO Terry Gou had said that any decision would be made based on whether   land or power could be provided by the state. At the time, Pennsylvania was the most probable candidate. Tom Still, president of the Wisconsin Technology Council, argued that the investment would make sense, as similar electronic manufacturers are already located in the state: It would be great for Wisconsin for a lot of reasons       I am assuming Foxconn was attracted by the fact theres already a skilled workforce here and theres a foundation to produce more such workers through the tech colleges and the other parts of the education system. Representative Joel Kleefisch, a Republican representative for the Wisconsin State Legislature, said that he would jump at the chance to work with the Walker administration to ensure that Foxconn did confirm the construction of the plant in their state, including passing any legislation for economic incentives to Foxconn. However, the state of Michigan is also apparently pursuing the plant. On the same weekend that Governor Walker made an unannounced trip to Japan to work on an undisclosed economic development opportunity, Governor Snyder of Michigan was also in the country. Snyder has recently been pushing for greater tax breaks for big corporations in his state Michigan State Senate Majority Leader Arlan Meekhof seemed to agree with the Governors desire, arguing that Michigan should put our best foot forward so that we dont lose all of [Foxconns investment] or part of it to a neighboring state.

Fox News Dropping Fair and Balanced Slogan - Breitbart,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/15/2017,"Fox News is no longer Fair and Balanced. [The cable news channel is reportedly set to drop its    marketing slogan in an effort to distance itself from its former chief Roger Ailes, who invented it when he launched the network in 1996, according to New York magazine.  Instead, staffers at Fox have reportedly been asked to use its other,    slogan: Most Watched. Most Trusted.  A source at the network reportedly told New York that the switch wont affect programming or editorial decisions.  The news comes as Fox News continues to move away from the Ailes era under the guidance of Rupert Murdoch and his sons James and Lachlan. Ailes, the principal architect of Fox who changed the cable news business forever,  resigned from the network last year under a cloud of sexual harassment allegations and died in May at age 77. The network has undergone significant changes in recent weeks following the departure of longtime star anchor Bill OReilly, whose OReilly Factor was the   cable news program for more than a decade. OReilly left the network this year after the New York Times reported that he had paid millions of dollars to settle multiple sexual harassment claims. In his place, Fox News brought on former Crossfire host Tucker Carlson to anchor the 8 p. m. hour and moved its panel show The Five into the 9 p. m. slot. Sean Hannity remained on at 10 p. m. The network remains the   on television, but has come under increasing pressure as MSNBC and its star anchor, Rachel Maddow, have benefitted from critical coverage of President Donald Trump. During one week in May, Fox News dropped to third place in the key demo in primetime behind MSNBC and CNN, the first time that had happened in 17 years.

Sarah Palin Considering Suing New York Times for Libel - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/15/2017,"Former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin is considering suing the New York Times for libel after the Times published a Wednesday editorial falsely accusing her of inciting Jared Lee Loughner to shoot Rep. Gabby Giffords in 2011 even though it has long been established that there has never been any evidence whatsoever linking Palin to the attempted assassination.  Palin tweeted that a journalist suggested to her on Thursday that the Times has fulfilled the two criteria for libeling a public figure   a reckless disregard for the truth and malice. She said she is talking to attorneys this AM and exploring options.  ( ) @nytopinion     commonsense suggestion by a journalist, am talking to attorneys this AM and exploring options. BTW, wonder.. pic. twitter.      Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) June 15, 2017,  ( )       WHY someone would no longer be in public eye? Think constant libel  slander have anything to do with it?      Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) June 15, 2017,  After James T. Hodgkinson, who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) and hated President Donald Trump and Republicans, shot House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) and targeted other Republicans as they were practicing for their Congressional baseball game, the Times decided to publish an editorial on Wednesday in which it falsely blamed Palin for the assassination attempt on Giffords: Was this attack evidence of how vicious American politics has become? Probably. In 2011, when Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in a supermarket parking lot, grievously wounding Representative Gabby Giffords and killing six people, including a    girl, the link to political incitement was clear. Before the shooting, Sarah Palins political action committee circulated a map of targeted electoral districts that put Ms. Giffords and 19 other Democrats under stylized cross hairs. In addition, despite plenty of evidence to the contrary (Hodgkinson asked at least two Representatives whether the players on the baseball diamond were Republicans or Democrats before he started shooting) the Times added that theres no sign of incitement as direct as in the Giffords attack As Breitbart    Joel Pollak pointed out, the Times false equivalence between the two shootings provides a sick excuse for what Hodgkinson did by making it appear to be partially Republicans fault. That is worse than fake news. It is an effort to exploit a horrific act of violence for the purpose of stoking political divisions, reinforcing the hysteria in which Hodgkinson was steeped.  Palin linked to Pollaks article in a Facebook post and slammed the Times sickening editorial that attempted to destroy innocent people with more lies and more fake news to advance the Times preferred narrative at all costs, facts be damned: With this sickening NYTs editorial, the media is doing exactly what I said yesterday should not be done. Despite commenting as graciously as I could on media coverage of yesterdays shooting, alas, today a perversely biased medias   blame game is attempting to destroy innocent people with lies and more fake news. As I said yesterday, Id hoped the media had collectively matured since the last attack on a Representative when media coverage spewed blatant lies about who was to blame. Theres been no improvement. The NYT has gotten worse.     SP, As Breitbart News has extensively reported, hours after Giffords was shot on January 8, 2011, outlets like CNN immediately tried to implicate Palin. It turned out that Loughner, the murderer who killed six people and shot 18, did not have any political leanings whatsoever. He actually spoke to Giffords at a town hall event years before and may have been upset that Giffords brushed off his question with a  . In any event, authorities definitively concluded that Loughner was in no way influenced by Tea Partiers, conservative media, or Palin.  After the Giffords shooting, Zach Osler, Loughners friend, told ABC that Loughner was apolitical and did not even watch television. He disliked the news. He didnt listen to political radio. He didnt take sides. He wasnt on the left. He wasnt on the right, Osler added. Another friend, Bryce Tierney, told   Mother Jones that Loughner was not political. As the   outlet noted: Tierney notes that Loughner did not display any specific political or ideological bent: It wasnt like he was in a certain party or went to rallies      Its not like hed go on political rants. The Times editorial was so outrageous and egregious that even mainstream media journalists, some of Palins most vicious haters on the right, and those on the left like Chris Hayes agreed that the Times had to issue a correction. Yep. If editorial board has any intellectual honesty theyll issue a correction for the    claim. https:  .      Jonathan Swan (@jonathanvswan) June 15, 2017,  On Thursday morning, the Times finally issued a correction that read: An earlier version of this editorial incorrectly stated that a link existed between political incitement and the 2011 shooting of Representative Gabby Giffords. In fact, no such link was established."
An ominous trend should caution the Fed against raising interest rates again anytime soon,Business Insider,Pedro Nicolaci da Costa,6/15/2017,"Federal Reserve officials have raised interest rates for the   second time this year and have indicated their intention to hike   borrowing costs at least once more before the end of the year.

Top Unis Islamic Society Gave out Leaflets Urging Terror Against West - Breitbart,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,6/15/2017,"Durham Universitys Islamic Society has been handing out booklets advocating terror, which were written by an Islamist preacher banned from the UK. [Zakir Naik, who is wanted by   authorities in India for having inspired terror attacks, was refused entry to the UK in 2010 by   Secretary Theresa May for making comments that were on their face supportive of Osama bin Laden,   and otherwise unacceptable.  The preachers booklet, which was distributed during Discover Islam Week in March, states that every Muslim should be a terrorist to   elements in society. Alcoholism has driven Western countries to high levels of rape, molestation, incest, and AIDS, according to Naik, who writes that a true Muslim ought to be a terrorist to such people. The booklet, entitled Answers to   Common Questions about Islam, also claims Western culture has turned women into concubines, mistresses, and social butterflies who are mere tools in the hands of pleasure seekers. It also states that women should wear hijabs to prevent them from being molested. A stall erected for Discover Islam Week displayed a sign inviting   students to try a hijab according to photographs published by the student online newspaper The Tab. Western womens dress is described in Naiks booklets, which were placed inches from the try a hijab signs, as an indirect invitation to the opposite sex for teasing and molestation. Recording the highest number of allegations of UK universities over the past two years, rape and sexual assault are high profile problems at Durham University. The Tab reported Martha Muir and Sabrina Steuer were handed the booklet during the weeklong event and complained to Durham University Islamic Society about its contents. They asked the society last month to withdraw Dr. Zakir Naiks material from any future DUISOC campaigns, and issue a statement clarifying your position regarding his views but got no response, according to The Tab. However, when contacted by the online student newspaper, president Mohammed Alatiyyah said the society is very sorry if anyone was upset or offended by the booklet, which he said doesnt represent the views of our society and was distributed by honest mistake. Naik has previously stated that Muslim men have the right to [have] sex with their female slaves. He also recommends the death penalty for homosexuals, who he believes are patients suffering from sinful mental problems. The Indian preacher is famed for having declared: If he [Osama Bin Laden] is terrorising the terrorists, if he is terrorising America     the biggest terrorists     then I am with him. Every Muslim should be a terrorist.  Breitbart London reported last year on how the Salafist preachers radical Islamic television channel was partially funded by tax breaks from the UK Treasury due to the charitable status of its   funder, the Islamic Research Foundation International (IRFI). Run by Naik, Peace TV has been slammed by British broadcasting regulator Ofcom for airing   content and a series of lectures it branded hate speech."

Cuban Dissidents on Trump Policy: Without a Doubt a Positive Step for Us - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/15/2017,"Cuban dissident leaders who protested President Barack Obamas normalization concessions to the Castro regime are eagerly awaiting President Donald Trumps anticipated rollback of these reforms, expecting Trump to be fair to dissidents and the exile community. [Trump will arrive in Miami, the capital of Americas Cuban exile community, on Friday to issue an address on Americas diplomatic stance with Cuba. Reports suggest Trump will limit U. S. travel to the country and restrict the ability of    business interests to exploit the Cuban people in negotiations with the Castro regime.  Speaking to the Spanish newswire service EFE, Antonio Rodiles, the leader of the dissident group Estado de SATS, said he expected the Trump Cuba policy to point in a different direction than what has happened, which has been concessions, concessions with nothing in return, and the result has been more repression and more control on behalf of the regime in Havana.  Rodiles called Trumps announcement, without a doubt a positive step for us, expressing confidence that Trump would make the respect for human rights on the island a key provision of any deal with dictator Ral Castro. He particularly lauded reports that the Trump administration would make it more difficult for the Castro regime to benefit from American businesses. It is tremendously contradictory that the armed forces are to receive most of the benefit of the new relationship with the United States, and at the same time are tasked with repressing those of us who defend human rights and liberties in the country, he argued. Rodiles had called President Obamas visit to the island in 2016 a pat on the back to the Castro regime and firmly opposed normalization.  Rodiles is not alone in his anticipation of the positive results of a Trump era policy that would undo the damage Obamas normalization has caused. The head of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) dissident group, Jos Daniel Ferrer, wrote an open letter to President Trump this week urging an aggressive rejection of Obamas policies. It is the moment to revert as much as possible these policies that only benefit the Castro regime and do not [benefit] the oppressed people at all or very little, he wrote. It is time to impose strong sanctions on Ral Castros regime, and on Nicols Maduros, he added, noting that the Cuban regime controls the highest levels of the socialist dictatorship in Venezuela and the freedom of one country is directly linked to the freedom of the other. Due to its outstanding position in the free world, the United States should not remain indifferent before the crimes that both regimes commit against their people, the letter continued. While noting that UNPACU initially supported the Obama normalization process, the letter concluded that the   implications of the policy, particularly the increase in human rights violations against dissidents, has forced them to rescind their support. Among the specific instances of this mentioned in the letter are the tripling of the number of political prisoners on the island, the beatings dissidents regularly receive from government agents, and robberies of dissident homes. A third prominent dissident, Agustn Lpez Canino, told EFE, according to the U. S.  Mart news network, that he expects Trump to be fair to dissidents and the exile community and condition the situation on human rights in Cuba, that facilitate a true presence of civil society in the government. Lpez Canino decried   Cuba as suffering under ferocious capitalism, where   corporations are getting rich without the existence of a truly free market. The Ladies in White     a Cuban dissident group consisting of wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of political prisoners     have not explicitly weighed in on the new Trump policy. This week, however, they sent a letter to the European Union, signed by their leader Berta Soler, calling for Europe to cut the Cuban regime off economically. Soler writes that, in response to the EU seeking a bilateral economic agreement with the Castro regime, far from changing its attitude and understanding these negotiations as the beginning of an agreement that would pull it towards becoming a part of the international democratic community, has taken it as a legitimization of its power and since then has acted with total impunity.  The letter requests an EU resolution condemning the Castro regime and a firm stance in favor of respecting human rights on the island. The Ladies in White have received the EUs Sakharov Prize for Human Rights Advocacy. Few details are currently public about the Trump Cuba policy scheduled for reveal Friday. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U. S. Senate that the policy would undo concerning moves by the Obama administration that had provided financial aid to the Castro regime. We believe that we have achieved very little when it comes to changing the behavior of the regime and its treatment of the people, they have little incentive to change, he said.

Mark Levin: Left Has Turned Violence Mainstream - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/15/2017,"CRTV and radio host Mark Levin said Wednesday that when those on the left dumb down or mainstream violence, some who are on the edge      become violent and they act out.   NOT FUNNY:  Kathy Griffin Beheads Trump       https:  .

Now, of course, the point is that you have kooks out there. You have people who are on the edge. When you dumb down or mainstream violence, these people become violent and they act out. Breitbart News compiled a list of 15 episodes of leftwing celebrities envisioning violence against President Donald Trump, including comedian Kathy Griffins shock beheading photo of the president, Madonnas statement that she has thought a lot about blowing up the White House, Joss Whedons tweet that he wants a Rhino to F*ck Paul Ryan to Death, and Shakespeare in the Parks stabbing Trump to death during a performance of Julius Caesar. Violence solves nothing.

The host showed video of violent leftwing protests, including one in November in which Los Angeles protesters burned Trump in effigy as they shouted, Not my president.  I dont remember any of that happening with Obama, or Bill Clinton, he added, asserting the lefts use of violent rhetoric and its insinuations and threats of violence are beyond the pale.  Levin likened the kind of violence coming from the left now to that during the 1960s, and referred to it as  .

Inside Picassos favorite watering hole,CNN,Thomas Page,6/15/2017,"Cannes, France (CNN) Walking around La Colombe dOr, a casual eye places it among the many inns dotting the French Riviera. This Provencal auberge wears its rustic charm like a badge of honor, or perhaps armor, warding off the dull trappings of the 21st century. Whitewashed plasterwork, scratched and scuffed, evokes simpler times. The inns many nooks and crannies speak of a building that has lived, breathed and grown over the years, before settling into reassuring, unrefined normality. Except theres nothing normal about La Colombe dOr. Look closer and artworks start to emerge: a Picasso nestled in one corner, a Matisse in another. In the courtyard outside, an Alexander Calder mobile rotates in the breeze while a Fernand Lger mosaic remains unmoved.  Some of the greatest names in modern art, nonchalantly arranged to look not only as if they belong, but as if they were created here. The thing is, some of them were. [The artworks are] completely part of the house, so we dont think of it anymore, says the inns   owner Daniele Roux. But you cant touch them, because the alarm system is so strong. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she wont be drawn on La Colombe dOrs insurance value. Tea with Matisse, The story of La Colombe dOr (which translates as The Golden Dove) is of a family that played the long game. In 1931, farmers son Paul Roux and his wife Baptistine opened their restaurant in a secluded corner of     a medieval hilltop village west of Nice.  Its raison detre was bon vivance good food and good times, a place to while away lazy summer days, eat heartily and drink well. With a handful of rooms above a bustling eatery, there was nothing remarkable about the inns setup. What no one could have anticipated was the clientele drawn to this crumbling bolthole and its unlikely role as a meeting place for the creative elite of the 20th century. World War I drove many French artists south, where they took up residence along the Cote dAzur. When peacetime came, some stayed. Among them were Fernand Lger and Georges Braque, who Paul    a versed, if not schooled art admirer    befriended. Alongside them, an aging Henri Matisse. He didnt really come in because at the time he had problems with his legs, says Pauls    Daniele. Paul Roux would spend time with him in [Matisses] limousine, on occasion taking tea. The artist became a regular at La Colombe dOr, and others soon followed, either as diners or lodgers. Paul Roux was the fulcrum around which these artistic figures pivoted, an autodidact and a man of lovely enthusiasm who, having begun to buy paintings, did not hesitate to provide accommodation for certain painters in exchange for their work, writes Martine Assouline (nee Buchet) in the 1995 book La Colombe dOr. Paul Roux was admired and respected    a working class Peggy Guggenheim, thoroughly ingratiated with a community of modern artists without being a creative name in his own right. (Under the advice of Matisse, Roux did pick up a paintbrush in later life. His artworks now hang alongside those of his famous friends    one is to the left of the Miro in the main dining room.) The guests wildly different styles, modes and philosophies all found a home under Rouxs roof. Within La Colombe there was commonality and community. Indeed, a sign hung above the inns entrance read Ici on lodge a cheval, a pied ou en peinture    Lodgings for man, horse and painters. The friendship of Picasso, With the arrival of World War II, life in La Colombe dOr held a reassuringly even keel, even as both German and American officers both found their way into its guest book. In the   years its reputation was further enhanced. Joan Miro, Marc Chagall and Cesar Baldaccini all added to the inns growing art collection.  Pablo Picasso was a regular visitor and became firm friends with Paul. But the Spanish master left no impression on La Colombes walls until shortly before Pauls death in 1953. Paul was not well physically, and Tichin [his wifes nickname] was a strong woman, recalls Daniele. She went round to see Picasso and said: You promised you would give him a painting one day.  He offered three paintings and Paul chose one. Flower Vase still has pride of place. On the day of Pauls funeral, Picasso was the first to pay his respects.   Pauls son Francis took the reigns, but one night in 1959    disaster. All the paintings were stolen all except one, a Chagall. The artist came down the next day, most irked, Daniele says. Clearly the thieves had poor taste. (Word spread of the theft and all the paintings were soon returned.) By the 60s a new set was frequenting the inn. Intellectuals   Satre and Simone de Beauvoir would stay, while James Baldwins fiery rhetoric could often be heard at the dining table. The American iconoclast even relocated to the region after staying at La Colombe in 1970, remaining in the area until his death in 1987. As with so many things on the Cote dAzur, the inn was not untouched by the Cannes Film Festival. Stars of the Nouvelle Vague Brigitte Bardot and director Francois Truffaut, spent days in the dappled shade of La Colombes courtyard, along with Orson Welles, Charlie Chaplin and David Niven, while Roger Moore owned a house nearby. Its glamorous credentials were never in doubt    the kings of Sweden and Belgium, and Edward VIII (then Prince of Wales) all visited in the 1950s. Successive generations continue to pay pilgrimage.  French literary titan   Levy has written several of his books at La Colombe. Prosper and Martine Assouline, founders of their eponymous publishing company, based their first title on the inn, such was their adoration. Artworks continue to be added, most recently a giant ceramic apple by Irishman Sean Scully in 2007. New young names are scouted out by Daniele and Francois, though most works lie in storage. By and large, the painters have gone, and the region that inspired them has become a playground for people who buy masterpieces rather than those who paint them. But three generations in, theres little sign this Provencal institution will cash out. A precedent was set by Paul Roux many years ago when a wealthy American tried to buy the business. He sent back a bouquet and a note: These flowers are for you, La Colombe is for my son. Daniele laughs at the mention of a fourth generation, batting away the question. We have a son, we have a daughter, but were still here and were going to see what happens, she says. Theres no pressure on them, she insists. If they one day accept the role, their charge will be to uphold an idiosyncratic space of art and life well lived    to find room, amid the modernist bricolage, for the next chapter of its story."
Patti LuPone Refuses to Perform for Trump: I Hate the Motherf***er,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/15/2017,"Broadway legend Patti LuPone says if President Donald Trump came to see her new musical, War Paint, she wouldnt perform for the motherf***er.

The New York Times, which published the lies that made it possible for Fidel Castro to become the islands dictator, laments that the United States Congress, businesses and other interested groups, including the Cuban government, may not be pleased by the changes (this is, the Times posits, a bad thing).  The foreboding tone of American liberal media coverage surrounding the potential repeal of Obamas 2014 normalization effort demands selective memory of the Obama eras effect on the Cuban people to take seriously. His policies may have prompted optimism among the CEOs of companies like AirBNB and Carnival Cruises. But Cuban dissidents report skyrocketing rates of arbitrary arrests and an   disregard for human rights in a country that already held one of the worlds worst records on the matter before 2014. Below, eleven images that capture the suffering of the Cuban people following President Obamas call for bilateral ties with the Castro regime, and the callous disregard the White House showed towards these consequences as they became impossible to ignore. February 2015: President Obama announced he would   friendly ties with the Castro regime in December 2014. Two months later, the regime challenged the call for treating dissidents with respect by not only beating and arresting members of the Ladies in White     a dissident group whose sole act of protest is silently attending Catholic Mass on Sundays dressed in white and holding the photos of political prisoners     but tarring one of their members, Digna Rodrguez Ibaez. Photo via Twitter.  September 2015: In a move meant to signal to the international community that they could ease the pressure on the Castro regime, Cuba invited Pope Francis to tour the city of Havana and the eastern regional capital of Santiago de Cuba. The government did not use the occasion of the pontiffs presence on the island to cease repressing dissidents, however. Zaqueo Bez, a member of the Patriotic Union of Cuba (UNPACU) approached the papal convoy in Havana and shouted freedom! within earshot of the Pope. He was beaten in front of the pope and whisked away into a police vehicle. Pope Francis later denied knowledge of the incident, though video proved he was feet away as Bez was beaten. The photo below shows Bez being taken away from Pope Francis. AP   Espinosa,  December 2015:      Francisco Morales had traveled to his home country every Christmas for the past decade to set up a Christmas display for the children of his Havana neighborhood without incident. After President Obama announced his normalization measures, however, Morales was arrested for setting up animated characters like Santa Claus and Mickey Mouse on the roof of his family home. Cuba is an atheist state that has persecuted and tortured Christians since the 1960s and only allowed leftist Liberation Theologists and Jesuit Catholics to operate unperturbed on the island in recent years. Evangelical Christians, Jehovahs Witnesses, and   Adventists are especially subject to arrest and other state abuse.  @CubanetNoticias,  January 2016: Cuban dissidents from a number of prominent groups on the island regularly suffer actos de repudio, acts of rejection, in which the government sends angry mobs to their homes to intimidate and insult them. In a particularly brazen rejection of international human rights norms, one acto de repudio featured a bonfire made up of copies of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Marti Noticias. March 2016: President Obamas trip to Cuba triggered some of the Cuban governments most aggressive abuses against dissidents. Below, the mass arrests of dozens of Ladies in White, grabbed by the clothes and hair and beaten into submission, shortly before the presidents arrival. Adalberto    Images,  March 2016: The oppression was not limited to Ladies in White. One Cuban dissident succeeded in using the occasion of President Obamas visit to protest live on American television. Yasser Rivero Bon, the son of a Lady in White who has lost most of his vision following beatings by Castro police, ran onto the set of ESPN and interrupted Bob Leys live broadcast to call for freedom on the island. Within seconds, a sqaud of   Cuban police apprehended and whisked him away.  .  March 2016: President Obama was not the only   visitor to the island this month. The Rolling Stones, a British band that Fidel Castro had banned from the island for their imperialist music, played a historic concert for those in the governments good graces that month. Naturally, this irked Cubas punk rock community, and in particular the band Porno para Ricardo, who writes punk music against the regime. In protest, they played a concert titled Public Scandal, in which they stood in silence, holding their instruments, for the duration of a concert. Porno Para Ricardo social media,  March 2016: President Obama completed his itinerary in Cuba, delivering a speech in which he quoted poet Jos Mart, stopping for   under the image of Castro butcher Ernesto Che Guevara at the Plaza of the Revolution, and attending a baseball game with Ral Castro.

Judge Orders Drunk Drivers to Install Uber and Lyft While on Probation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/15/2017,"An Ohio judge is ordering drunk drivers to install   apps such as Uber and Lyft while on probation. [Its not one of those unusual sentences. Theres nothing crazy about it, said Judge Michael. A. Cicconetti, who has made the requirement a condition of bail, according to Consumerist. Its just common sense. Now that we have the technology and most people have the ability to do that, why not make it part of their sentence?  It doesnt cost anybody anything to install it and activate it, and its far cheaper than paying the thousands of dollars youd have to pay for another OVI, he continued. Judge Cicconetti reportedly got the idea after he realized he couldnt get one man to stop drinking, but he could get him in the habit of using   apps. There was a fellow in here that I knew from Fairport. I see him at the clubs and organizations I belong to, Cicconetti explained. Youre not going to stop this person from drinking. Years ago I came to the realization that some people     it just doesnt make sense to send them to these alcohol programs because theyre not going to stop drinking, period. What you want to do is stop them from drinking and driving.  This guy was drinking at the Hungarian Culture Club. I said, Steve, for Gods sake, you only live a few blocks down, why didnt you just call Uber or Lyft and get a ride? It cant cost you more than three dollars! He said, I dont know how to do it. I said, I tell you how youre gonna do it. Youre gonna go back to probation here today and theyre gonna show you how to do it. And I want you to install that, he recalled. It was his fourth OVI overall. I told him, Dont be stupid. Then I got to thinking about it. And I said, Why not do that for everybody? So then the following week, I decided to just make it part of the sentence as a condition of probation.  I think judges nationwide should order it. Im not promoting Uber or Lyft. I have no monetary interest in Uber or Lyft, concluded the judge, before joking, In the next 20 years, theyll have   cars anyway so we wont have to worry about it.

Sweden: Migrant Cries Racism When Woman in Hijab Asked to Show Train Ticket Attacks Passengers with Knife,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,6/15/2017,"An Iraqi man travelling from Stockholm to Hallsberg by train launched a brutal attack on passengers after a Muslim woman was asked to show her ticket, accusing them all of racism. [Karim Alaa Hussain, 25, became infuriated when the unnamed woman, who was wearing a veil, was asked to show her rail ticket by a female conductor.  The Muslim woman complained she had already been asked to show her ticket once before, although eyewitnesses say the conductor was polite and correct. Hussain took a different view, according to a report by Fria Tider, corroborated by court documents seen by Breitbart London. Hussain sprang to his feet and demanded to know why the conductor had asked to see the womans ticket, refusing to accept her explanation that she was only doing her job and he became extremely intimidating. Other passengers intervened to try and calm him down, but this only increased his anger. He accused them of racism, threatening one of the men in particular and striking him in the face. Alarmed, Hussains victim wrestled him to the floor     but the Iraqi managed to break free and produced a long kitchen knife, stabbing the man four times in the side and back and inflicting critical internal wounds. Witnesses describe how Hussain then strode around the train cabin as if he had won the national championship brandishing his bloody knife at the terrified passengers and demanding a father and his daughter tell him if they were also racists. Hussain then began lecturing his captive audience on equality, instructing them that everyone was of equal value and demanding they show respect while his victim lay bleeding. When the train stopped Hussain fled and hid in a nearby garden, but was apprehended by the police. He told officers he had acted in   and was proud of what he had done, but the judge did not accept this, handing him a nominal      sentence. Hussain has an extremely long criminal record, and should have been serving a      sentence for a variety of offences at the time of his attack     but was released early. He will not be deported from Sweden after his current sentence is completed, having been awarded EU citizenship in 2008 despite having already wracked up several convictions."

A top Apple executive is denying an unflattering story from an upcoming book,Business Insider,Kif Leswing,6/15/2017,"A top Apple executive said on Tuesday that parts of a recent story in The Verge about the invention of the iPhone were not true.  On Tuesday,  published an excerpt  a book about the invention of the iPhone over a decade ago and the devices worldwide impact.  Parts of the excerpt painted Phil Schiller, Apples top marketer and one of the most important executives at Apple, in an unflattering light.  The excerpt says that Schiller fought for a   physical keyboard on the first iPhone until late Apple CEO Steve Jobs had to tell him to get with the program or get the    out.  Whats notable about the anecdotes about Schiller were that they stemmed from    quotes from top former Apple employees,  who was in charge of the iPod division.  :  It continues:  The passage culminates in Schiller shouting were making the wrong decision and being removed from a meeting and reprimanded by late CEO Steve Jobs, according to Fadells recollection in the excerpt. Schiller denied the physical keyboard anecdote in a tweet:   tttNot true. Dont believe everything you read. ..tt Fadell said hes asked Merchant to correct the record:   tttI respect  as a colleague & friend. The story about him is not true. Have asked writer to correct the record.   Fadells tweet makes it unclear whether he actually said the quotes attributed to him or whether he was misquoted. Fadells objection comes from the fact that he had quote approval, and he never approved the quotes about Schiller, a person close to Fadell told Business Insider. In an interview with Business Insider, Merchant said he stands by the story and said that his conversation with Fadell was recorded.   Its not an attack on Phil Schiller, Im just reporting on what people have said, he said.  Apple declined to comment.  One former Apple employee who reported to Schiller criticized the excerpt. I can tell you theres stuff thats just not true, Michael Gartenberg  on Tuesday. Gartenberg used to .  Anyone who says Phil isnt technologically sophisticated is an idiot, he told Business Insider on Twitter. Former employees always have selective memories. Myself included.  Apple blogger and podcaster John Gruber, who  in San Jose earlier this month and who is widely read by Apple employees, has     questioning the book.  The quick reaction from Apple defenders to Merchants unauthorized Apple history is reminiscent of what happened to other recent books in which the subject is Apple.   was criticized by executives including CEO Tim Cook and head of design Jony Ive.  in Yukari Iwatani Kanes book Haunted Empire, with Cook calling the entire work .   comes out next Tuesday.

Mexican Brewery Portrays Trump as Gun-slinging Nazi Mariachi,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/15/2017,"A new Mexican beer has a label depicting a   gloomy, mariachi President Donald Trump with a swastika belt buckle. [The Amigous Cerveza beer  has the word amigo misspelled to allegedly make fun of a mispronunciation of the word by Americans, reported Reuters.  The back label of the brew says the Republican president should be in a mad house, not the White House.  The chief executive of brewery, Casa Cervecera Cru Cru, Luis Enrique de la Reguera, was reported to be surprised with the success of the product. The original production was gone within a week. We knew that a Trump label was going to be controversial, but its been selling extremely fast, he said. Cru Cru designed the beer: similar to a New England pale ale with a hint of mango. The idea came to Cru Cru and his partner in Mexico, Error de Diciembre and Epic Brewing, before the presidential election. The Cru Cru team took to Instagram to wish President Trump a happy birthday. Best birthday ever        HBP! A post shared by ima_lore (@ima_lore) on May 25, 2017 at 8:42am PDT,  The Republican angered some when during his speech announcing his run for the presidency in June 2015 he said: When do we beat Mexico at the border? Theyre laughing at us, at our stupidity. And now they are beating us economically. They are not our friend, believe me. But theyre killing us economically. The U. S. has become a dumping ground for everybody elses problems. Thank you. Its true, and these are the best and the finest. When Mexico sends its people, theyre not sending their best. Theyre not sending you. Theyre not sending you. Theyre sending people that have lots of problems, and theyre bringing those problems with us. Theyre bringing drugs. Theyre bringing crime. Theyre rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. But I speak to border guards and they tell us what were getting. And it only makes common sense. It only makes common sense. Theyre sending us not the right people. Its coming from more than Mexico. Its coming from all over South and Latin America, and its coming probably    probably    from the Middle East. But we dont know. Because we have no protection and we have no competence, we dont know whats happening. And its got to stop and its got to stop fast. Virginia Senator Tim Kaine later claimed, As a candidate, [Donald Trump] started his campaign where he called Mexicans rapists and criminals.  As reported by Breitbart: Trump was referring to illegal aliens coming over the U. S.  border who commit additional crimes, such as rape. As Breitbart Texas has extensively documented, its common for human traffickers to to sexually assault or rape the females en route to the U. S. and the smugglers usually remove an article of clothing from the female they rape and they tie it tightly to a tree   a rape tree.  Furthermore, it is true that as the U. S. suffers from a massive heroin epidemic that killed over 47, 000 people in 2014 alone, nearly all of the heroin consumed in the U. S. is smuggled in by Mexican traffickers, as the Washington Post found. Drug trafficking is an inherently violent operation.

Francisco Melero (@franciscomelero) June 14, 2017,  The incident took place during an   protest in the municipality of Libertador, in which one person was killed and three others were injured. The Venezuelan military under Nicols Maduro has targeted underage protesters for years, killing unarmed adolescents at alarming rates. Among the earliest cases was the killing of another    Kluivert Roa, who was shot by police while demonstrating and was photographed lying in a pool of blood which caused outrage across social media. Both incidents are just two of numerous cases of   police brutality in Venezuela. So far, as many as 84 protesters, many of whom are teenagers, have been killed since daily   protests began in late March, as police use water cannons, rubber bullets, and smoke bombs to contain protesters. Last month, footage emerged of an armored car running over into a crowd of demonstrators after a firebomb was thrown at it.  Another striking image included a naked protester holding a bible was sprayed with rubber bullets by the police as he called for an end to the socialist regime. An audio recording obtained by the Miami Herald revealed a military general suggesting that police should start using sniper rifles to contain the protests. As many as eight Latin American countries have now signed a letter condemning an excessive use of force by Venezuelan authorities against civilians who are protesting government measures that affect democratic stability and cause the loss of human life.

Arrest warrants issued for Turkish security officials,CNN,Laura Koran,6/15/2017,"(CNN) Turkey has reacted angrily after US authorities issued arrest warrants for 12 of the Turkish Prime Minsters security detail over a bloody brawl during an official state visit in May. Police in Washington, DC, issued warrants Thursday for 12 of Recep Tayyip Erdogans security officers on a range of charges including aggravated assault and threatened assault in a menacing manner. The allegations stem from a brawl on the lawn outside the Turkish Ambassadors residence in the city, which has aggravated diplomatic tensions between the US and its longtime ally. Shortly after the clash, footage surfaced showing Erdogan watching events unfold from the residences driveway. On Thursday, he denied his security detail had done anything wrong and questioned the legality of the warrant.   They didnt do anything (to the protesters). In addition to that, yesterday, they detained two of our brothers who intervened. .. they issued arrest warrants for 12 of my security officials. What kind of law is this? What kind of legal system is this? he said. In total, 18 people have been charged or are facing charges over the incident. Of those, two were arrested Wednesday, two on the day in question and 14 are being sought. A statement issued by the Turkish Foreign Ministry said the decision to issue warrants was wrong, biased and lacks legal basis. It said the brawl was caused by the failure of local security authorities to take necessary measures, and that Turkish citizens cannot be held responsible. Street battle, Nine people were injured in the melee which erupted on May 16, though witness and Turkish  authorities have offered conflicting accounts of who was involved and who was to blame.  The Turkish embassy says the protesters were affiliated with the PKK (Kurdistan Workers Party), which is a designated terror group in Turkey, the US and Europe, and has been engaged in a   conflict with the Turkish government.  Turkey alleges the protesters began aggressively provoking   citizens who had peacefully assembled to greet the President.  According to protesters and video captured by the Voice of America Turkish service, men wearing suits and earpieces crossed a police line and attacked them.  DC Police Chief Peter Newsham strongly refuted the allegations Thursday, theres no indication at all that the protesters were a terrorist group. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert would not say whether the United States plans to seek the extradition of the security officials, who returned to Turkey prior to the completion of the investigation, avoiding arrest. However, she did note that their diplomatic immunity lapsed when they left the country, and they would be subject to arrest if they returned to the United States. The charges filed against 12 Turkish security officials sends a clear message that the United States does not tolerate individuals who use intimidation and violence to stifle freedom of speech and legitimate political expression, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said in a statement read to reporters by Nauert. The State Department will continue to work with law enforcement and the relevant legal authorities in the case. When an outcome is reached, the statement continued, the Department will determine if any additional steps will need to be taken. Nauert also said US Ambassador to Turkey, John Bass attended some meetings at the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs today in Turkey amid reports hed been summoned by Ankara. Last month the State Department summoned Turkeys ambassador over the incident, which one official called deeply disturbing. DC Police Chief Peter Newsham told reporters Thursday that investigators were able to identify the suspects using video footage. The charging documents reveal the suspects were identified by comparing screen captures from video footage shot at the protest to visa and passport images using facial recognition technology. Any additional actions regarding execution of these warrants will be weighed by the State Department as appropriate under relevant laws and regulations, he said, noting the State Department has been helpful in supporting the investigation, and insisting no one from the Turkish embassy has been implicated. Two of the 18 people charged or facing charges were arrested this week.  Sinan Narin of Virginia has been charged with two counts of assault for allegedly kicking a protester, who lost consciousness during the attack. Her recovery from bruising to the brain is expected to take six weeks. Eyup Yildirim was also arrested Wednesday, and his case is pending extradition from New Jersey. Two additional men, Jalal Kheirabaoi of Virginia and Ayten Necmi of New York, were arrested and charged immediately following the attack.    relations have s been strained by the United States refusal to extradite a Turkish cleric living in Pennsylvania, whom Erdogan blames for orchestrating a July 2016 coup attempt against him. And the two countries are at odds over Trumps decision to arm Kurdish militias that are helping in the fight to rout ISIS from its Syrian stronghold in Raqqa. Turkey sees these militias as an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which is considered a terrorist group in the United States, Turkey and Europe."
Whats the future of coal country? These grads arent sure,CNN,Drew Kann,6/15/2017,"(CNN) Straddling US Route 52 as it winds through the mountains of southern West Virginia, Iaeger is a town of just 350 residents.  United Shades of America with W. Kamau Bell explores the culture of Appalachias coal country this Sunday at 10 p. m.  . For most of his life, Cody DeLong has been one of them. McDowell County is the hometown that you see in all those high school football movies, said DeLong, 22. Its   roads. . .. We have one stoplight in the whole county. And the people are the greatest people youll ever meet in your life. A graduate of Concord University, DeLong said McDowell County was an excellent place to grow up.  But as he prepares to head to pharmacy school in the fall, hes not sure whether the home that shaped him    and gave him his love for hunting and fishing    will be a part of his future. The state, and this region in particular, has been hit particularly hard    from diminished demand for coal, long the economic bedrock of the region, to the opioid crisis gripping many rural towns. Most problematic for McDowell Countys future: People are leaving and not coming back. The loss of coal mining jobs has accelerated in recent years. In the fourth quarter of 2011, coal employed 26, 000 West Virginians. By the second quarter of 2016, that number had plummeted to just 12, 000.  In 1950, McDowell County had nearly 100, 000 residents, many of whom worked in the areas coal mines. Today, McDowell is one of the poorest counties in the country, with median household income under $25, 000 and just over 20, 000 people in the county.  West Virginia high school grads go to college at a lower rate than their American peers, with 55% enrollment, compared to 64% nationally.  With the future of southern West Virginia uncertain, we asked recent graduates from the region: Do they plan to stay in West Virginia to build a life and career, or do they feel the need to get out to succeed?  All the students we spoke with will enroll in college or have already graduated. Heres what six of them said about their futures    and that of their home. From the coalfields to Cambridge, Grace Bannister, 17, This fall, Logan Countys Grace Bannister is heading to a place worlds away from where she grew up: Harvard University.  I think theres a very large gap in the quality of life between where Im from and where Im going, she said. Bannister has lost family members to drug overdoses and seen her fathers mining supply company weather tough times to stay in business. Shes concerned about the future of her home. I almost feel like itll become like a ghost town because most of the population at this point is older, she said. At Harvard, Bannister plans to major in government or anthropology. Unlike some other recent graduates we spoke to, Bannister wants to be a part of the change she says her home needs.    I hope to someday come back and either try to make a difference working in the legal sector to help people get their lives on track, or Id really like to someday run for public office    maybe Senate or governor to try to help on a national level. They just want to jump on the bandwagon to make fun Cody DeLong, 22, His father, brother, uncles and several cousins have worked in southern West Virginias coal mines, but Cody DeLong plans to take a different path. This fall, DeLong will begin his first year at Marshall Universitys School of Pharmacy. When he finishes school, he doesnt think hell return home but he plans to settle somewhere in rural Appalachia.  Growing up in McDowell County and witnessing the toll that drug abuse took on many families led him to discover his lifes calling. There are a lot of doctors and pharmacists that    you cant really blame it all on them    but they really contribute to the big epidemic of opioid abuse that we have.

They dont really find any of the success stories, he said. They just want to jump on the bandwagon to make fun.  We basically had to start over from nothing  Joseph Hayes, 17, In 2001, as deadly floods swept through McDowell County, Joseph Hayes mother fetched him from day care in a panic before meeting his father and fleeing to higher ground. By the time the waters subsided, the familys home, dogs and nearly everything they owned was gone. We basically had to start over from nothing, Hayes said. With FEMAs assistance, Hayes and his family relocated to a trailer park near Welch, West Virginia, where he spent much of his childhood.  Despite the hardship, Hayes excelled in the classroom and on the football field. This fall, he will play football at Glenville State College. If his NFL dreams dont pan out, hed like to pursue a career in physical therapy. And though he says its unlikely, he remains open to the idea of returning to McDowell County. I hope things pick back up and do well, but the future right now isnt looking the best, he said. I want to come back, but I dont want to come back with nothing. I want to come back with something to help the people here. The tree hugger who is   Daniel Buchanan, 18, In Gilbert, West Virginia, where the mascot of nearby Mingo Central High School is the Miners, coal mining is a deeply entrenched way of life    one that Daniel Buchanan knows well. His father spent much of his life working in the mines. So when Buchanan says he wants to major in biology or environmental science, the potential conflicts between the livelihood of his hometown and his own future are obvious. But Buchanan doesnt see it that way. He says you can care about the natural world and also hope that coal returns to its former glory. A lot of people ask me the question, What are you going to do when you get older? I tell them that I want to do something with the environment, and the first thing they think is, Oh, so that means youre a tree hugger. But in reality, I am all for the coal mines, Buchanan said. Buchanan is open to the idea of returning to Mingo County after college, but feels that staking the hopes of the region on a rebounding coal industry is risky.  I think it would be wonderful if coal came back to where it was, say, 10 or 15 years ago. But we still need to diversify, he said. We need to have other options other than coal, because coal is not going to be around forever    its simple science.

Pino says her father struggled with mental disorders for years, but found success with treatment. And though he didnt finish college, he pushed his daughter to shine academically. After graduating at the top of her class this spring, Pino will attend West Virginia University in Morgantown, where she plans to major in psychology and work with people like her father.  [Psychological treatment] helped him turn his life around, so I would really love to do that for somebody else, she said. Pino isnt sure where shell settle to start her career but says it probably wont be in West Virginia. For me personally, I think I need to go somewhere a little more progressive, she said. Its just sort of sad to watch people so hopeful for even the current president to fix all the problems that we have here, and I dont see it happening. . ..

Memo to Donald Trump: The election ended 219 days ago. You won.,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/15/2017,"(CNN) On November 8, 2016, Donald Trump beat Hillary Clinton    the single biggest upset in modern American politics.  That was 219 days ago. And yet, on Thursday afternoon, Trump sent two tweets attacking his former opponent. Why is that Hillary Clintons family and Dems dealings with Russia are not looked at, but my   are? , Trump tweeted just before 4 p. m. eastern time.   He followed that up 12 minutes later with a second tweet: Crooked H destroyed phones   hammer, bleached emails,  had husband meet   days before she was    they talk about obstruction? What these twin tweets suggest is something we already knew: Trump just cant quit the 2016 election, and Clinton.  He spent weeks reveling in his stunning win. He reminded anyone who asked    and lots of people who didnt    that he had won over 300 electoral votes, a feat people said was impossible for any Republicans. As his 100th day in office approached, Trump handed out electoral maps to reporters coming to talk to him about what he had done for those first 100 days.  Huge framed electoral maps were shown being brought into the White House. The 2016 election represented Trumps greatest triumph, his lifes work: Proving that all the elites who mocked him or said he couldnt do something were mistaken all along. They had to eat their words. He was right. Everyone else was wrong. The end. Then theres the fact that Trump also works better when he has someone or something to run against. In Clinton, he found a perfect opponent    someone as cautious as he was risky, someone as insider as he was outsider, someone as mannered as he was unruly. It makes sense then that in one of the darkest moments of his presidency to date    following The Washington Posts report Wednesday night that special counsel Bob Mueller was investigating Trump for obstruction of justice    that Trump would return to his best memories and his most reliable foil. The problem for Trump is that he won the election. Its over. Has been for a long time. (We are now closer to November 2017 than we are to November 2016.) In winning, he became the president. And what the current president does or has done matters a whole lot more than what a losing candidate for president does, in the eyes of our criminal and legal systems. (Thats not unique to Trump. Many members of Congress    of both parties    have resigned in the face of legal problems, knowing that a former House member is a lot less juicy of a target than a sitting one.) Then there are the specifics of the allegations Trump is making against Clinton in his tweets. In his first tweet about Russia ties, the story I think Trump is referring to is this one, which ran in The New York Times in April 2015 and was headlined: Cash Flowed to Clinton Foundation Amid Russian Uranium Deal. At issue was the fact that a number of Canadians who had been major donors to the Clinton Foundation had sold their company to a Russian company named Rosatom.  Heres the key paragraph: As the Russians gradually assumed control of Uranium One in three separate transactions from 2009 to 2013, Canadian records show, a flow of cash made its way to the Clinton Foundation. Uranium Ones chairman used his family foundation to make four donations totaling $2. 35 million. Those contributions were not publicly disclosed by the Clintons, despite an agreement Mrs. Clinton had struck with the Obama White House to publicly identify all donors. Other people with ties to the company made donations as well. The Clinton Foundation admitted it had made disclosure errors. The allegation that Clinton, as secretary of state, could have vetoed the sale was found to be false by Factcheck. org. Trumps second tweet deals with a series of findings aired in the 2016 campaign. The smashing of phones with a hammer and bleaching emails comes from the FBIs report into her private email server. The other charge deals with Bill Clintons decision to meet with then Attorney General Loretta Lynch while their planes idled on the tarmac.  Fired FBI Director James Comey said in congressional testimony last week that he believed that meeting was not appropriate. He also detailed the fact that Lynch had told him to refer to the Clinton email investigation as  matter and not an investigation    an ask that gave him a queasy feeling. What Trump is arguing is, essentially, that the questions about the uranium mine sale and the plane visit should take precedence over the hoax that is the investigation into Russias meddling in the 2016 election, potential collusion with his campaign and the possibility that he obstructed justice in the probe. That is, of course, a matter of personal opinion    and one Trump is very much entitled to. But remember that the special counsel was appointed by the deputy attorney general within the Trump administration. Bob Mueller was deputy AG Rod Rosensteins pick, not Clintons, or anyone elses. This was not a partisan action.  Trump is a victim of his own success here.  He won the election. He is the President    and the most powerful person in the country. That means he gets a level of scrutiny no one else does. Particularly when there is so much smoke swirling regarding the ties between Russia and his campaign, and his decision to fire Comey in the midst of a federal investigation into those allegations. Trump can try to distract. He can try to deflect. He can complain about Clintons alleged transgressions. But what he cant change is the fact that he is President, and this investigation isnt going to disappear just because he sent two    or two hundred    tweets about Clinton."
Doctors: Ex-North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier has severe brain injury,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,6/15/2017,"(CNN) Doctors caring for released North Korea detainee Otto Warmbier said he has not spoken or moved on his own since he arrived in the United States on Tuesday, a condition they described as unresponsive wakefulness or persistent vegetative state.  The    has suffered extensive loss of brain tissue in all regions of the brain, doctors at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center said in a news conference Thursday.  Also known as persistent vegetative state, the syndromes symptoms include no voluntary movement or awareness of surroundings. Warmbier opens his eyes and blinks spontaneously but shows no signs of understanding language or responding to verbal commands, said Dr. Daniel Kanter, professor of neurology and director of the Neurocritical Care Program. The news shed light on the Warmbier familys statement that their son suffered severe brain damage at some point in his 17 months of detention. His parents said they learned of their sons condition    what North Korea called a coma    only last week. Earlier Thursday, Fred Warmbier said he rejected the regimes explanation that his son fell into a coma after contracting botulism and taking a sleeping pill in March 2016 after his trial for trying to steal a political banner. The doctors said they had no information about the care he received in North Korea. Though they could not say with certainty what caused his injuries, they found no evidence to support the botulism claim. But an analysis of images from North Korea of Warmbiers brain dated April 2016 suggests the injury occurred in the preceding weeks. We have no certifiable knowledge of the cause or circumstances of his neurological injuries, Kanter said. This pattern of brain injury is usually seen as result of cardiopulmonary arrest where blood supply to (the) brain is inadequate for a period of time, resulting in the death of brain tissue. Conviction and release  Otto Warmbier was a University of Virginia student when he was detained in January 2016 at Pyongyang airport on his way home. He had been on a tour of the reclusive country, his parents said. North Korean authorities claimed they had security footage of him trying to steal a banner containing a political slogan that was hanging from a wall of his Pyongyang hotel. That was used as evidence in his hourlong trial. He was found guilty of committing a hostile act against the country and sentenced in March 2016 to 15 years of hard labor. It was the last time he was seen publicly before this week. Even if you believe their explanation of botulism and a sleeping pill causing a coma    and we dont    there is no excuse for any civilized nation to have kept his condition a secret and denied him   medical care for so long, said Fred Warmbier in a   news conference at his sons alma mater, Wyoming High School, north of Cincinnati. The father saluted his son as a brilliant, adventurous and courageous man who did what he could to endure brutality and terror. The father, wearing the cream sport coat his son wore during his televised trial in North Korea, stopped short of saying how he believed his son was injured. Were going to leave that to the doctors today, he said. Though they could not provide a specific cause, the doctors said Warmbier showed spastic, profound weakness and contractions in his muscles and legs. Beyond minor skin blemishes consistent with medical care they found no evidence of fractures or trauma to his body. Nor did they find evidence of botulism, a toxin that causes nerve injury, Dr. Brandon Foreman said. Because it does not stay in the body for long doctors looked for signs of chronic denervation, which is loss of nerve supply, he said. We did not find any evidence of that. US lawmakers want to ban American tourists from North Korea, Critical of Obama administration, Fred Warmbier appeared critical of the Obama administrations handling of Ottos detention, saying the family heeded the US governments initial advice to take a low profile without result.  They kept quiet on the false premise that (North Korea) would treat Otto fairly and let him go, he said. He said he and his wife, Cindy, decided this year that the time for strategic patience was over, and so they did media interviews and traveled to Washington to meet the State Departments special representative for North Korean policy, Joseph Yun. Yun met in May with North Korean representatives in Norway, and the North Koreans agreed that Swedish representatives would be allowed to visit Otto Warmbier and three other US detainees, a senior State Department official said on condition of anonymity this week. After the Swedes visited one detainee, North Korea representatives sought another meeting with Yun, and it was at that June 6 meeting in New York that North Koreas UN ambassador told Yun that Warmbier was in a coma, the official said. North Korea released Warmbier six days later. Fred Warmbier praised the Trump administrations efforts: They have our thanks for bringing Otto home. When asked whether   Barack Obama could have done more, Warmbier replied, I think the results speak for themselves. Three other US detainees, Warmbiers release coincided with basketball star Dennis Rodmans latest visit to North Korea, though US national security spokesman Michael Anton said there is no connection between the two. Fred Warmbier said the same Thursday. Dennis Rodman had nothing to do with Otto, he said. Rodman was asked by reporters Tuesday if he would bring up the cases of Warmbier and three other Americans detained in North Korea. Thats not my purpose right now, he said. My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea. The other Americans held by Pyongyang are Kim Sang Duk and Kim   academics who worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology, and a businessman named Kim Dong Chul. Fred Warmbier called on North Korea to release other American detainees. Theres no excuse for the way the North Koreans treated our son. And no excuse for the way theyve treated so many others, he said. No other family should have to endure what the Warmbiers have."
Dems win annual baseball game with special meaning,CNN,Jeremy Herb,6/15/2017,"(CNN) Democrats easily defeated Republicans   in the 2017 Congressional Baseball Game, in an annual tradition that has taken on renewed importance in the wake of Wednesdays shooting in Alexandria, Virginia. One day after a gunman opened fire at a Republican congressional baseball practice, shooting House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and three others, lawmakers took the field Thursday evening at Nationals Park in Washington. The annual Congressional Baseball Game pits Republicans against Democrats, but this year the focus has turned to showing unity in the wake of the shooting. Interest in the charity baseball game has skyrocketed in the aftermath of the shooting, as staffers and lawmakers look to rally around Scalise and the three others who were shot: a congressional staffer, a lobbyist and a Capitol Police special agent. At the end of the game when Democratic manager Pennsylvania Rep. Mike Doyle was presented the winning trophy, he called Republican manager Texas Rep. Joe Barton to join him. Doyle gave the winning trophy back to the Republicans to put in Scalises office. There were 24, 959 tickets sold, which was a record for the game that was first played in 1909. More than $1 million has been raised this year for Congressional Sports for Charity. Ivanka Trump, joined by Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and her two eldest children Arabella and Joseph Kushner, presented a $50, 000 check from Friends in the Trump Administration to Congressional Sports for Charity at the game.  The game raised about $500, 000 for charity last year, according to spokeswoman Meredith Raimondi. Pushing that message of unity were the House leaders Speaker Paul Ryan and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who told CNNs Jake Tapper on CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront that despite party affiliation they were both on Team Scalise. Congressional baseball practice shooting: What we know about the victims, Former New York Yankees manager Joe Torre presented the game ball to Capitol Police special agent David Bailey, who came out on the field on crutches after being injured in Wednesdays shooting, to throw out the first pitch to huge applause. President Donald Trump sent a video message to the game, highlighting Scalise who remains in critical condition on Thursday after several surgeries. By playing tonight, you are showing the world that we will not be intimidated by threats, acts of violence, or assaults on our democracy, Trump said. The game will go on. The Washington Nationals released additional seating in at the stadium to accommodate the demand. Instead of wearing hats representing their home teams, as is the normal tradition, players on both teams wore Louisiana State University hats in honor of Scalise, a Louisiana Republican, for part of the game. Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona, who was at Wednesdays practice and gave medical help after the shooting, said it would have been awful if the game had been canceled, and said Scalise would want it to go on. I hope hes in good enough shape to watch, because hell certainly feel good about what he sees, Flake said. I was there at the hospital last night, and I hope hes doing better today. Its a long road for him. RELATED: Heres how to watch the Congressional Baseball Game, Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana was the Democrats star pitcher, and a close friend of Scalises. The two have enjoyed a   ribbing over the game, which Republicans won last year to break a   Democratic win streak. Ill miss the banter with him back and forth, but Im sure theres some substitutes over there I can go pick a fight with, Richmond told reporters. Itll be a different game without him there. But Flake said the final score wasnt likely to matter this year. As far as winning and losing, I think thats far from anybodys mind right now, he said."

Chuck Todd on VA Shooting: We Are All to Blame for the Toxic Stew of Political Discourse - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/14/2017,"Wednesday on MSNBCs MTP Daily, host Chuck Todd reacted to the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA, saying that we were all to blame.   Todd said, Folks, some want to blame the left or the right or us in the media. But heres who it seems too many folks dont want to blame themselves. We are all to blame. This toxic stew that passes for political discourse seems beyond repair in the current moment. Just look at social media.  For too long, our collective politics has demonized the other side for caustic behavior while rationalizing that same behavior when it comes from someone who shares their politics, he continued.

"Limbaugh: Virginia Shooter the Personification of the Lunatic Fringe Base, the Deranged Base of the Democrat Party - Breitbart",Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/14/2017,"Wednesday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to a shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that had resulted in five people hospitalized, including House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( ).  Limbaugh argued the shooter, identified as James T. Hodgkinson of Illinois, was influenced by the media and the Democratic Party stoking hatred and resentment. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): The sad and unfortunate fact is that, as evidenced by the sound bite of me yesterday, I have foreseen this coming. You cant continue to enrage people the way the left, and predominantly the media, has been doing. The Democrat Party and the left for years have been feeding this. And particularly since the election of Trump they have virtually assured their supporters that Trump is guilty, guilty of treason. And every congressional hearing is going to provide the proof. Every one. Sessions yesterday, Comey a couple of times, Sally Yates, you name it. They build up these expectations that Trump is not really the president. He shouldnt have been. He cheated. He colluded with the Russians. There isnt any evidence for it, and so every time the left builds up an event where this is going to be established as fact and it blows up in their faces, it creates rising expectations followed immediately by rank disappointment and anger and letdown over the fact that its not happening. And I think these people on the left have been driven to this extreme for quite a while. I have been worried about it for I dont know how long. And Ive been telling you so. And we could, if we wanted to, we could scour     well, we have. I could go back and show you tweets, I could read you tweets. I could read you statements made by elected Democrats and others promoting just this kind of behavior, just this kind of behavior. You can find it. If you look at the TV programs and the media personalities that this guy, Hodgkinson, was devoted to, youll find out how radicalized he was by   TV and comedy. Last week Tonight With John Oliver, the Nightly Show on the Comedy Central, Democracy Now, The Ed Show, the Rachel Maddow Show. He apparently loved Rachel Maddow, wanted her to run for president. The Daily Show on Comedy Central, Real Time with Bill Maher. Those are the TV shows that he recommended everybody watch. Clearly, he was radicalized. Now, I also want to say he probably started off this way. I dont know that this guys ever been a rational, invisible functioning member of a community, but at some point he got radicalized, and if you dig deep youll find     weve got examples of it to share with you. This guy is the exact personification when I sit here and talk about the lunatic fringe base, the deranged base of the Democrat Party, this is the guy. This is the face. This is the picture. This is what you get when you stoke and fuel hatred, raw hatred and resentment, at some point its gonna blow over, because it cannot be contained, this kind of rage and repeated disappointment. You add climate change probably to this guys list of grievances, and I think everybody ought to take a step back and realize this guy is not isolated. This guy is probably typical. Not that theres going to be rampant shootings, but he just happened to go over the edge and pull the trigger. But he, to me, is exactly what I am unfortunately worried about when I look at the way all of these lies and all these nothingness, nothing burger stories have now been out there for month after month after month. And you add everything else that the Democrat and the liberal media agenda is. Its nothing but anger, its nothing but rage, its nothing but hatred, and it has to have an outlet. And they know it.

Newt Gingrich: Virginia Shooting Part of a Pattern of Increasing Intensity of Hostility on the Left - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/14/2017,"Wednesday on Fox News Channels Outnumbered, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich attributed the shooting at a congressional baseball practice in Alexandria, VA that had resulted in five people hospitalized, including House Majority Whip Rep.

I dont think any of us expected today to take this turn. But its part of a pattern, as you saw the sign this guy was holding. Youve had an increasing intensity of hostility on the left. Look, I talk to college students regularly who say to me if they are openly for Trump, they get threatened.  The intensity on the left is very real, he added. Whether it is somebody, as   comedian, holding up the presidents head in blood or its right here in New York City, a play that shows the president being assassinated, or its Democratic leading national politicians who are so angry they have to use vulgarity because they can find any common language to talk. This intensity I think has been building since election night.  Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
Ayaan Hirsi Ali to Congress: Political Islam Incompatible with the U.S. Constitution,Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/14/2017,"WASHINGTON, DC     Political Islam, focused on establishing an unfree society ruled by strict sharia law, is fundamentally incompatible with the U. S. Constitution and the overall foundation of the American way of life, declared Ayaan Hirsi Ali, an expert at the Hoover Institution think tank, during a Senate panel hearing. [Meanwhile, Michael Leiter, the former director of the U. S. National Counterterrorism Center, argued that sharia law is compatible with the American Constitution.  Muslims honoring of Sharia is not inherently in tangent with living in constitutional democracies anymore than it would be for Christians or Jews who also seek to honor their religious traditions while still complying with civil authority, testified Leiter. The     Ali     an honor violence victim, a strong advocate against female genital mutilation (FGM) and author     strongly disagreed. During a hearing on Islamic ideology and terror held by the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee Wednesday, Ali testified alongside the former U. S. official who served under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. My central argument is that political Islam implies a constitutional order fundamentally incompatible with the US Constitution and with the constitution of liberty that is the foundation of the American way of life, proclaimed Ali in her written testimony. She later stressed, Let it be said explicitly: the Islamists program is fundamentally incompatible with the US Constitution, religious tolerance, the equality of men and women, the tolerance of different sexual orientations, the ban on cruel and unusual punishment and other fundamental human rights.  Ali explained that intimidation and advancing the goal of imposing Islamic law (sharia) on society are fundamental tenets of political Islam. She noted that Islamism is the ideology that drives political Islam and dawa provides the means by which it is spread, adding: The term dawa refers to activities carried out by Islamists to win adherents and enlist them in a campaign to impose sharia law on all societies. Dawa is not the Islamic equivalent of religious proselytizing, although it is often disguised as such by blending humanitarian activities with subversive political activities       The ultimate goal of dawa is to destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with strict sharia. Islamists rely on both violent and nonviolent means to achieve their objectives. The strategy used by the United States to combat violent Islamic extremism has failed because it has solely focused on acts of violence while ignoring the ideology that drives jihadists and Islamists, argued Ali. She told lawmakers, The dominant strategy from   through the present, focusing only on Islamist violence, has failed. In focusing only on acts of violence, we have ignored the ideology that justifies, promotes, celebrates, and encourages violence, and the methods of dawa used to spread that ideology.  In order to reverse its failure, the United States has to fight a war of ideas against political Islam (or Islamism) as an ideology and against those who spread that ideology, advised Ali. President Donald Trump advocating for an ideological campaign against radical Islam is refreshing and heartening, testified Ali, adding, This deserves to be called a paradigm shift.  She noted that Trumps position marks a departure from his predecessors. Ali pointed out that Islam is on the rise across the world and jihadist groups have proliferated despite the U. S. spending at least $3. 6 trillion on combat and reconstruction costs in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan and sacrificing more than 5, 000 American service members and the tens of thousands of wounded U. S. troops. According to one estimate, 1015 percent of the worlds Muslims are Islamists. Out of well over 1. 6 billion, or 23 percent of the globes population, that implies more than 160 million individuals, mentioned Ali. Based on survey data on attitudes toward sharia in Muslim countries, total support for Islamist activities in the world is likely significantly higher than that estimate."

Scalise remains in critical condition after shooting,CNN,Tal Kopan,6/14/2017,"Washington (CNN) Rep. Steve Scalise, a congressional staffer, a lobbyist and a member of the Capitol police force were shot Wednesday in Alexandria, Virginia, during a Republicans   practice ahead of a charity baseball game.  Federal law enforcement officials identified the alleged shooter as James Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Illinois, who died following a shootout with authorities.  At least six people including Scalise, the third ranking member of House Republican leadership as the majority whip, were hospitalized.  Scalise was in critical condition after suffering damage to internal organs, and his injuries will require additional operations, according to a MedStar Washington Hospital Center medical update late Wednesday. Congressman Steve Scalise sustained a single rifle shot to the left hip. The bullet traveled across his pelvis, fracturing bones, injuring internal organs, and causing severe bleeding, MedStar said in a statement put out by Scalises office. He underwent immediate surgery, and an additional procedure to stop bleeding. He has received multiple units of blood transfusion. His condition is critical, and he will require additional operations. We will provide periodic updates. A congressional staffer, Zach Barth, was also shot in the leg and has since been released from the hospital. Matt Mika, a lobbyist for Tyson Foods and former congressional staffer, was also identified as one of those shot. He was out of surgery and in critical condition as of Wednesday afternoon, his family said in a statement. House Speaker Paul Ryan said two members of the Capitol Police    Crystal Griner and David Bailey    were injured Wednesday.  In a statement, Capitol Police said Griner was in good condition in the hospital having been shot in the ankle, and Bailey was treated and released having sustained a minor injury during the incident. Trump made a surprise visit to MedStar Washington Hospital Center around sunset Wednesday. He sat next to Scalises bed and spoke with the congressmans family, according to White House press secretary Sean Spicer. He also spoke with Griner and her wife, as well as hospital doctors. A senior administration official said the mood inside the hospital was somber during Trumps visit, which came hours after Scalise emerged from surgery still in critical condition after suffering a single rifle shot to his hip. Rep. Roger Williams, a Texas Republican whom Barth works for, was also hospitalized and released with an injury to his leg.  Lawmakers described a chaotic scene during the shooting. Many members of the congressional GOP baseball team were huddled in a dugout while Capitol police    who were part of Scalises security detail    and local Alexandria police engaged in a shootout with Hodgkinson. Congressional and law enforcement sources described it as a deliberate attack.  Traces were still being done on the two firearms recovered at the scene    an SKS rifle and a 9 mm pistol on Wednesday, a law enforcement source tells CNN. House Republican and Democratic leaders called for unity, while President Donald Trump said in an address from the White House that the prayers of the nation and world are with Scalise. Congressman Scalise is a friend, and a very good friend, Trump said. Hes a patriot. And hes a fighter. He will recover from this assault    and Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation, and frankly the entire world. America is praying for you and America is praying for all of the victims of this terrible shooting. Ryan condemned the shooting and praised the Capitol Police on the House floor later Wednesday. We are united. We are united in our shock. We are united in our anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us, Ryan said, drawing a bipartisan standing ovation. Members practicing for traditional baseball game, Members of Congress were practicing for a charity baseball game that was scheduled for Thursday night at Nationals Park. Rep. Martha McSally,   said the game will still go on as scheduled. The annual game has been played since 1909, and McSally said lawmakers applauded the announcement at an   meeting. RELATED: A short history of the Congressional Baseball Game, Rep. Joe Barton, who manages the Republican team, told reporters that the Fallen Officers Fund has been added to the charities that will receive the proceeds. Rep. Mike Doyle, who manages the Democratic team, said at the same conference that his team would host the Republican team at the Democratic club for dinner to reflect Wednesday.  Some of them have probably never set foot in that building, he joked. Lawmakers describe a terrifying scene, Lawmakers who spoke at the scene to reporters described a normal morning practice taking place at a field where theyve practiced for years, when suddenly shots rang out. Lawmakers, staff members and even the young son of one of the members ran for cover, jumping into dugouts and over fences to avoid the gunshots.  Members described Scalise dragging himself roughly 15 yards away from second base, where he had been playing, and lying there until the shooter was neutralized, at which point some of them ran to assist him until he could be evacuated. Once they were able, Sen. Jeff Flake said he and Rep. Brad Wenstrup, who is a physician, went to where Scalise was lying to apply pressure to the wound. Scalise was coherent the whole time, Flake said. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul told CNN it would have been a massacre without the Capitol Police officers present. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police, Paul said on CNN. It would have been a massacre without them. We had nothing but baseball bats to fight back against a rifle with, Alabama Rep. Mo Brooks said. Flake added that he saw a member of Scalises security detail return fire on the gunman for what felt like 10 minutes, even though the police officer was wounded in the leg. RELATED: GOP pitcher chokes back tears as he reflects on teammates camaraderie, Fifty (shots) would be an understatement, Im quite sure, Flake said when asked about the total amount of gunfire, including police returning fire. Brooks said the shooter was behind the third base dugout and didnt say anything. Shooter identified, Hodgkinsons Facebook page is largely political, and his profile picture is a caricature of Bernie Sanders as Uncle Sam.   The Facebook feed is filled with   sentiments such as Trump is guilty and should go to prison for treason.  He also liked a political cartoon that suggested that Scalise should be fired. On March 22, he posted Trump is a Traitor. Trump Has Destroyed Our Democracy. Its Time to Destroy Trump  Co. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders said both in a statement and on the Senate floor that he had learned the shooter had volunteered on his Democratic presidential campaign    and that he condemned the shooting in the strongest possible terms. I have just been informed that the alleged shooter at the Republican baseball practice is someone who apparently volunteered on my presidential campaign, Sanders said. I am sickened by this despicable act. Let me be as clear as I can be. Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms, he said. Real change can only come about through nonviolent action, and anything else runs against our most deeply held American values. Capitol Hill increases security, cancels events, The news of the shooting reverberated on Capitol Hill, where security was increased and many regular proceedings were canceled or postponed. In his remarks, Ryan also said hed been moved by an image of members of the Democratic congressional baseball team huddled in prayer after learning of the shooting. Every day we come here to test and to challenge each other. We feel so deeply about the things that we fight for and the things that we believe in. At times, our emotions can clearly get the best of us. We are all imperfect. But we do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber. For all the noise and all the fury, we are one family, Ryan said. The House decided to not hold any votes on legislation Wednesday, and many hearings were delayed. The House Natural Resources Federal Lands Subcommittee also canceled a scheduled meeting to debate gun legislation.  Capitol Hill Police notified congressional offices that the security presence on the Hill would be increased out of an abundance of caution. Members of Congress targeted in the past by violence, Scalise is the first member of Congress to be shot since former Arizona Rep. Gabby Giffords in January 2011. Giffords was shot in the head by Jared Lee Loughner at a Congress On Your Corner event outside a Tucson grocery store. Giffords, who authorities said was the main target of the shooting, survived the attack, but six others were killed and an additional 12 were injured.  RELATED: Steve Scalise is the 9th sitting member of Congress to be shot, Loughner pleaded guilty in 2012 and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this report misidentified this size of the a pistol recovered from the scene of the shooting. It was a 9 mm pistol. An earlier version of this story incorrectly described the SKS rifle."
Jeff Sessions explanation for firing Comey just doesnt make sense,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/14/2017,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions tried to have his cake and eat it too when it came to his explanations during congressional testimony Tuesday for the firing of FBI Director James Comey. On the one hand, Sessions didnt feel like he needed to stay in the Oval Office on February 14 when President Trump said he wanted to speak privately with Comey. And he didnt feel the need to do anything following a meeting the two men had in the days that followed in which Comey expressed his discomfort with these    conversations with the president. Sessions justification in both instances was that Comey was a total pro, that he knew his stuff and that Sessions trusted him to handle his business. I felt (Comey) so long in the department    former deputy attorney general, as I recall    knew those policies probably a good deal better than I did, said Sessions at one point. At another, Sessions said: Our Department of Justice rules on proper communications between the department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them, I thought and assumed, correctly, that he complied with them. On the other hand, Sessions told the Senate intelligence committee that he and deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein had discussed removing Comey as FBI director and agreed that it was time for a fresh start at the bureau before either man was confirmed to their current positions. Huh? Either Comey was the ultimate pro who could be trusted to handle his business or he was someone who Sessions had decided months before needed to go because he had badly mismanaged his role in the 2016 election. Comey cant simultaneously be highly competent and a bungling, bumbling fool depending on what image suits Sessions needs at the moment. But, time and again, Sessions tried to hold those totally oppositional thoughts in his head    and insisted that they werent at all contradictory.  As Sen. Jack Reed,   Island, noted in Tuesdays hearing, in July and again in October    following Comeys initial announcement that Hillary Clinton had been extremely careless in her handling of her private email server and his decision to   the case in October    Sessions praised the then FBI director.  This exchange between Reed and Sessions is telling: REED: So, in July and November, Director Comey was doing exactly the right thing. You had no criticism of him. You felt that in fact he was a skilled professional prosecutor. You felt that his last statement in October was fully justified. So how can you go from those statements to agreeing with Mr. Rosenstein and then asking the President, or recommending he be fired? SESSIONS: I think, in retrospect, as all of us begin to look at that clearly and talk about it, as perspectives of the Department of Justice, once the director had first got involved and embroiled in a public discussion of this investigation, which would have been better never to have been discussed publicly, and said he    it was over. Then when he found new evidence that came up, I think he probably was required to tell Congress that it wasnt over, that new evidence had been developed. Uh, what? If you get what Sessions is driving at in his response to Reed, you are a better    and smarter    person than me.  (Also worth noting: Comey testified, under oath, that Trump called him several times in the first part of this year to tell him how great a job he was doing.) Then there was the fact, revealed in Sessions testimony yesterday, that he had never met with Comey to discuss what he took to be his poor performance.   This back and forth with Mark Warner,   the vice chairman of the intelligence committee, gets at that oddity: WARNER: So you were his    his superior, and there were some fairly harsh things said about Director Comey. You never thought it was appropriate to raise those concerns before he was actually terminated by the President? SESSIONS: I did not do so. A memorandum was prepared by the deputy attorney general, who evaluated his performance and noted some serious problems with it.  Take one giant step back. We know, because Donald Trump told us, that the real reason he fired Comey was because of the former FBI directors approach to the Russia investigation. Trump said that after his administration had tried to sell the same case Sessions was selling on Tuesday: That Comey was removed because of a memo from Rosenstein. Thats the fact. Everything else    including Sessions attempts to spin his views on Comey and the circumstances surrounding his firing    are simply   spin."
E3 Hands-On with Agents of Mayhem: Saints Row Follow-Up Feels Criminally Underwhelming - Breitbart,Breitbart,Nate Church,6/14/2017,"Volition stakes its Seoul on the success of this   successor to the world of Saints Row, but Agents of Mayhem doesnt leave a great first impression. [Agents of Mayhem takes place in a   Row future, though its unclear just how much influence that the purple gangsters of developer Volitions previous   crime series have had on the MAYHEM  . Still, their membership includes both Pierce and the   (and presumably resurrected) Johnny Gat from previous Saints games, so we arent straying too far from Volitions ongoing universe of sandbox mayhem.   After the viral success of Saints Row 4s   hijinks, the development team has decided to double down on slapstick anarchy. Agents of Mayhem offers at least ten different playable characters, each with their own skills, strengths, weaknesses, and upgrade paths. Choosing the right three for a given mission, which you can then switch between playing as on the fly, into a futuristic parody of Seoul will be crucial to success. Mission difficulty is extremely scalable, allowing you to balance risk versus reward before youve pulled the trigger. On the ground, swapping between said squadmates is instantaneous and allows for powerful combinations of both active and passive abilities. Its more than choosing the right weapon for the job     knowing who is better at disrupting shields, who can punch through armor, and who has a penchant for computer hacking is an important part of deciding who hits the streets. Vehicle gameplay doesnt look especially impressive or robust, but it remains present. Whether or not its worth the time to slip into one of the many vehicles on the streets of Seoul remains to be seen, but Saints Row 4 rendered automotive transportation utterly pointless with its   hijinks so there may not be much reason for concern. Agents of Mayhem recalls nothing so much as an especially crude Saturday morning cartoon, with easily as many   as bullets. Volitions recent games have always had a sense of humor that can be hit or miss, but the humor is (mostly) endearing. Agents of Mayhem doesnt stick with me as much as past efforts in the demo I played, but I could see myself growing attached to members of the crew given time. Unfortunately, the games promise seems to have stalled after the concept stage. When I sat down to actually play, I found a game that felt like the leftover missions from an   title, with none of the freedom that implies. Though my team was aesthetically different, playing each of them was an exercise in holding down the trigger until the bloated life bars of faceless enemies depleted, and I moved to the next checkpoint. There were hints of progression     you can collect vehicles, experience, and shards. But the vehicles felt pointless, and I didnt have enough time with the game to stretch my legs with some of the advancement. Switching between characters has all the gravity of weapon swapping. On one hand, it wasnt cumbersome. On the other, it just didnt seem to matter very much. The games visuals were similarly uninspired. Everything is just a little too smooth. Character models are simple, stiffly animated, and overly shiny, making the game feel more like an HD remake of a   title than the heir apparent to a beloved franchise. The animated cutscenes felt more like a storyboard   for real cinematics than something to ship with a finished title. As an ardent fan of the Saints Row franchise, Agents of Mayhem felt criminally underwhelming. Given some time in the open world, with a wider variety of team members and the opportunity to play with the character advancement system, my opinion could change. For now, however, all it did was make me wish for a true successor to the absurdly creative GTA knockoff that inspired it."
Terry McAuliffe: Alexandria Shooting Proves We Have Too Many Guns on the Street - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/14/2017,"Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe (D) responded to the news of the shooting in Alexandria by saying it proves we have too many guns on the street.

Former New York Times assistant managing editor Jim Roberts quoted McAuliffe as saying: There are too many guns on the street      we worry about this every day for all of our citizens, and BuzzFeed DC editor Sarah Mimms tweeted: VA Gov. McAuliffe: We lose 93       people per day due to gun violence, mentions background checks, gun show loophole.     Sarah Mimms (@SarahMMimms) June 14, 2017,  The 93 people a day claim is a talking point shared by gun control proponents throughout the U. S. Everytown for Gun Safety, Moms Demand Action, Hillary Clinton, and similar groups and individuals have been making for years. They repeatedly state more than 90 people are killed by gun violence in America every day. But in reality, the number of people killed annually by homicidal firearm use is about a third of that figure. Individuals like McAuliffe swell the number of deaths via gun violence by adding   suicides to homicides, more than doubling the number of people who are actually murdered with a firearm. Interestingly enough, Mimms reported that McAuliffe first said 93 million people [are killed] per day, but he corrected that statement.

Uber board member resigns after making a sexist comment at a meeting intended to address sexism at the company,Business Insider,Troy Wolverton,6/14/2017,"Uber board member David Bonderman resigned from the   companys board on Tuesday after making a sexist comment during a   company meeting earlier in the day.     Bondermans  which played on a stereotype that women   talk too much, came amid a discussion about the steps the     company plans to take to address complaints about   sexism and gender discrimination in its ranks. He apologized soon   after making the statement, but seemed to recognize later   that an apology wasnt enough.     Today at Ubers   meeting, I directed a comment to my   colleague and friend Arianna Huffington that was careless,   inappropriate, and inexcusable, Bonderman said in a statement.   The comment came across in a way that was the opposite of what I   intended, but I understand the destructive effect it had, and I   take full responsibility for that.     His resignation,  will take effect   Wednesday morning.      In a separate statement, board member Ariana Huffington thanked   Bonderman for stepping down.      I appreciate David doing the right thing for Uber at this time   of critical cultural changes at the company, she said.     Bondermans departure is only the latest bit of turmoil at   Uber.

On Tuesday, Uber released to employees a report put together by   former US Attorney General Eric Holder. Holder and his firm   investigated the companys workplace environment in response   to Fowlers complaints and came up with a list of recommendations   for how Uber could improve its culture. The board was discussing   those recommendations with employees when Bonderman made his   comment.

Nikki Haley Blasts U.N. Human Rights Office for Unfair Bias Against Israel in Latest Report,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/14/2017,"U. S Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley has blasted a new U. N. report that attacks Israeli actions in the Middle East, in what she says is the latest sign of the U. N.s unfair bias in how it handles the   conflict. [The report, from the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, was submitted in response to a resolution by the Human Rights Council     a body which Haley has repeatedly criticized for its own   bias and the questionable human rights record of some of its members.  The report, titled, Ensuring accountability and justice for all violations of international law in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, evaluates Israels compliance with a number of U. N. resolutions and reports, including demands to deconstruct its security barrier on the West Bank, which has been credited with massively reducing terrorist attacks. The report adds: The High Commissioner notes the repeated failure to comply with the calls for accountability made by the entire human rights system and urges Israel to conduct prompt, impartial and independent investigations of all alleged violations of international human rights law and all allegations of international crimes. Furthermore, the High Commissioner calls upon Israel to ensure that all victims have access to remedies and reparation. The report also notes previous recommendations, including an   boycott call for investigations of the activities of companies and financial institutions profiting from Israeli settlements, and for such practices to be ended and for reparation to be provided to Palestinians affected.  Haley took issue with the reports focus on Israel, noting that it brushed over terror attacks by Hamas and other terrorist groups attacking Israel, and ignored the human rights abuses of other countries. This report is just the latest example of the Human Rights Council singling out Israel rather than focusing on the worlds actual human rights abusers, she said in a statement. Not only does it undermine the credibility of the Human Rights Council on human rights issues, but it once again highlights the unfair bias of the UN when it comes to the   conflict, she said. Haley also took issue with the recommendation that the U. N. General Assembly ask the International Court of Justice to issue an advisory opinion on Israel, something her office says is out of the purview of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Israels Ambassador to the U. N. Danny Danon also condemned the report, saying, This obsession with Israel has crossed all lines.  Danon accused the office of offering to advise and support efforts to create what he called a blacklist database of companies working in the region so that the international community could threaten a boycott. The latest report comes a week after Haley visited the Human Rights Councils headquarters in Geneva and warned that the U. S. could leave the council if it didnt reform its voting and bias against Americas ally in the Middle East. The same week, Breitbart News reported on an upcoming report by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia and submitted in the name of Secretary General Antonio Guterres, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks in the West Bank so as to entrench Israels presence.

[Breitbart News reported that five persons were injured when    James T. Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican House and Senate members who were practicing baseball. Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) and four others were injured in the attack. Hodgkinson was shot and killed by police.  SAF sent Breitbart News a statement on the attack: Todays shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise ( ) and others including an aide and two Capitol Police officers is the result of Democratic hate speech toward President Donald Trump and majority Republicans, the Second Amendment Foundation said today. This hate speech that has been going on since Donald Trump was elected, said SAF founder and Executive Vice President Alan M. Gottlieb. It gets their voter base agitated and this is what happens as a result. Is this just a coincidence this happened on the presidents birthday? The gunman has been identified as James Hodgkinson of Illinois. A Facebook page belonging to the   suspect suggests that he was a socialist Democrat, and was a follower of Sen. Bernie Sanders. Sanders confirmed that Hodgkinson was apparently a volunteer in his 2016 presidential campaign. When liberal leftists support the assassination of President Trump on stage what do you expect to happen, Gottlieb stated. Hate speech and actions incite this kind of violence. It is time for Democrats like Reps. Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi, Sen. Chuck Schumer, Barrack Obama and Hillary Clinton and many of the talking heads at CNN and MSNBC to shut up.  SAF also observed: Congressman Scalise and others at the field this morning were lucky to have the protection of courageous Capitol police officers, the good guys with guns who took down a bad guy with a gun, he continued. But what if they hadnt been present? Congressman Mike Bishop of Michigan, who was at the baseball field, told a reporter, The only reason why any of us walked out of this thing, by the grace of God, one of the folks here had a weapon to fire back and give us a moment to find cover.  Maybe now the   rights Democrats will support everyones right to carry a firearm for  Gottlieb said. We are the first line of defense when it comes to personal protection from crazed individuals.

Fed Hikes Interest Rates for Fourth Time Since Financial Crisis - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Carney,6/14/2017,"The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark rate on Wednesday for the fourth time since 2008. The central bank says it is targeting a range between 1 percent and 1. 25 percent for overnight borrowing between banks. [Job gains have moderated but have been solid, on average, since the beginning of the year, and the unemployment rate has declined, the Fed said in its analysis of current economic conditions. It noted that inflation has recently declined.  The Feds expectations for future rates suggest that there will be one more hike this year, in line with what the market had been expecting. Neel Kashkari, the head of the Minneapolis Fed, dissented from the Feds decision. He would have refrained from raising rates. The Fed also announced detailed plans for how it will unwind the large balance sheet it built up by buying bonds during the financial crisis and in the years that followed. Questions over how and when the Fed would shrink its balance sheet have been foremost in the minds of investors and monetary policy mavens for some time. The Fed said it would reduce its holdings later this year by not reinvesting some of the funds received when bonds it holds mature. Currently, the Fed reinvests all of the proceeds from maturing bonds. It was the Feds third consecutive rate increase, signaling a definitive end to the Feds   old economic stimulus scheme. The move indicates the Feds confidence in the stability of the economy, although it does not necessarily indicate that the Fed is attempting to slow economic growth. Monetary policy makers believe that low rates support economic growth by lowering the cost of borrowing for businesses, homebuyers and consumers raising rates is believed to reduce central bank support for the economy. The Feds move came after several disappointing data points appeared to indicate that the economy may be softening and hoped for tax cuts may be delayed longer than expected. Job creation in May came in lower than expected, at just 138. 000 jobs. Retail sales in May fell 1. 6 percent from the prior month, the biggest decline in 16 months. Economists had expected sales to increase in May, following a 0. 4 percent increase in April. Prior to the Fed announcement on Wednesday, consumer price data revealed that inflation unexpectedly fell in May. Core CPI, an economic indicator closely watched by the Fed because it excludes volatile food and energy costs, rose 1. 7 percent   . That was lower than expected and short of the Feds announced   target. The dollar was weaker prior to the Feds announcement but following the release of the soft economic data. Yields on   Treasuries, which are thought to reflect investors expectations of the path of future   rates, fell. Falling   yields indicate that investors are lowering their expectations for future   rates. The yield on   Treasuries was down 10 basis points to 2. 11 percent earlier Wednesday."
COULTER: The Resistance Goes Live-Fire - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ann Coulter,6/14/2017,"The explosion of violence against conservatives across the country is being intentionally ginned up by Democrats, reporters, TV hosts,   comedians and celebrities, who compete with one another to come up with the most vile epithets for Trump and his supporters. [They go right up to the line, trying not to cross it, by, for example, vamping with a realistic photo of a decapitated Trump or calling the president a piece of s    while hosting a show on CNN.  The media are orchestrating a bloodless coup, but theyre perfectly content to have their   shock troops pursue a bloody coup. This week, one of the lefts foot soldiers gunned down Republican members of Congress and their staff while they were playing baseball in Virginia. Democratic Socialist James Hodgkinson was prevented from committing a mass murder only by the happenstance of a member of the Republican leadership being there, along with his   Capitol Police protection. Remember when it was frightening for the losing party not to accept the results of an election? During the third debate, Trump refused to   agree to the election results, saying hed look at it at the time.  The media responded in their usual   style: A HORRIFYING REPUDIATION OF DEMOCRACY     The Washington Post, Oct. 20, 2016, DENIAL OF DEMOCRACY     Daily News (New York) Oct. 20, 2016 DANGER TO DEMOCRACY     The Dallas Morning News, Oct. 20, 2016, ONE SCARY MOMENT IT ALL BOILED DOWN TO        DEMOCRACY     Pittsburgh   Oct. 21, 2016, (Shock) spiked down the nations spinal column last night and today when the Republican nominee threatened that this little election thing you got there, this little democratic process youve got here, its nice, its fine, but he doesnt necessarily plan on abiding by its decision when it comes to the presidency.      Rachel Maddow, Oct. 20, Trumps answer on accepting the outcome of the vote is the most disgraceful statement by a presidential candidate in 160 years.      Bret Stephens,   editorial page editor at The Wall Street Journal, I guess were all going to have to wait until Nov. 9 to find out if we still have a country     if Donald Trump is in the mood for a peaceful transfer of power. Or if hes going to wipe his fat a    with the Constitution.      CBSs Stephen Colbert, Oct. 19, 2016, Its unprecedented for a nominee of a major party to themselves signal that they would not accept     you know, respect the results of an election. Weve never had that happen before.        This really presents a potentially difficult problem for governing            MSNBCS Joy Reid, Oct. 22, 2016, This is very dangerous stuff        would seriously impair our functioning as a democracy.        This is about as serious as it gets in the United States.      CNNs Peter Beinart, Oct. 20, 2016, Obviously, its despicable for him to pretend that theres any chance that he would not accept the results of this election it would be     in 240 years youve never had anybody do it.            CNNs Van Jones, Oct. 20, 2016, Then Trump won, and these very same hysterics refused to accept the results of the election. Recently, Hillary announced her steadfast opposition to the winning candidate using a military term, saying shed joined the Resistance.  Imagine if Trump lost and then announced that hed joined the RESISTANCE.  Hed be accused of trying to activate   militias. Every dyspeptic glance at an immigrant would be reported as fascistic violence. But the media seem blithely unaware that the   Resistance has been accompanied by nonstop militaristic violence from liberals. When Trump ripped up our Constitution and jumped all over it by failing to concede the election three weeks in advance, CNN ran a segment on a single tweet from a random Trump supporter that mentioned the Second Amendment. Carol Costello: Still to come in the Newsroom, some Trump supporters say they will refuse to accept a loss on Election Day, with one offering a threat of violence. Well talk about that next.  In CNNs most fevered dreams about a violent uprising of Trump supporters, they never could have conceived of the level of actual violence being perpetrated by Americans who refuse to accept Trumps win. (See Hate Map.) It began with Trumps inauguration, when a leftist group plotted to pump a debilitating gas into one Trump inaugural ball, military families were assaulted upon leaving the Veterans Inaugural Ball, and attendees of other balls had water thrown on them. Since then, masked, armed liberals around the country have formed   organizations to beat up conservatives. In liberal towns, the police are regularly ordered to stand down to allow the assaults to proceed unimpeded. The media only declared a crisis when conservatives fought back, smashing the   beta males. (Battle for Berkeley! ) There is more media coverage for conservatives microaggressions toward powerful minorities      such as using the wrong pronoun     than there is for liberals physical attacks on conservatives, including macings, concussions, and hospitalizations. And now some nut Bernie   confirms that its Republicans standing on a baseball field, before opening fire. In the medias strategic reporting of the attempted slaughter, we were quickly told that the mass shooter was white, male and had used a gun. We were even told his name. (Because it was not Mohammed. ) But the fact that Hodgkinsons Facebook page featured a banner of Sanders and the words Democratic Socialism explained in 3 words: We the People Since 1776 apparently called for hours of meticulous   by our media. Did reporters think they could keep that information from us forever? The fake news insists that Trumps White House is in chaos.  No, the country is in chaos.

Report: Evergreen State College Faculty Donate Overwhelmingly to Democrats - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/14/2017,"The Evergreen State College faculty is as biased as one might expect, according to recently released data on the staffs political donation history. [During the 2016 presidential elections, Evergreen faculty reportedly donated an overwhelming $10, 086 to Democratic candidates and only $400 to Republican candidates. Bernie Sanders received the majority of donations from Evergreen faculty, taking in $5, 404 from the colleges faculty compared to Hillary Clintons $2, 026.  Evergreen President George Bridges made multiple donations to Democratic candidates, with $250 going to Rep. Dennis Heck in 2016, $300 to former Rep. Walt Minnick in 2008, and $500 to Sen. Patty Murray in 2014. Donation totals for the faculty werent much different during the 2008 presidential elections. Evergreen employees contributed over $16, 000 to Democratic candidates and only $200 to Republican candidates. During the 2004 election, 100 percent of faculty donations went to Democratic candidates. Perhaps most interestingly, Evergreen faculty have not donated a single dollar to a Republican congressional candidate since 2012.

Top GOP senator: The secretive process of writing the healthcare bill is like having a baby,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,6/14/2017,"Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn had a colorful way to   describe the secretive process of crafting a healthcare bill   during an interview on Monday.     Its like having a baby. Its not here yet, but its coming,        That due date comes soon. The GOP is closing in on a deal   for a bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, the law   colloquially known as Obamacare, outside of the public eye.     But before the bill debuts, a few key points of disagreements   among Republicans need to be ironed out.     In an attempt to avoid the heavy backlash and ensure   disagreements in the conference dont spill out into plain     as   was the case in the House GOPs fight over the American   Health Care Act     the Republican Senate majority is       Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other leaders have   reportedly been crafting the bill with a small group of GOP   senators. But many members, even Republicans, have no idea   what the text of the bill contains.     According to  and Laura Litvan, Republican Sens. Ron   Johnson, Bob Corker, Bill Cassidy, Lindsey Graham and Jeff Flake   .          This secretive process has infuriated Democrats, who are accusing   Republicans of hiding behind closed doors because the House   version of healthcare legislation became so unpopular with the   American public.     T             Reports have suggested a few major problems preventing   Republicans from coming together behind one bill and advancing it   to the floor for a vote.     While the bill is likely to look similar to the House AHCA on   many major aspects, several key issues will decide whether Senate   Republican leaders can get the bill passed.     Among those problems include how long to continue funding for   Obamacares Medicaid expansion. The program allowed states to   increase the threshold for Medicaid enrollees to 138% of the   federal poverty limit. Many states controlled by Republicans took   the extra funding from the federal government, so the House   bills repeal of the funding in 2020 has gotten pushback from   senators in those states.     Conservatives like Sens. Ted Cruz and Rand Paul have also come   out against a slower   of this funding, making a   compromise more difficult.     Other problems include funding for tax credits to allow people to   gain access to insurance coverage and maintaining Obamacares   essential health benefits, which mandate a minimum of health   procedures that insurance plans must cover.     With only a   majority, Republicans have little wiggle room   to have members turn against the bill.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn had a. .."
"Officials identify gunman, victims in UPS shooting",CNN,Eliott C. McLaughlin,6/14/2017,"San Francisco (CNN) The gunman who killed three men at a UPS facility in San Francisco and then killed himself has been identified as    Jimmy Lam, said a source close to the investigation. The victims were Wayne Chan, 56, and Benson Louie, 50, both of San Francisco and    Michael Lefiti of Hercules, California, the citys medical examiner said. Two others were shot but survived the Wednesday shooting at the UPS San Francisco Customer Center, police said. Officers responded to a report of an active shooter about 8:55 a. m. local time (11:55 a. m. ET) at a package sorting and delivery facility, a couple of blocks east of Franklin Square.  When officers went inside the building, they found the suspect armed with an assault pistol, Assistant Police Chief Toney Chaplin told reporters.  The suspect put the gun to his head and immediately discharged the weapon, he said. No officer fired a shot during the confrontation, Chaplin said. UPS spokesman Steve Gaut released a statement saying that six employees were involved in a shooting incident but that the company, which employs 350 people, could provide any identifications until the police investigation is complete.  The suspect was wearing a UPS uniform but investigators have not confirmed whether he was an employee. A source close to the investigation said he worked for the delivery company. Authorities didnt know if the shooter have targeted victims. On Wednesday, Chaplin said there was no indication the shooting was   but did not talk about a possible motive. Five other people were injured, likely during the evacuation, Chaplin said.  Authorities interviewed all witnesses and were talking to the victims families on Wednesday. Run, there is a shooter A woman named Michelle, who did not want to provide her last name, was walking to work across the street from a UPS facility when she saw several UPS employees running down the street. They told her to run because there had been a shooting, she told CNN, explaining she ran about a block with the workers.  I was confused. They crossed the street and when they got to me, they said, Run, there is a shooter, so I started to run with them, she said. Several of them said it was a driver they worked with who had a gun and opened fire. I feel terrible for the people hurt and for the UPS team that was there but survived. Antonio Salic told CNN he was working in a house across from the UPS building when he heard shots fired. I peeked out the window, he said. I saw people getting out (of the building) and they were wounded. A lot of people were running. The construction worker said he also saw people on the roof with their hands up, letting police know they were unarmed. Police approached and they were taken to a safe place, he said.  After the shooting, UPS said the company wasnt immediately sure of the status of the survivors who were taken to the hospital.  The company is saddened and deeply concerned about affected employees, family members and the community we share, a statement said.  Aerial footage showed police leading dozens of people, many in matching brown work uniforms, out of a building. A tactical vehicle arrived shortly thereafter.  The site of the shooting was in the Potrero Hill area, a largely residential neighborhood. The shooting was also not far from a Whole Foods market and the brewery that makes Anchor Steam beer.  Residents were warned to avoid the area because of heavy law enforcement activity."

[America has been divided, King said, according to the Washington Post. And the center of America is disappearing, and the violence is appearing in the streets, and its coming from the left.   Asked whether the shooting was politically motivated, he said he did not know why the gunman did what he did. However, King pointed at anger and demonstrations against Trump, according to the Post: King, in his remarks at the shooting scene, said it was impossible to separate the hyperpartisan climate in Washington     especially people protesting Trump     with Republican members of Congress being fired upon at a baseball practice. The divisions within the country, people that cant accept the results of the election that are determined to try to take this country down, take this organization down, he said. This city was filled up with demonstrations the day after the inauguration, where you couldnt drive down the streets. And weve had demonstrations every week since then, sometimes different topics.  King added: We do need to focus on whats happening to the culture in this country.  The shooter has been identified as James T. Hodgkinson III, 66, of Belleville, Ill. by law enforcement officials. The shooting occurred early Wednesday morning at a park where Republican congressmen and their aides were practicing for an annual baseball charity game played against Democratic colleagues. Democrats were also practicing at the time, but in D. C. An FBI official told reporters at the scene that it was too early to tell if the GOP congressmen were targeted or not. Yet, a look at a Facebook page appearing to belong to Hodgkinson showed he was a Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) supporter who bashed Trump several times and liked an   cartoon."
WaPo Report: Mueller Investigating Donald Trump for Possible Obstruction of Justice - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/14/2017,"Recently appointed Special Counsel on the Russia investigation Robert Mueller has begun the process of interviewing senior intelligence officials as part of an investigation into President Donald Trumps conduct according to a Washington Post report that cites anonymous officials. [The Post reported that according to five officials briefed on requests, those to be interviewed include: Director of National Intelligence Daniel Coats, National Security Agency head Mike Rogers and Rogers now former deputy Richard Ledgett. They said that these three have agreed to interviews with Muellers team. Those interviews could happen within days.  The Post also reported that according to people familiar with the matter the investigation into Trump began shortly after the President fired   Director James Comey. Those people also told the outlet that investigators are looking for people both inside and outside of government that can attest to the Presidents comments on why he fired Comey, the Russia investigations, and others. Comey revealed last week, in a hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee, that he had informed President Trump three times that the president was not under FBI investigation. The now former FBI Director failed to reveal that information publicly while he was still in his position. During that testimony, Comey also revealed that he had leaked a memo containing his notes from a February 14 meeting with Trump. Muellers probe is looking into any possible contact between Trump and Russian operatives and for any potentially suspicious financial dealings with those individuals according to the Post. The report adds that the officials say Mueller is interested in a March 22 conversation between Trump, Coats, and CIA Director Mike Pompeo. According to the officials that spoke with the Post, Coats told associates that the president asked about intervening with Comey in regards to the investigation into former National Security Adviser Mike Flynn. The report states Coats later told lawmakers that he never felt pressured to intervene.  A phone request from the president to each Coats and Rogers a few days later asked for public statements denying coordination between Trumps presidential campaign and the Russians, the officials told the Post. They added that Coats and Rogers refused to comply. The anonymous officials said that Ledgetts contact with Trump was uncertain, but that he wrote a memo about the call between Rogers and Trump. This news comes just after news broke that brought Muellers investigative team into question. CNN reported that three members of Muellers Russia investigation team have donated to Democrats, including Hillary Clintons campaign for President. The report cites Federal Election Commission records. CNN reported, More than half of the more than $56, 000 came from just one lawyer and more than half of it was donated before the 2016 election, but two of the lawyers gave the maximum $2, 700 donation to Hillary Clinton last year.

Trump announced the news during a statement to the press at the White House where he praised the heroism of two Capitol police officers who were shot during the attack.

The president specifically recognized House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, who was wounded in the shooting, as a patriot and a fighter.  Steve, I want you to know that you have the prayers not only of the entire city behind you, but of an entire nation and, frankly, the entire world, he said. America is praying for you.

White House throws cold water on rumors an angry Trump may fire Robert Mueller,Business Insider,Bryan Logan,6/14/2017,"President Donald Trump has no intention to fire Robert Mueller,   the former FBI director in charge of investigating Russias     meddling, the White House said Tuesday.     While the president has the right to, he has no intention to do   so, said deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders in a   press briefing aboard Air Force One on Tuesday evening.     The president is nonetheless angered by the probe, which he has   described as a witch hunt, The . The Times reported Trump has been bothered by   conservative news reports that Mueller was close to fired FBI   director James Comey.     White House staffers made a concerted effort to talk Trump down   from ordering that Mueller be fired, the paper said.     Mueller, who was appointed to oversee the investigation last   month, was roundly praised by Democrats and Republicans as the   right person for the job, but Trump was not pleased. After   Muellers appointment was announced last month, Trump floated the   idea of firing him, but staffers sought to squash the idea, which   they believed would turn a bad situation into a catastrophe,   The Times .     Trump was apparently bothered by reports from conservative   outlets like Breitbart News that attempted to link Mueller to   Comey, the FBI director Trump fired the same month.     Comey testified to the Senate Intelligence Committee last week   that he gave one of his associates, a Columbia professor,   permission to share information from memos Comey wrote about his   private conversations with Trump. Comey told senators he thought   publicizing the contents of those memos would prompt the   appointment of a special counsel in the Russia investigation.        Trump has made it clear that he is frustrated by the US probe of   Russian interference in the presidential election, which US   intelligence officials said was done to tilt the outcome in   Trumps favor. Investigators are also probing whether any Trump   campaign associates colluded with Russian officials.     Trump, according to The Times, has brought up the legal and   political implications of firing Mueller, whom he thinks is   incapable of an impartial investigation.     White House staffers have nonetheless sought to talk Trump down   from the idea.     Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein  that there was no secret plan to fire   Mueller, nor was there cause.     Mueller was already granted a waiver by the Justice Department to   lead the probe despite a possible conflict of interest stemming   from his law firms representation of some of the people caught   up in the investigation, including former Trump campaign manager   Paul Manafort and Jared Kushner, the presidents    and   senior adviser.     Despite that, Trump is stewing over the   investigation   in the same way he did with Comey.     The Times boiled down Trumps thinking:     Neither Trump nor Attorney General Jeff Sessions have offered   public support for Mueller. Sessions recused himself from Trump     investigations in February.     Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, said on Tuesday: As long as   Im in this position, hes not going to be fired without good   cause.  President Donald Trump has no intention to fire. .."
"After drama, Southern Baptists denounce the Alt-Right",CNN,Chris Moody,6/14/2017,"Phoenix, Arizona (CNN) The Southern Baptist Convention moved to denounce the   white nationalist movement Wednesday, a collective decision that occurred only after pastors pushed back against denominational leaders who initially chose not to address the issue. At their annual meeting, Southern Baptists agreed to a statement decrying every form of racism, including   white supremacy, as antithetical to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Denominational leaders had planned not to vote on a resolution about race relations, but reversed course following an outcry on the floor of the convention the day before. Leaders worked through the night to craft an updated resolution after the original text failed to gain traction on the first day of the convention. The debate began when Rev. Dwight McKissic, a black pastor from Arlington, Texas, called on Southern Baptists to formally condemn the movements retrograde ideologies, xenophobic biases, and racial bigotries and   its opposition to racism in the aftermath of a presidential election that saw the rise of a small movement of nationalist and white supremacists that coalesced in support of President Donald Trump. Members of the Southern Baptist Convention, a coalition of churches that comprise the nations largest Protestant denomination, convene just once a year to discuss church business, make budget decisions, commission new missionaries and vote on resolutions that affirm their theological, social or political priorities. A Resolutions Committee chooses what topics will be formally voted upon before the meeting. This years list of approved resolutions, for example, included a call to defund Planned Parenthood, a rebuke of gambling and an affirmation that morality is important for political leaders.  Race relations are an extremely sensitive issue within the Southern Baptist Convention. The denomination was founded in 1845, when it split from other Baptists who opposed slavery. The denomination did not formally rebuke its past until 1995, when Southern Baptists voted to repent and apologize for their history of racism, support of slavery and failure to stand firmly in opposition to white supremacy. The body did not elect its first black president of the convention until 2012 the first black president of its annual pastors conference began his term of service this year. Like the nations population as a whole, the American Church is becoming less white, a demographic shift that has led many denominations to ensure they put more emphasis on diversity in leadership and make worshippers of color feel welcome in their sanctuaries. McKissics resolution, however, had been rejected by the conventions Resolutions Committee before the meeting. It would not receive a vote unless it was forced by the will of the convention attendees    called messengers    from the floor.  On Tuesday afternoon, McKissic stood to introduce his resolution and ask why it was rejected. Barrett Duke, chairman of the Committee on Resolutions, said that it had been rejected because it was not   and included inappropriate language.  McKissic called for the body to instruct the committee to reconsider, which would require a   majority. It failed.  Few messengers had seen the actual resolution and many expressed confusions about what, exactly the   was. Still, the rejection set off alarm bells among many pastors at the convention who couldnt believe their denomination might fail to stand against new manifestations of racism and chose not to act.  After the vote on whether to consider McKissics resolution failed, Rev. Garrett Kell, the lead pastor of Del Ray Baptist Church in Virginia, who is white, approached a microphone and addressed SBC president, Rev. Steve Gaines.  This may show my ignorance, sir, because I dont know how this works, Kell said. But I would hate for us to leave here today with confusion about where the Southern Baptist convention stands on the  .  Kell was told that the messengers would need to agree to   the Resolutions Committee process, which seemed unlikely.  Meanwhile, McKissic was incensed. He walked through the crowded convention hall and demanded a meeting with the conventions Parliamentarian to find a way for the issue to be addressed.  McKissic was told that there was still a way: He could try to bring it up again at another session that night.  He did, but this time he didnt come alone. A group of mostly young,   and Millennial pastors had mobilized through social media, and vowed to help him navigate convention rules to force a vote.   Im going to make sure that this Southern Baptist Convention is not going to complete with any illusion that this entity supports in any way a racist group, especially in light of the fact that this convention was founded on racist ideologically, Kell said. Being unclear on the spirit of this is dumb, foolish and bad stewardship of time.  Charles Hedman, a pastoral assistant at Capitol Hill Baptist Church in Washington, DC, and an attorney versed in the arcane rules of parliamentary procedure, took the lead from the floor.   He called on the convention to reconsider McKissics resolution and condemn the   from the stage as we speak right now so there is not misunderstanding from the press or this convention.  Standing at another microphone across the room, Kell pressed further.   I just want clarity from the president of the Southern Baptist Convention about whether we condemn, as a convention, racism, he said.   Speaking from the stage, Gaines responded, Ill speak for myself. I dont know that I can speak for everyone in this room, but I believe God loves everyone. I believe there is only one race and that is the human race.  Another vote was taken on whether to make more time to reconsider.  They wouldnt know the results for another three hours.  Danny Akin, a denomination leader and president of the Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary, called Gaines on the phone. I think were heading toward a trainwreck,Akin warned him.  As a   plan, a group of pastors came together and vowed to work through the night to draft their own resolution condemning racism and release it on their own accord through social media. But behind the scenes, Southern Baptist leaders were already working fast.  Russell Moore, the president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission, and a leading Southern Baptist voice on the issue of racial reconciliation, took the lead to   the resolution. As an outspoken critic of Trump in 2016, Moore became a polarizing figure last year    at least temporarily    within the denomination. Trump went on to win a supermajority of support from evangelical voters, putting Moore largely out of step with his theological brethren.  But that was then. Now, the Southern Baptists needed his voice more than ever.  It was critically important to get this right Moore said. The   isnt just some sociological movement. The   is contrary to the gospel of Jesus Christ and Satanic to the core. We need to be very clear on that. Moore and members of leadership went into overdrive working backstage on a new,   resolution. After a worship service and a ceremony to commission new missionaries, Gaines and other leaders returned to the stage to announce the results of the vote three hours earlier.  This one, too, he announced, failed to reach the   needed. Messengers in the conventional hall gasped.  Gaines, however, was resolute about not leaving until the issue was addressed. Under a cloud of external pressure from media reports saying they had failed to condemn racism and a storm of criticism on social media, Gaines decided to push the boundaries of the rules.  The Resolutions Committee, he said, recognized that they had made a mistake and unanimously voted to request something of a parliamentary  . Even though they had already formally closed their annual report, they requested permission from the convention to use open time the next day to hold a vote on a newly worded resolution that would condemn the of the philosophy  . The new resolution, which risked little confusion with the new title, On the   of   White Supremacy, could be voted on the following day if   agreed to an immediate vote. Gaines took time to explain what the   was and why he and other leaders believed it should be condemned. He called the vote. A sea of hands went up throughout the convention all. Organizers said they saw only one person vote in opposition.  After the dramatic vote, pastors gathered in a nearby room to debrief, where they acknowledged that they narrowly dodged a catastrophe.  We ended up with a black eye here, said Al Mohler, president of the Southern Theological Seminary. We should never apologize for doing the right thing even if we end up a little bruised in doing it, even if we stumble over each other on the way to doing it. . ..Thanks be to God we got a chance to come back tomorrow and say what we want to say. That was so close to being a disaster."
Tensions Rise as Bill Cosby Jury Struggles to Reach Verdict,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/14/2017,"NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP)     As deliberations in Bill Cosbys sexual assault trial continue into a fourth day Thursday, nerves are frayed, patience is shot and no one is certain when it will all end. [Some jurors appeared angry, the judge sounded exasperated and accuser Andrea Constands mother broke down in tears Wednesday.  The sequestered jury has been at it for more than 27 hours since getting the case Monday, pausing a   times to revisit key evidence, including Cosbys   admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills. Judge Steven ONeill seemed vexed at times as the court staff struggled to answer the jurys requests. One batch of requested testimony hadnt even been transcribed yet. But when jurors asked to stop for the day Wednesday night, ONeill was effusive with praise     encouraging their diligence as they weigh charges that could put the    Cosby in prison for the rest of his life. This is an incredible jury that has just acted with incredible dignity and fidelity, ONeill said. I dont have any higher praise. You have taken your task so seriously.  Cosby is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Each carries a maximum   prison term, though the counts could be merged at sentencing if he is convicted. The case has already helped demolish his   reputation as Americas Dad. Cosby has wavered between stoic and smiling as he awaits his fate, but gave a brief   as jurors listened to a court reporter reread his January 2005 police interview. In it, he claimed Constand showed no ill effects from the 1   Benadryl pills he gave her to help her relax, and that she never objected to his behavior during the 2004 encounter at his suburban Philadelphia home. Constand testified last week that she was paralyzed by the pills and unable to fight Cosby off. Her mother, Gianna Constand, pulled a cloth from her pocket to wipe away tears Wednesday as she listened to the testimony. Cosbys lawyers maintain Constand was a willing sexual partner. Some jurors closed their eyes and tilted their heads down as they listened to the police interview. One slunk down in his seat, looking angry. Can you find 12 people who will agree? Thats the question, said criminal lawyer Alan J. Tauber, who wasnt involved in the case. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done."
The Nuclear Option: Sessions Schools Trump/Russia Conspiracy Theorists on Hill - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charles Hurt,6/14/2017,"No more Mr. Nice Guy. [Attorney General Jeff Sessions came out swinging Tuesday, blasting his former colleagues in the U. S. Senate for their sham investigation into these loony accusations that somehow Mr. Sessions conspired with Russians to rig last years election.  The   Mr. Sessions ripped Sen. Al Franken, current Minnesota Democrat and former comedian, for his rambling question during Mr. Sessions January confirmation hearings that sparked a feeding frenzy among Democratic dodo birds desperate to find the slenderest reed of a connection between Russia and anyone who has ever supported President Trump. With precision and accuracy Tuesday, Mr. Sessions noted how Mr. Franken had larded his question with bamboozling charges about compromising personal information the Russians had supposedly collected about Mr. Trump. The Saturday Night Live sketch actor asserted there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trump surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  Finally, Mr. Franken got down to his question: What would Mr. Sessions do     as attorney general     if evidence ever actually surfaced suggesting that the Trump campaign really had conspired with the Russian government to rig the American election. Blindsided, yet still eager to be forthcoming and truthful, Mr. Sessions simply answered that he was not aware of any such conspiracy. In his confirmation hearing, Mr. Sessions answered Mr. Frankens question truthfully and accurately. Ironically, it was every core assertion in Mr. Frankens question that has since been proven utterly false or entirely unfounded. In Tuesdays testimony, Mr. Sessions excoriated     in a voice that appeared quavering with anger at times     those who are knowingly distorting plain and simple events into this vast web of conspiracy. The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie, he said, looking sharply at the senators he worked alongside for the past two decades. He also reminded the committee that     despite the unrelenting lies by Democrats and the media     the attorney general NEVER recused himself from the   investigation because of some phantom ties he had to Russia, but rather because he was part of Mr. Trumps presidential campaign. Defiantly adding this: I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false accusations.  Mr. Sessions even went so far as to gently ridicule his former colleagues for focusing on such petty, political and trivial nonsense at a time when far more pressing matters should be occupying their full attention. Just last week, it was reported that overdose deaths in this country are rising faster than ever recorded, he said. The murder rate is up over 10 percent     the largest increase since 1968.  Yet, there they were. Democrats and Republicans, alike, united in bipartisan investigation into Russians under every bed and around every corner and a hopeless, slobbering media chasing wildly after every last unfounded accusation. In a reminder to Democrats on the committee why political neophyte Donald Trump beat their veteran candidate in last years election, Mr. Sessions pointed out that yet again Congress has abandoned the American people. The president wants to focus on the people of this country to ensure they are treated fairly and kept safe, he said. The Trump agenda is to improve the lives of the American people. I know some have other agendas but that is his agenda and it is one I share.  If only those in Congress had the political instincts or noble statesmanship of President Trump, we just might get something done around here.

Report: NBC Holding Crisis Meetings Over Megyn Kelly-Alex Jones Interview,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/14/2017,"NBC is holding crisis meetings as the network has come under intense pressure to pull anchor Megyn Kellys upcoming interview with controversial InfoWars founder and radio host Alex Jones, according to a report. [The planned interview     in which Kelly questions Jones about his previous assertion that the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary school massacre was a hoax     is scheduled to air on Sunday June 18 as part of the anchors new show, Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly.   However, NBC has faced pressure from social media users     including some relatives of the victims of the Sandy Hook attack     to cancel the interview. In the wake of the controversy, J. P Morgan Chase reportedly decided to temporarily pull its advertising from the network. Nevertheless, the network has pledged to move ahead with the interview, with NBC News Chairman Andy Lack saying the interview will be edited to provide sensitivity to the Sandy Hook victims. No one expected sponsors to pull out, but this is why they hired Megyn. They expect to lose and gain viewers and they want the buzz, one source told Page Six. Next Sunday, I sit down with conservative radio host @RealAlexJones to discuss controversies and conspiracies #SundayNight June 18 on NBC pic. twitter.      Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 11, 2017,  However, Page Six reported that the network held multiple meetings Wednesday to discuss its response to the criticism, with some employees urging the network to axe the interview. Its a sh*t show. No one wants to withstand a whole week of criticism over this. There are a number of people who want to pull the interview, an unnamed source told the outlet. In a statement posted to her Twitter account Tuesday, Kelly said: I find Alex Jones suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax as personally revolting as every other rational person does. It left me, and many other Americans, asking the very question that prompted this interview: How does Jones, who traffics in these outrageous conspiracy theories, have the respect of the president of the United States and a growing audience of millions? As a result of the controversy, Kelly has agreed to step down as host of a gun violence prevention fundraiser being held Wednesday by Sandy Hook Promise, a group that was founded after the 2012 attack. What I think were doing is journalism, she said. The bottom line is that while its not always popular, its important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. Hes been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists dont get the choice over who has power or influence in our country.    You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com"

L.A. Mayor Eric Garcetti Proposes Monorail to San Fernando Valley - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/14/2017,"Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti has proposed building a monorail along the Interstate 405 to connect the San Fernando Valley with West Los Angeles on Tuesday, relieving traffic on one of the worlds busiest and most congested roads. [Garcetti floated the idea on  s Ask the Mayor program, according to the Los Angeles Times. He reportedly said that monorails could scale the relatively steep grade of the Sepulveda Pass, which the 405 passes through, while ordinary light rail cannot manage the incline.  Currently, there are numerous bus links between the San Fernando Valley and the rest of Los Angeles. The L. A. Metro Red Line also links the valley to downtown via a station at North Hollywood. California is not short of new ideas for public transportation. Governor Jerry Brown continues to back the troubled California   Rail Authority, which intends to link Los Angeles to the San Francisco area through the Central Valley. Tesla CEO Elon Musk is developing the Hyperloop, a new technology that proposes to link the two cities along the Interstate 5 corridor using rail pods launched within a vacuum tube. However, Californians seem to prefer their cars regardless of available public transportation options. Politicians seem to prefer new rail lines over existing bus lines, which are already heavily subsidized. The Times notes that the monorail could be funded through sales tax revenues collected under Measure M, which was passed by Los Angeles County voters in November and which is intended to fund transportation projects. However, there have been no steps taken to begin the development or design of a monorail. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

12 dead in London residential tower fire,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,6/14/2017,"London (CNN) The search for survivors ended as   gathered Wednesday night near a west London   that was gutted by a massive fire. But the recovery operation continues and an investigation is just getting started into what caused the deadly blaze that left at least 12 dead and dozens more injured. All 24 floors of Grenfell Tower in North Kensington were quickly engulfed, trapping residents and reportedly forcing some to jump to escape what Londons fire chief called an unprecedented blaze. Authorities pledged to review concerns raised about fire safety in the building, including the possibility that a recent refurbishment contributed to the fires spread. British Prime Minister Theresa May promised a proper investigation as soon as recovery is completed. For now, though, she said the focus is on helping residents and emergency responders to ensure they have what they need to continue with their harrowing work. Latest developments,    At least 12 people have died and police expect the toll to rise.    78 people were hospitalized, 18 of whom are in critical care.    London Fire Brigade says it has rescued 65 people from the tower.    Residents say they were told to stay in their apartments as the fire raged.    125 families live in the building, which also houses a nursery. Witnesses described people leaping from the building and trapped children banging on windows as the fire broke out around 1 a. m. local time. At the height of the blaze, around 200 firefighters, 40 fire trucks and 20 ambulance crews were at the scene. This is going to be a long and complex recovery operation and I do anticipate that the number of fatalities will sadly increase beyond those 12, London Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy said Wednesday night. I dont anticipate there will be further survivors. It is unclear how many people are still unaccounted for. The Italian Foreign Ministry said at least two Italians are missing and British Labour politician David Lammy said artist Khadija Saye also was missing. By the afternoon, emergency centers had been set up at nearby churches and posts. Community members and organizations handed out food, clothes and other supplies to those left with no home to return to.  Some in the community suggested the Muslim holy month of Ramadan helped contain the fallout. The neighborhood is home to a large number of Muslims who were awake when the fire broke for their early morning meal before starting their daily fast. A lot of lives were saved because of that, because they were awake, said neighborhood resident Ahmed Shellat, who claimed to know people in the building. They felt the fire quickly, and they saw the heat so they just ran out. If it was like a normal day they wouldve been asleep and there would have caused a lot of casualties. As night fell Wednesday, Londoners gathered near the building to participate in a candlelight vigil and contribute to relief efforts.  After sunset an Iftar table was laid out at Rugby Portobello Trust for volunteers ending their fast. Everyone is standing together and I think that is the most important thing that has come out of this tragic event    that at least we are here standing together supporting our community members on this tragic day, said a volunteer who identified herself as Latifa. Safety concerns previously raised, Grenfell Tower is part of the sprawling Lancaster West Estate, an enclave of social housing managed privately on behalf of the London Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. While the borough is one of the most affluent in London, North Kensington is a particularly deprived district. The tower was built in the 1970s and recently subject to a $10. 9 million redevelopment, according to property firm Rydon. The building was to undergo specific improvements to fire safety and ventilation works. The web page detailing the refurbishment was unavailable for a time on Wednesday. Local councilor Robert Atkinson told CNN the renovation works had modernized kitchens and new heating systems. Safety certificates had been issued and the council had been told it had all been brought up to date, he said. Fire chiefs said it was too early to speculate on the cause of the blaze. Residents of the tower had expressed concerns over the safety of the building, specifically pointing to fire risks, according to a website run by the Grenfell Action Group. Rydon, the company that undertook a refurbishment of Grenfell Tower, says its work met all required building control, fire regulation and health and safety standards. The company that manages the building, Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, said it was focusing on helping residents while London Fire Brigade investigates the safety of the towers structure. The company that installed the cladding on the exterior of the structure is not aware of any link between the fire and the exterior cladding to the tower, their managing director said in a statement Wednesday. Cladding is a covering or coating on a structure. The company, Harley Facades Limited, said it did not manufacture the cladding, and added: The Aluminium Composite Material (ACM) panels are a commonly used product in the refurbishment industry. We will fully support and cooperate with the investigations into this fire, Managing Director Ray Bailey said.  London Mayor Sadiq Khan visited the site on Wednesday afternoon with fire officials. He said authorities would address residents concerns as questions begin to swirl on how the blaze started and ripped up the building so quickly.  He added that the British government has promised inspections of other apartment buildings with similar refurbishments. Its really important that their questions are answered. Ill be demanding answers, he told reporters. Leaping from windows, According to witness accounts, some residents were told to stay inside their apartments as the fire raged.    buildings are typically designed to contain fire outbreaks within floors, so it is often safer to stay in an apartment unaffected by a blaze. But this fire seemed to tear up the building from the outside, gutting the outer apartments and blackening most of the facade. One woman said her friend was inside for three hours and was told by police to wait and put towels down to block the doors. When no one came to help, she decided to escape on her own. Another witness said a family friend was stuck on the eighth floor with her    daughter until 5 a. m. almost four hours after the fire broke out. Turufat Yilma, who managed to escape, told CNN there was no fire alarm at all. She only learned of the fire when a neighbor called her. Several witnesses also described the horror of seeing people leap from the tower to save themselves. They literally just jumped . .. (they) must have thought, were not going to sit here and suffocate, said Samira Awil said, adding she had seen bodies of men, women and children covered in sheets outside the building. Samira Lamrani, who lives next to Grenfell Tower, told the Press Association that she watched a woman throw her baby from a window to a man on the ground.  Survivors said they felt lucky to be alive. Michael Paramasivan said he was watching TV in the building as his girlfriend and daughter slept when he smelled burning plastic. Soon he saw the smoke and chaos.  I grabbed my little girl and ran down the stairs, he said. Half of the building was ablaze by the time we got out. And it was just spreading like wildfire."

"What its really like to have anxiety, the condition The New York Times calls a shared cultural experience",Business Insider,Erin Brodwin,6/14/2017,"It started with a math test.     I was in the eighth grade, sitting at my assigned seat with a   pencil and a green sheet of paper in front of me     it was the   class final.     Suddenly, my mind went blank. The words and numbers on the page   blurred together and became meaningless. I froze with fear. My   heart raced. What was happening to me?     With all the effort I could muster, I raised a shaky hand to ask   for the bathroom pass. As soon as I got there, I started crying   uncontrollably. Between the sobs, I vomited into the toilet.     Although I didnt know it then, what happened that day would be   the beginning of a painful and confusing series of severe bouts       episodes, in psychiatric parlance     of anxiety and depression   that would land me in a handful of hospitals and treatment   centers.     Eventually, Id be prescribed antidepressants, the drugs that Im   now convinced saved my life. But the road to medication was   rocky. If it werent for a handful of truly caring doctors     and,   of course, the health insurance that made the drugs affordable       I probably would never have found them.     This is one of the reasons I find articles that belittle the   condition, like a recent New York Times story, irksome. The   article, published in the Times style section with the title    describes anxiety as a shared cultural   experience that is the result of external factors   ranging from a recent election to increased social media use.   While feelings of stress and tension may be more prevalent   today, these feelings are not tantamount to mental illness.     In reality,  may suffer from real anxiety   disorders, and studies suggest many of them have a . I certainly   did. Articles like these could make that even harder.      When my anxiety first started cropping up, my parents wanted me   to go a natural route     in other words, they wanted me to stick   to talk therapy with counselors and avoid medication.        At the time, their choice made sense. As many as  but studies   suggested as many as .     But despite weekly sessions of therapy, my panic attacks got so   bad that I couldnt sleep or go to school. I had nightmares. I   thought of every   scenario that might happen and   lived as if they were imminent. I started obsessing about   everything, from the tests I might fail, to the friends who might   abandon me, to the food that might make me fat. I contemplated   suicide. My weight dropped to 90 pounds.     Concerned, my parents took me to dozens of doctors, who tested me   for everything. When no results turned up, my mom took me to see   a psychiatrist. After two or three   sessions, I was   diagnosed as anorexic with panic and given a prescription for   Klonopin.     Klonopin is      its a benzodiazepine like   Xanax, the drug the Times article says has replaced   antidepressants like Prozac or Lexapro as Americas trendy drug   of choice.     But Klonopin didnt alleviate my symptoms; instead, I felt like   it made me numb. Because many people who suffer from anxiety       which the NIMH says is      also suffer from     mental illnesses like depression, the medication that   works best may not actually be an   drug.        One day, I refused to go to my therapy appointment. I cried and   told my mom that I was broken and there was nothing that could be   done.      So we started over. I stopped seeing the psychiatrist and began   seeing other doctors. An endocrinologist put me on my first   antidepressant     a . Lexapro belongs to a group of   antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors,   or SSRIs, which are thought to work by amplifying the activity of   the chemical serotonin in the brain.     The way wed know if the medication was working, my doctor   told me, was if I didnt notice any big changes in my feelings or   behavior. At some point (I cant say exactly when) I started to   feel like the world seemed a little less dark. It was as if Id   been seeing everything in front of me with a   heavily   vignetted filter, and someone had gently peeled it off. I didnt   want to die, and I didnt feel numb. When my doctor asked how I   was doing, all I could tell her was, I feel ok. She smiled.     Studies suggest this can happen for many people with depression   and anxiety .        Slowly but surely, I started to get better. The panic attacks   stopped, and I gained back some weight. I made friends. I started   eating real food. I excelled in school. I went to college. I   developed a support network of people I could trust and talk to.   I moved across the country. I went to graduate school. I started   a career.     I did absolutely none of it on my own.     I kept working with a therapist who was trained in cognitive   behavioral therapy, a type of psychotherapy that involves   recognizing negative thought patterns and coming up with   solutions to overcome them. I saw a psychiatrist who managed my   medication, went to yoga classes several times   each week, and stayed close to the friends and family that   had helped me through the bad times.     Research suggests that each of these parts of my recovery can   help alleviate the symptoms of depression.  with a reduction in many depressive   symptoms. So have  and .     Antidepressants were a tool that helped me find normal. They   lifted a heavy blanket of anxiety and depression that had   previously made everything seem like an impossible chore.     Had my condition been merely a sociological condition . .. that   feeds on alarmist CNN graphics and metastasizes through social   media, as the Times article suggests, I doubt medication       whether it had been Prozac or Xanax     would have had such an   impact.

Lawmakers Join to Praise Hero Capitol Police Officers,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,6/14/2017,"House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ) identified two Capitol Police officers who stopped a shooter from massacring Republican congressmen at a baseball practice in Alexandria, Virginia. [He identified them as Special Agent David Bailey and Special Agent Crystal Griner. Both were wounded, however Capitol Police Chief Matthew Verderosa said they are in good condition and their injuries are not  .  Without these two heroes, Agent Bailey and Agent Griner, many lives would have been lost, Ryan said, addressing the House. Officers Bailey and Griner were providing security for House Majority Whip Steve Scalise ( ) when shooter James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill. opened fire on the congressmen who were practicing for an annual charity baseball game on Thursday. Scalise was shagging balls at second base when the gunman opened fire, according to eyewitnesses. Scalise was shot in the hip, and dragged himself from the infield to the outfield. As a member of House leadership, he is provided with a security detail.

15 Times Celebrities Envisioned Violence Against Trump and the GOP,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum &amp Jerome Hudson,6/14/2017,"Hollywood has issued dire predictions and hysterical warnings about Donald Trump ever since the Republican businessman first announced his candidacy for the presidency in June 2015. [But the level of vitriol and violent rhetoric against   Trump has increased substantially in recent weeks, from comedian Kathy Griffins   shock beheading photograph to Shakespeare in the Parks     assassination of Trump on a stage in New York Citys Central Park.  Unfortunately, Griffin and the director of Julius Caesar are not anomalies in Hollywood actors, writers, directors, and other celebrities have fantasized about using violence against Trump, his supporters, and other GOP lawmakers for at least the past 18 months. Below are 15 examples of celebrities who have used pointed, violent rhetoric to attack the president and other Republicans.   1. Kathy Griffin Beheads Trump in Graphic Photo, The    My Life on the   star sparked a firestorm (and a U. S. Secret Service investigation) when she was photographed holding the fake, bloodied, decapitated head of the president in an image that critics said was reminiscent of Islamic State propaganda. Griffin was fired from her job on CNNs New Years Eve broadcasts and saw the cancellation of at least five of her scheduled performances, but remained defiant in an emotional press conference, blaming the backlash on sexism and vowing to continue to make fun of the president. 2. Madonna     Ive thought a lot about blowing up the White House.  The pop singer became heated during the   Womens March on Washington in January, where she addressed an audience of thousands. Yes, Im angry. Yes, Im outraged. Yes, I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House, but I know that this wont change anything, she told the crowd to roaring applause. Are you ready to shake up the world? Madonna asked. Welcome to the revolution of love, to the rebellion, to our refusal as women to accept this new age of tyranny, where not just women are in danger but all regionalized people. Where being uniquely different, right now, might truly be considered a crime.  The singer later said her remarks were taken out of context. 3. Snoop Dogg Shoots Trump in the Head in Music Video, The California rapper pointed a gun at the president (dressed to look like a circus clown) and pulled the trigger in a music video for his song Lavender earlier this year     though the gun is shown to be a prop gun, with a Bang! flag popping out of the barrel. Still, the imagery was unmistakable. I feel like its a lot of people making cool records, having fun, partying, but nobodys dealing with the real issue with this f*cking clown as president, and the sh*t that we dealing with out here, so I wanted to take time out to push pause on a party record and make one of these records for the time being, the rapper told Billboard. 4. Robert De Niro: Id Like to Punch Him in the Face The   actor participated in a voter registration PSA during the 2016 presidential race, but was filmed going off on Trump in a monologue during an outtake. Hes a punk, hes a dog, hes a pig, hes a con, hes a bullsh*t artist, a mutt who doesnt know what hes talking about, doesnt do his homework, doesnt care, thinks hes gaming society, doesnt pay his taxes, the    Godfather star said in the clip. Hes an embarrassment to this country, he added. He talks [about] how he wants to punch people in the face       Id like to punch him in the face.  5. Joss Whedon: I Want a Rhino to F*ck Paul Ryan to Death The    Avengers director     who released a   PSA in support of Hillary Clinton during the 2016 race     took to Twitter in January to wish an untimely and unfortunate end to House Speaker Paul Ryan ( ). Violence solves nothing. I want a rhino to f*ck @SpeakerRyan to death with its horn because its FUNNY, not because hes a #GOPmurderbro, Whedon tweeted. Shortly after the November 8 election, the director tweeted that Trump CANNOT be allowed a term in office.  6. Shakespeare in the Park Stabs Trump to Death in Performance of Julius Caesar New York Citys Public Theater staged a production of Julius Caesar during its 2017 summer program, but with a twist on the classic play     Caesar looked just like Donald Trump, with a business suit and tie and a familiar blond  . As happens in the play, the   Caesar is eventually brutally stabbed to death by his associates in the Senate. The characters similarity to Trump sparked outrage, and sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines pulled their funding from the theater. The theater stood by the production. 7. David Simon: Pick Up a G*ddamn Brick if Trump Fires Robert Mueller, The creator of the HBO crime drama The Wire reacted to rumors that the president had considered firing the special counsel appointed to oversee the Russia investigation, Robert Mueller, by suggesting that Americans pick up a goddamn brick if the president followed through. If Donald Trump fires Robert Mueller and is allowed to do so, pick up a goddamn brick. Thats all thats left to you, Simon tweeted June 12. The   later denied his tweet was an incitement to violence. 8. Mickey Rourke Threatens to Beat Trump with Baseball Bat: He Can Suck My F*cking D*ck The Wrestler actor went on a   tirade against Trump in April 2016, when he had not yet won the Republican nomination for president. Donald Trump can go f*ck himself, Rourke told TMZ. His wife said, Oh, hes a tough guy. Hes not a tough guy, hes a bully and a b*tch and he can suck my f*cking d*ck. Ill meet him in a hotel room any motherf*cking day of the week and give him a Louisville slugger. Kiss my motherf*cking ass you b*tch punk c***sucker.  9. Actress Lea DeLaria Threatens to Take Out Republicans and Independents with Baseball Bat after Trump Win, Just a couple days after the November election, the Orange is the New Black star responded to a meme about dealing with violence through music by adding her own suggestion. [O]r pick up a baseball bat and take out every f*cking republican and independent I see, DeLaria wrote, adding the hashtags #f*cktrump, #f*cktheGOP, #f*ckstraightwhiteamerica and #f*ckyourprivilege.  Some of the cast of the hit Netflix show had previously appeared in a campaign ad for Hillary Clinton. 10. Rapper YG Threatens Trump with F*ck Donald Trump Song, Rappers YG and Nipsy Hussle released a song during the 2016 presidential campaign called F*ck Donald Trump, with lyrics that contained several threats toward the  . I like white folks, but I dont like   the n*ggas in the hood wanna fight   El Chapo aint tried to snipe   the Nation of Islam aint tried to find   a rally out in L. A. we gon f*ck it up, YG raps in the song. You vote Trump then youre prolly on   if your ass do win, you gon prolly get smoked, adds Hussle. YG later complained that his record label had been contacted by the Secret Service. 11. Marilyn Manson Kills Trump in Music Video, In a music video for his song Say10 released right around Election Day, the shock rocker stands over the lifeless body of a man resembling Donald Trump while ripping pages out of a Bible. In a flash, a man wearing a suit and a red tie     a    allusion to Trump     is seen decapitated on the ground in a pool of blood. Its about the desperate acts of people who believe something that is preached by an unbeliever, Manson told the Daily Beast of the explicit visuals in the video. 12. Rapper Everlast Warns Trump: I Will Punch You in Your F*cking Face The rapper and former House of Pain frontman went off on Trump in an interview with Billboard in April 2016. F*ck that dude. Ill smack that f*ckers   right off his f*cking scalp, he said. Like, for real, if I met Donald Trump, Id punch him in his f*cking face. And thats not a joke. Even if he did become president     watch out, Donald Trump, because I will punch you in your f*cking face if I ever meet you. Secret Service had better just f*cking be on it. Dont let me anywhere within a block. This is horrible.  13. Larry Wilmore Jokes About Suffocating Trump with Pillow They Used to Kill Scalia Former   host and Daily Show contributor Larry Wilmore joked about suffocating Trump during a segment on his Comedy Central show The Nightly Show. Anyway, since were talking about bigotry, we have to mention Donald Trump, Wilmore said. Sorry everyone, I dont wont to give him any more oxygen. Thats not a euphemism by the way I mean it literally. Somebody get me the pillow they used to kill Scalia, and Ill do it. Ill do it! Wilmore then proceeded to demonstrate what suffocating Trump to death might look like, before adding: I could get in trouble for that, actually! 14. Stephen Colberts Late Show Puts Stephen Millers Head on a Spike, In February, Colberts Late Show on CBS featured a segment that depicted Trump aide Stephen Miller being attacked in different scenes from cable TV shows. The segment included Miller being beaten by The Walking Deads Negan and his spiked bat, and ended with the Trump aides head superimposed onto a spike in a parody of HBOs Game of Thrones. Colbert has upped his   rhetoric since January, and it has done wonders for his ratings. The   host came under fire in May when he said during his show that Trumps mouth is only good for being Vladimir Putins c*ck holster.  15. Sarah Silverman Suggests Military Could Help Overthrow Trump, In a tweet in February, the comedian and vocal leftist activist suggested the U. S. military could join the   resistance and help overthrow the president. WAKE UP  JOIN THE RESISTANCE. ONCE THE MILITARY IS W US FASCISTS GET OVERTHROWN. MAD KING  HIS HANDLERS GO BYE BYE, Silverman tweeted. Silverman, who was one of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders earliest celebrity supporters, previously compared Trumps victory to the Great Depression.

Traders are loading up on bets against Apple,Business Insider,Joe Ciolli,6/14/2017,"Historically viewed as one of the crown jewels of the stock market,  is adjusting to its new role as a lightning rod for bearish tech speculators. Short interest on Apple has climbed by $1. 3 billion since May 15, while an   fund tracking the tech sector has actually seen short interest fall by $316 million, according to data compiled by financial analytics firm . Apple is now the third   company in the world, trailing only  and Alibaba. The past two days have been particularly fruitful for Apple pessimists, with shorts making more than $500 million in    profit amid a 6. 2% stock decline. The company came under pressure on Friday following a report from Bloomberg that the coming iPhone 8 .  While Apples decline played a large role in  the fact that investors are building bearish positions on the company while reducing bets against the broader tech sector shows that theyre getting increasingly worried about   fundamental issues. Apples increase in short interest is not a case of the tech tide lifting all boats,   Considering Apples outperformance relative to the tech sector, its not entirely surprising that its a favorite target of speculative bears. Through last Thursday, the companys stock had surged 34% in 2017, compared to a 8. 7% increase for the S&P 500. Still, compared to the other stocks in the      consisting of Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google, the iPhone maker is attracting more skepticism. Short interest in the four companies has climbed just 5% since May 15, compared to a 17% increase for Apple, S3 data show. Tech short sellers look to be targeting Apple as the near term underperformer in the sector, Dusaniwsky said. It will be interesting to see if this is a longer term trade with short interest remaining at or above the $9 billion level or if we will see an avalanche of buy to covers to realize short term profits if Apples stock price rebounds after this short term price slump.

Hillary Clinton Compares Herself to Wonder Woman,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/14/2017,"Hillary Clinton compared herself to DC Comics superhero Wonder Woman Tuesday in a video message, which aired at the Women in Film Los Angeles Crystal + Lucy Awards in Beverly Hills. [Clinton began by thanking Women in Film for its commitment to lifting up women directors, producers, writers, composers and executives.  Then the former Democratic presidential nominee suggested that she and Wonder Woman were both on a quest to save the world.   Now I havent seen Wonder Woman yet, but Im going to, in part because its directed by the fabulous Patty Jenkins, Clinton said in the video. But something tells me that a movie about a strong, powerful woman fighting to save the world from a massive international disaster is right up my alley.  Clintons taped video remarks were meant to honor actress Elizabeth Banks, who ripped President Donald Trump and stumped for Clinton last year at the Democratic National Convention. She is such a special person, again, on screen and off, Clinton said of her friend Banks. Youre not only a creative force in front of the camera and behind it, you are a passionate advocate for womens equality and opportunity I can vouch for that.

Obama White House Repeatedly Tried to Link Steve Scalise to Infamous KKK Leader David Duke - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/14/2017,"Former President Obamas political team repeatedly attacked House Republican Whip Steve Scalise as proof that the Republican party was racist, making him a target for leftist hate during their time in office. [Youll recall that one Republican congressman told a reporter that he was David Duke without the baggage, former White House press secretary Josh Earnest told reporters in September 2015, using Scalise to attack Donald Trump. Mr. Trump isnt the first Republican politician to countenance these kinds of views in order to win votes.   Scalise reportedly made the comment about Duke nearly 20 years ago, which a reporter remembered and published in January 2015. In 2002, Scalise gave a speech the   Unity and Rights Organization (EURO)     a group tied to Duke, a former KKK leader. Scalise apologized for the decision, calling it a  mistake I regret, after it became public in 2014. But the White House used Scalise as a punching bag, frequently reminding reporters that Republicans blocked both immigration reform and the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and supported allowing the Confederate flag to be placed in military cemeteries, suggesting they were racist. Those are the priorities of todays Republican Party, and theyll continue to be until someone in the Republican Party decides to summon the courage to stand up and change it, Earnest said.  The White House was still using the talking point in August 2016 ahead of the presidential election. I think what is clear is that there has been a willingness on the part of Republicans in Congress to appeal to extremists in this country to try to build political support for their party, Earnest said in August 2016, again citing the David Duke attack against Scalise. Theyve threatened to hold up government funding to make sure that the Confederate flag can be shown in government cemeteries, Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz said, repeating the David Duke comment in September 2016. In response to questions about Trump, Earnest employed the Scalise attack in June 2016. Im not surprised that there are many Republicans, in Congress at least, who have chosen to overlook these controversial comments and continue to support the presumptive Republican nominee, Earnest said, citing the David Duke comment yet again. The attacks led leftists to repeatedly suggest that Scalise was aligned with the beliefs of the KKK, a topic that was featured in political cartoons. On Facebook, the Congressional baseball practice shooter, James T. Hodgkinson, liked a political cartoon that featured Scalise as a member of the KKK.   cartoon liked by James T.

Exclusive  Sarah Palin: Hopefully Media Have Learned to Not Play Knee-Jerk Blame Game with Shooters Motives - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,6/14/2017,"Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was wrongly and inaccurately blamed when Rep. Gabby Giffords ( ) was shot several years ago, is standing up for Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont saying he is personally not responsible for the actions of his apparent supporter. [Palin, in an exclusive statement to Breitbart News, called for the media industry to be more careful than they were back when Giffords was shot   specifically asking for media integrity when it comes to learning the motives of the shooter of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise at the GOP congressional baseball practice on Wednesday morning.  Prayers for healing are raised for all victims of todays horrific violence, while we with lift up thankfulness that lives were not lost, Palin told Breitbart News. While justice is now sought upon the capture of the deranged attacker, an additional prayer must be for no acceptance of a rush to destroy anyone else in this horrible incident. Those seeking political advantage reacted so recklessly and irresponsibly the last time a member of Congress was brutally attacked, as media inexplicably played a   blame game assuming that attackers motives. Todays shooter appears to be a Bernie Sanders supporter and campaign volunteer. But Bernie Sanders is not to blame. Maybe the media have matured enough to allow coverage of this most recent violence to focus on facts, because media integrity will be crucial as America witnesses todays events unfolding and, on behalf of our Congressional Representatives, we all seek justice.  Palins call for unity, and media responsibility   and her statement standing up for Sanders despite the shooter being a Sanders supporter   comes after she has been the target of vitriolic media rhetoric for years. Perhaps the worst example of the media targeting Palin was in the wake of the shooting of Giffords, where Palin was blamed inaccurately. Republicans and Democrats in Washington are calling for unity in the wake of this latest shooting, and for an end to the leftist and media driven vitriol in the national debate. While there are some initial signs of unity   from President Donald Trumps reaction to House Speaker Paul Ryans and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosis to even Sanders statement and now this statement from Palin   it remains to be seen how long this will last. American leaders on both sides of the aisle   Republican and Democrat   tell Breitbart News they hope that moving forward Americans of all political stripes can work together."
The Changeup: Liberals Now Saying ESPNs Liberal Bias is a Good Thing,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/14/2017,"For most of the last year, ESPN in particular and the liberal sports media in general have jumped through hoops to deny that the cable sports network has a liberal bias problem. But now that the obvious has grown too hard to deny, their tactics are changing. Now, all of a sudden, ESPNs liberal bias is a good thing. [Until now, ESPN and its hosts have repeatedly denied that it has a liberal bias problem. Last year ESPN ombudsman Jim Brady published an investigation into the claim of liberal bias that ran thousands of words only to reach the conclusion that there was no liberal bias.  But that wasnt all the question so vexed the network that it hired a polling firm to find out if there is any liberal bias and, if so, has it hurt the networks ratings. Unsurprisingly, the survey bought and paid for by ESPN miraculously showed that there was no liberal bias at the network. ESPNs survey, though, flies in the face of three other surveys that did find that the network has a liberal bias problem and that the constant   content is driving viewers away. Many liberal members of the sports media, such as Awful Announcings Andrew Bucholtz, joined ESPN to   any notion that the network has a liberal bias problem. But there seems to be a changeup in the discussion as at least one liberal sportsman is now saying ESPNs dive into liberalism is a good thing for the network that is losing 10, 000 subscribers a month. According to Ty Duffy of Awful Announcing, ESPNs liberal bias is a good thing because it will bring in young, liberal fans. There is truth in the liberal claim. ESPN has tilted leftward under John Skipper, Duffy initially observed. Despite that admission, Duffy goes on to claim there is no proof that conservative fans have abandoned ESPN over its constant   content. Naturally Duffy ignored the three surveys that serve as proof of conservative discontent and relied only on ESPNs bought and paid for survey to prove his contention. But even as he offers no statistical proof to buttress his own claim, Duffy insists that ESPNs drive leftward is a shrewd move because it will bring young, woke viewers to replace the fleeing conservative audience. Major brands, such as ESPN, are now expected to exhibit a political and social consciousness. They pay a cost when they are tone deaf. If there are now two Americas, ESPN (and sports leagues) will move with the one advertisers want to reach: young people, people with disposable income, and growing minority populations. Of course, Duffy indulges gross generalizations. Only far   liberals expect major brands to exhibit a political and social consciousness.  Even if that is the case, he also seems to simply assume that even liberals dont want a place to escape politics and instead want politics to invade and conquer the sports world. Time will tell, of course, but it is interesting to see how this argument is morphing from staunch proclamations that ESPN isnt liberal to the admission that, yes, some hosts are liberal, and finally to the obdurate notion that yeah, were liberal.

Sessions: I dont recall raising concerns about Russias election interference with Ambassador Kislyak,Business Insider,Natasha Bertrand,6/14/2017,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the Senate Intelligence   Committee on Tuesday that he couldnt recall ever raising   concerns about Russias interference in the 2016 election in the   meetings he had with Russias ambassador to the US Sergey   Kislyak last year.     Sessions has said that those meetings were in his capacity as a   member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. But he demurred   when Republican Sen. John McCain if he had ever raised   concerns with Kislyak about Russias interference in our   electoral process.

Sessions, who said earlier appeared confused, choosing instead to   respond to McCains earlier question about whether he ever   discussed   security issues with Kislyak.        And his response was? McCain asked.     I dont recall, Sessions said.        It was still unclear by the end of the nearly   hearing   why Sessions met with Kislyak privately if not   to address reports that Russia was engaged in a   hacking campaign to undermine Democrats and, specifically, the   partys presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton.     Sessions lack of interest in the Russian meddling seems to have   mirrored        Former FBI Director James Comey, in a   moment   during his Senate Intelligence Committee testimony last week,   said Trump never once asked him about Russias interference in   the US election as it related to national security during their   nine conversations before he fired Comey in early May.     Did the president, in any of those interactions that youve   shared with us today, ask you what you should be doing, or what   our government should be doing, or the intelligence community, to   protect America against Russian interference in our election   system? Democratic Sen. Martin Heinrich asked Comey.     I dont recall a conversation like that, Comey said.     Heinrich pressed: Never?     No, Comey said. Not with President Trump. I attended a fair   number of meetings on that with President Obama.     Comey later said he didnt recall ever having a conversation with   Trump that suggested the president was taking the Russia threat   seriously.     I dont remember any conversations with him at all about that,   Comey said.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions told the Senate. .."
Democratic Leaders Nervous About Overreach as Members Push for Trump Impeachment,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/14/2017,"As some Democrats push harder for the impeachment of President Trump, with some threatening to bring it to the House floor, Democratic leaders are pushing back     apparently concerned about the risk of overreaching. [Rep. Brad Sherman ( ) and other members of the Democratic caucus have been pushing for a vote on impeachment     the natural consequence of months of   claims about Trumps actions in relation to alleged Russian interference in the election. Politico reported earlier this week that Sherman is prepared to buck his leadership in bringing a vote to the House floor.  Sherman claims that Trumps alleged request for former FBI Director James Comey to drop the investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn amounts to an obstruction of justice and is, therefore, an impeachable offense. His motion would almost certainly be    in the House. But Sherman isnt the only Democratic lawmaker to float impeachment. Fellow California Rep. Maxine Waters was seen chanting Impeach 45 on Sunday. Earlier this month, Rep. Al Green ( ) also called for impeachment and wants there to be a vote in the House. Obstruction of justice by the president is the problem, Green said. Impeachment by Congress is the solution.  Yet, while impeachment is always a popular word among Democrats   base whenever a Republican is in the White House, Democratic leaders are concerned about something Republicans are frequently accused of when the tables are turned     overreaching. According to the Hill, leaders are worried that an aggressive push for impeachment will further politicize the investigation and undercut both the probe and Democrats midterm election chances. Famously, Republicans were stung in the late nineties by accusations of overreach when they sought the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. Rep. Steny Hoyer ( ) the minority whip, said that talk of impeachment was not timely, according to the Hill. Meanwhile, Former Democratic National Committee Chair Donna Brazile was forced to deny Sunday that Democrats were overreaching. First of all, I dont think the Democrats are overreaching. I mean this is about the integrity of our democracy     democratic process. Its about what happened in 2016, she said on ABCs This Week. Axios reported that Democratic leadership wants to be careful using the   as the investigations havent revealed enough yet     a possible sign that Democrats were disappointed with Comeys testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee last week and that it revealed no apparent obstruction of justice. Other Democrats believe that the way to political victory is by focusing on the issues likely to decide the midterm race and the issues they were beaten on in 2016     such as jobs and health care reform. We need to be looking at the issues that matter to families at home, and that starts with jobs, health care, addressing the opioid crisis, Rep. Katherine Clark ( ) said earlier this month. We can file articles of impeachment, we very well may have a basis, but Republicans have shown theyre unwilling to criticize, to hold this president accountable, Clark said, according to the Boston Globe. Lets mobilize, get to the streets, register voters, and change the majority in the House.  Other lawmakers though, while cautious for now, are still licking their lips at the chance of impeachment     even egging Trump on to do something to trigger such a push. You want a   car to impeachment? Fire Mueller, Rep. Luis Gutirrez ( ) according to the Hill. I dare you to do it.  Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

"Southern Poverty Law Center Admits Shooter Liked Its Facebook Page, Doesnt Retract Repeated Attacks on Rep. Scalise",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/14/2017,"As details about the man who shot GOP lawmakers and staff as they practiced for a charity baseball game emerge, the Southern Poverty Law Center     which continually attacks conservatives and conservative organizations as being hate groups     issued a statement about the shooter having liked its Facebook page. [But it did not retract any of the criticism of Majority Whip Steve Scales ( ) who remains in critical condition at a local hospital.  James T. Hodgkinson, 66, of Belleville, Ill. who shot Scalise and four others, died of his wounds after first responders successfully stopped his rampage. The attack on members of Congress and their staffs today was a sickening and cowardly act of terror that must be condemned by everyone across the political spectrum, Richard Cohen, president of SPLC said in a statement. Any violent attack on our political leadership is an attack on our democracy.  Were aware that the SPLC was among hundreds of groups that the man identified as the shooter liked on Facebook, the statement said. I want to be as clear as I can possibly be: The SPLC condemns all forms of violence.  We have worked for decades to combat domestic terrorism and violence based on hate, Cohen said in the statement, entitled Attack on GOP Congressmen is Assault on Democracy.  Our hearts are with those who were injured today and the families of all who have been affected by this deplorable act, Cohen said. We hope and pray for their full recovery.  But in posts on its website dating back to 2014, SPLC had repeatedly implied that Scalise associated with white supremacists and other groups the organization had deemed hate groups, including the Family Research Center where a gunman attacked the conservative, Christian groups headquarters in Washington, D. C. in 2012 and later told law enforcement that he was inspired by SPLCs Hate Map. In its Spring Intelligence Report in 2015, SPLC implied that because Scalise lives in the same state as Ku Klux Klan members, he associated with them. In fact, Scalise, who hails from the same Louisiana parish as Duke and Knight, may have had some real affinities with EURO. In 1999, Roll Call reported that Scalise said he embraces many of the same conservative views as Duke, but is more viable. Scalise also reportedly told a columnist that his politics were similar to Dukes, but without the baggage.  In December of 2014, SPLC attacked Scalise for allegedly speaking at a gathering that included white supremacists. Faced with an exploding crisis sparked by the revelation that the No. 3 Republican in the House gave a speech to a   group of white supremacists and   a dozen years ago, the GOP in Rep. Steve Scalises home state of Louisiana is doubling down, calling the entire episode a mere manufactured blogger story, SPLC wrote. Really? A manufactured blogger story? SPLC wrote, adding: Scalise claimed yesterday that he had no idea of the views promoted by the   Unity and Rights Organization (EURO) whose workshop he addressed in 2002 at a hotel in Metairie, La. And he was backed by an array of Louisiana Republicans including state GOP chair Roger Villere Jr. who described Scalise as a man of great integrity who embodies his Christian faith in his life. Villere dismissed the story broken by Louisiana blogger Lamar White Jr. as an attempt to score political points by slandering the character of a good man. But Scalises claim of ignorance is almost impossible to believe, SPLC wrote. He was a state representative and an aspiring national politician at the time, and   EURO already was well known as a hate group led by Americas most famous white supremacist."
"Pelosi on Shooting: On Days Like Today, There are no Democrats or Republicans - Breitbart",Breitbart,Assemblyman Tim Donnelly,6/14/2017,"As Californians woke up to the news of the shooting attack on Republican members of Congress in Alexandria, Virginia, reactions were already pouring in from many of Californias top elected officials. [Top Democrats who have been the most vociferous critics of President Donald Trump and his policies abandoned their fiery resistance rhetoric and expressed uniform outrage at the shooting and sympathy for the victims.  As of 8:30AM PDT, neither Californias Governor Jerry Brown (nor Assembly Speaker Rendon ( ) had posted an official comment on their Facebook or Twitter accounts, but the responses from the rest of Californias top political leaders were virtually indistinguishable by party: Rep. David Valadao ( ) who reportedly skipped the Republican Congressional baseball practice session in preparation for Thursdays game, focused his comments solely on his wounded colleague, Rep. Steve Scalise: Praying for @SteveScalise and staff injured in this mornings tragic incident. Thankful for our brave @CapitolPolice.

Senator Kamala Harris ( ) echoed Feinsteins sentiments: Horrific. Praying for Steve Scalise, congressional staffers  Capitol Police who were shot in Virginia.  Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy ( ) of Bakersfield first tweeted his prayers:  Judy and I are praying deeply for our friend Steve, the members of Capitol Police, and staff who were wounded.  He then announced housekeeping measures:  Given todays events, no votes are expected in the House today.  Democrat Ted Lieu of Los Angeles offered prayers for the victims and condemned the shooting as senseless.  State Senate Leader Pro Tem Kevin DeLen (  Angeles) offered his thoughts and prayers as well, then finished his tweet on an edgier note, with what could be interpreted as a call for more gun control:  Gun Violence has no place in America.  But it was Democrat Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) whose Twitter comment accompanying her official statement set the tone for the California delegation:  On days like today, there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans united in our thoughts for the wounded.  She also stated: This morning, the U. S. Congress suffered a despicable and cowardly attack.  My thoughts and prayers are with Whip Steve Scalise and the others wounded, Capitol Police and staff, and their families.

"Nearly 55K Illegal Aliens Given Protection under Trump, Says Fed Report",Breitbart,John Binder,6/14/2017,"Almost 55, 000 illegal aliens were granted de facto amnesty under the Temporary Protected Status classification by President Trumps Department of Homeland Security in the first three months of 2017. [In total, 54, 944 illegal aliens either had their Temporary Protected Status (TPS) renewed by the administration or are new recipients of the classification, which has been derided by immigration hawks for being an indirect amnesty program.  Under Temporary Protected Status, hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens are allowed to remain in the U. S. for up to 18 months, as Breitbart Texas reported. After their protected status has expired, they can   to have the classification renewed. Although the number of illegal aliens receiving protected status remains high, the Trump Administration did lower the number, which encompasses January through March 2017, from where the Obama Administration had left it. In Obamas last full three months in office, DHS approved close to 84, 000 illegal aliens for temporary protected status. But while Trumps DHS does not look to be considerably destabilizing the program, Rep. Mo Brooks ( ) introduced legislation to halt the Temporary Protected Status system. My bill, the TPS Reform Act, would ensure that temporary means temporary by establishing clear time limitations and creating statutory tests that must be met to grant the TPS designation, Brooks said in an interview about the program. This legislation provides the needed reform for what has become a   amnesty program.  Days ago, Breitbart Texas reported how border crossings along the U. S.  Border increased by 31 percent in May from the previous month. John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart Texas. Follow him on Twitter at @JxhnBinder."

[College Spokesperson Zach Powers told the Olympian on Tuesday that Bret Weinstein returned to his campus classroom just over a week ago, despite Weinsteins Monday appearance on Tucker Carlsons Fox News program, during which he claimed that he was forced to relocate his family and class sessions away from campus due to safety concerns.  The college has never acknowledged the danger that they put us in, and therefore I have no way of knowing whether its safe for me to return, Weinstein said on Carlsons program. Their assurances that it is safe dont mean anything, not that theyve offered them.  I understand faculty member Bret Weinstein returned to campus just over a week ago to teach in his normally assigned classroom, Evergreen Spokesperson Zach Powers claimed. He has been notified by Evergreen Police Services of additional law enforcement present on campus. Weinstein quickly swatted down the Powers claim that he had returned to campus. If college administrators say I was on campus last week, they are lying, Weinstein told the Olympian. I left campus when it was evacuated on the morning of June 1. I held my afternoon class in a downtown park that day, and left the state with my family that evening. We have not been in Washington since, and some administrators know that.

New Poll: Tie in Georgias Sixth Congressional District Special Election Despite $23 Million Raised by Democrat,Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,6/14/2017,"A new poll charting the battle to replace Rep. Tom Price in Georgias Sixth Congressional District special election that will be held on June 20 shows the race between Jon Ossoff, the Democrat, and Karen Handel, the Republican, is tied. This is despite the $23 million that Ossoff has raised for his campaign, the vast majority of which has come from   :[Ossoff, a Democrat, and Handel, a Republican, are tied at 47% with 6% of voters undecided, in metro Atlantas 6th congressional district race, a contest that has become a virtual   for both parties on June 20. The findings underscore the fact that this race really comes down to turnout, said Emory political scientist Andra Gillespie. Both campaigns need to get as many volunteers on the phones and out in neighborhoods reminding voters to turn out on Tuesday. The campaign that has the best organized     operation will be the one who likely wins this race.  The 11Alive poll of 700 registered voters in the district was conducted by Survey USA between June 7 and June 11, 503 of whom were identified by SurveyUSA to have already voted in the runoff or to be certain to do so before the June 20 deadline.   The poll was disappointing news for Ossoff, as 11Alive. com reported: Three weeks ago, an   poll had Ossoff 7 points ahead of Handel. This latest poll includes fewer   educated and fewer   respondents than did the previous survey. In what is now the most expensive Congressional race in American history, the most current Federal Election Commission records show that as of May 31, Ossoff has raised $23 million for his campaign, while his Republican opponent, former Georgia Secretary of State Handel, has raised only $4. 5 million. As Breitbart News reported last week, the special election was once described as a bellwether test of the Trump administrations policies, but has now turned into a   budget buster whose outcome may tell us more about each partys ability to mobilize its base nationally than actual voter sentiment about the president.  With one week to go until the election, that assessment appears to continue to hold true."

Ramadan Rage: Muslim Who Ran Down Five Men with His Van Praised as Good Family Man by Judge,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,6/14/2017,"A judge at Leicester Crown Court praised a van driver who deliberately mounted a pavement and ran down five men during Ramadan as a good family man who was behaving completely out of character. [According to a report in the Daily Mirror newspaper,    Lugman Aslam, of Warren View, Leicester, had gotten into a physical altercation with the men after backing his van into one of them, during which he alleged he was racially abused.  Recorder (circuit judge) Justin Wigoder described how, following this incident, a vengeful Aslam returned to his van, mounted the pavement and ploughed through the group, in order to get [his] own back. Ive seen it on CCTV and you deliberately mounted the pavement and drove straight at them and right through the middle of them at speed, Wigoder said. Some were thrown to the side and three were struck by your vehicle   with one going over the bonnet and hitting the windscreen. Its quite remarkable that nobody was seriously hurt or killed and the only injuries complained of were bruises and scratches. One indication of the force of the collision was your windscreen was smashed     you claimed it had been hit by an animal when you got it repaired. You accept your intention, driving at them, was to cause serious injury and thats what makes this case so serious. The motivation was driving at them to get your revenge, to get your own back from the fact theyd assaulted you.  However, the judge then went on to say that he accepted the potentially deadly attack was completely out of character for the perpetrator, whom he praised as a good family man with glowing references. Youre of very positive good previous character and Ive received a considerable number of references setting out all the good that is in you, he said. Nadeem Aullybocus, defending, explained that Aslam was fasting [for Ramadan] on that day and had been doing so for about 20 days when he carried out the attack. He pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and attempting to inflict intentional grievous bodily harm, and ultimately received a   sentence and a     year driving ban. With the automatic parole provisions in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, it is unlikely he will serve more than half of his prison term in custody. The relatively light sentence follows a number of deadly   attacks on pedestrians in Britain and Europe, including the Westminster Bridge attack on March 22nd and the London Bridge attack on June 3rd."

Man freed after lookalike becomes suspect,CNN,Carma Hassan,6/14/2017,"(CNN) What if you landed in prison for 17 years for a crime someone who looked just like you was suspected of committing?  Thats what happened to Richard Jones in 1999. But Jones was released from prison June 8 after a team from the Project for Innocence at the University of Kansas found his doppelganger. His lawyers say in 1999, a man named Rick was picked up at a home by a trio of crack smokers looking for drugs in Kansas City, Kansas. Rick told the group he could help them get more drugs, but hed need money first.  So the group drove to a nearby Walmart and Rick tried to steal a womans purse. The woman fought back and held onto the purse, but Rick made off with her cellphone. Because the woman fell and scraped her knees, the phone theft was classified as an aggravated robbery.    A suggestive lineup,   A witness wrote down the license plate number of the car involved in the robbery. Investigators tracked down the driver of the car, who led them to the house where Rick lived.  Then the driver went to the precinct, where he looked through booking photos of people with the name Richard and Rick that matched the description the victim and a security guard had given: A   Hispanic or   man with long hair pulled back.  The driver was on photo 202 when he saw Mr. Jones. A lineup was made, a very suggestive one, and shown to the security guard and another passenger in the car, said Alice Craig, the lead attorney who worked to free Jones. He was the only   man in the lineup. The victim later IDed Richard (Jones) as the one who committed the crime, during a preliminary hearing and trial. It didnt matter that Jones had a solid alibi, Craig said.  He was at his girlfriends birthday party, where several guests testified they saw him, and he had spent the next day watching movies with the girlfriend and cleaning up after the party. Jones did live in Kansas City, but on the Missouri side.   The discrepancies didnt matter to the jury and Jones was sentenced to 19 years on aggravated robbery because he had prior convictions.  Jones appealed and lost. Then he learned about the Midwest Innocence Project, which partners with the University of Kansas Project for Innocence. Craigs team investigates and litigates cases for the Project for Innocence.  Tracking down the doppelganger    Craig said they launched their investigation into the case by reading police reports and trial transcripts.  We were concerned because it was based solely on eyewitness identification, Craig said. At trial, the two guys that were in the vehicle both said that Richard looked like the guy, but essentially, that isnt the guy. That testimony was crucial to making their case, but Craigs team couldnt overturn the conviction without a suspect. The first thing we did was, my interns went out to interview Richard and thats how we got Rickys name, Craig said. Richard told them, Im not sure if this means anything, but guys in here (jail) say, Hey, theres a guy named Ricky who lives in Kansas City, Kansas, who looks just like you.  Craigs team looked into the lead and saw the striking similarities between the two mugshots. They found that Ricky Amos was associated with the address linked to the crime.  Next we took Rickys mugshots to the two guys in the car, the security guard, and the victim and asked, If you were presented with these two, would you be able to choose who did the crime? They said no and presented us with affidavits that we took to a judge, Craig said.  The judge reversed the jury trial and the state dismissed the case, she said.    Getting reacquainted with family  Jones is 41 now and plans to enjoy his freedom and spend time with his family.   Hes doing great. He has a lot of family support, Craig said.   That support includes his two daughters, who grew up without him.   One daughter is only 17 now. She had never seen him before, and he has two grandchildren from an older daughter, Craig said.   Does Jones wish Amos any ill will? Craig said, I dont think so, because its not Rickys fault that this happened, but ultimately he was the one we believe who was responsible for the crime. Ricky has never admitted to the crime and I think he [Jones] . .. was somewhat disappointed that he didnt admit to [it].  The statute of limitations on the crime has passed, so if there was a case against Amos, he cannot be prosecuted. Amos was recently released from prison, according to Todd Fertig with the Kansas Department of Corrections. His previous convictions include aggravated sexual battery, drug possession and robbery.  The one thing Richard always says is, he was pretty bitter for a while. He could never figure out why people would have picked him as the one who committed the crime, but when we showed him Rickys photo, he understood. From the outside looking in, he gets that they look so much alike. Jones cant get the last 17 years of his life back, and though most states have compensation laws for people who have been wrongfully incarcerated, Kansas does not.  Is a lawsuit in the future?  He is certainly considering it, Craig said."
Paul Ryan gave a spot-on speech on the baseball shooting,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/14/2017,"(CNN) Theres a lot of awfulness in Washington today as the city and its political class grapple with the shootings at a Republican baseball practice that left five people wounded including Rep. Steve Scalise, the 3rd ranking Republican in the House. But, out of awfulness (almost) always comes some good. And, the speech Speaker Paul Ryan gave on the House floor today honoring the victims and urging unity very much qualifies.   The whole speech is at the bottom of this post and, if you havent read it yet, you should. I plucked out a few lines that I thought were extremely well said and moving. Theyre below.  1. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. Its easy to lose sight of our common humanity    whether you are a member of Congress or not. The tendency, particularly in our current national political environment, is to focus on what divides us, how different we are. Step back from that narrow focus, however, and you see we have much more in common than we differ on. Family, friends, food to eat, a place to live. Dreams and hopes. 2. There are many memories from this day we will want to forget, and many images we will not want to see again. But there is one image in particular that this House should keep. And that is a photo I saw of our Democratic colleagues gathered in prayer this morning after hearing the news. We tend, in circumstances like these, to remember the bad stuff. But, Ryans right. We need to push all that out and put some good images there instead. Heres the picture he was talking about. 3.  We feel so deeply about the things we fight for and believe in. At times, our emotions can get the best of us. This is right on. Fortunately, for most of us, we get passionate, argue and then move on. Increasingly people    in Congress and out of it    are unable to do that.  Disagreeing without being disagreeable    or even without getting and staying really angry    has become impossible or close to it. 4. For all the noise and fury, we are a family. These were our brothers and sisters in the line of fire. Again, a terrific reminder by Ryan of our common humanity.  Politics    whether you are an elected official, a reporter, a staffer or someone who just follows it closely    is more vocation than job. The vast, vast majority of us are in this because we are interested in the   political and policy debates in the country. 5. So before this House returns to its business, I want us to slow down and reflect, to think about how we are being tested right now. Slow down. Take a breath. Realize that the goal of attacks like this is to highlight our differences. Allowing that to happen makes what James Hodgkinson did have real power. Coming together after such an attack neuters it of meaning. 6. I ask each of you to join me in resolving to come together. ..to lift each other up. ..and to show the country   show the world   that we are one House. The world is watching how Congress    and the rest of the country    reacts to this shooting. Ryan is trying to make sure members draw a distinction between political differences and human differences    and to remember that we might have plenty of the former but we have far fewer of the latter. Full text of Ryan Speech, My colleagues: There are strong emotions throughout this House today. We are all horrified by this dreadful attack on our friends and colleagues, and those who serve and protect this Capitol. We are all praying for those who were attacked and their families:   Scalise,   Barth,   Mika,   Agent David Bailey,   Agent Crystal Griner, We are all giving our thoughts to those currently being treated for their injuries AT THIS MOMENT. And we are united. We are united in our shock and anguish. An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us. I know we want to give our thanks to the first responders and the Alexandria Police Department, who were on the scene in minutes. And I know this House wants to state unequivocally that we are, as ever, awed by the tremendous bravery of the Capitol Police. I spoke with Special Agent Bailey and Special Agent Griner this morning. ..I expressed our profound gratitude to them. It is clear to me, based on eyewitness accounts, that without these heroes, Agents Bailey and Griner, many lives would have been lost. I know we all want to learn as much as we can about what happened. We just received a briefing from the Sergeant at Arms. I have complete confidence in the investigation that is being conducted by the Capitol Police working with local law enforcement. I know we want to extend our gratitude for the outpouring of support we have received from throughout the Capitol and from throughout the country. Now, knowing Steve Scalise as we all do, he is likely really frustrated that he will not be able to play in the baseball game. I also know that Steve wants all of us to commend the bravery of those who came to the aid of the wounded. In the coming days, we will hear their stories, and we will have the chance to hold up their heroism. My colleagues, there are many memories from this day we will want to forget, and many images we will not want to see again. But there is one image in particular that this House should keep. And that is a photo I saw of our Democratic colleagues gathered in prayer this morning after hearing the news. You know, every day, we come here to test and challenge each other. We feel so deeply about the things we fight for and believe in. At times, our emotions can get the best of us. We are all imperfect. But we do not shed our humanity when we enter this chamber. For all the noise and fury, we are a family. These were our brothers and sisters in the line of fire. These were our brothers and sisters who ran into danger and saved countless lives. So before this House returns to its business, I want us to slow down and reflect, to think about how we are being tested right now. Because we are. I ask each of you to join me in resolving to come together. ..to lift each other up. ..and to show the country   show the world   that we are one House. The peoples House   united in our humanity. It is that humanity which will win the day. It always will."
Australia agrees to pay $70 million to Manus Island detainees,CNN,Ben Westcott,6/14/2017,"(CNN) The Australian government has agreed to pay detainees on Manus Island more than $70 million (US$52. 75 million) in the largest settlement in a human rights   in the countrys history. More than 1, 900 detainees had alleged they suffered serious physical and psychological injuries during their time in the Australian governments offshore asylum seeker detention center on the Papua New Guinea island, between 2012 and 2016. Australian law firm Slater and Gordon, who represented the plaintiffs, confirmed Wednesday a deal had been struck with the government, although it had yet to be approved by the court. Majid Kamasaee, a    Iranian detainee, who was held on the center for 11 months after fleeing Iran, was the lead plaintiff in the case.  I came to Australia seeking peace but I was sent to Manus which was hell, Kamasaee said in a statement after the announcement. I was in pain every minute of every day and I cried every night until I had nothing left. Australia has long been criticized for its offshore detention centers, including the one on Manus, where it has held thousands of asylum seekers and refugees since 2012 who have attempted to reach its shores. Claims of psychological trauma, physical illness, self harm attempts and even violent attacks have been regularly reported at the camps since they were opened. At least three people have died. In a statement released Wednesday, the Australia Immigration Ministers office said they strongly refuted the detainees claims and the settlement was not an admission of liability. The Australian government announced in August 2016 it would close the Manus Island center, although there has been no update on when exactly it might happen. As of April, 821 men were still detained by Australia on Manus Island. Almost a quarter of all those held by Australia have been in detention for more than two years. Settlement could lead to other claims, The large settlement for the Manus detainees could leave the Australian government open to other class actions, including from asylum seekers held on Nauru, Ben Saul, University of Sydney Challis Chair of International Law, told CNN. They settled to make it go away so I think that does give a fairly good indication that even the government thinks the treatment of people in detention was not satisfactory by existing legal standard, he said. Saul said about $70 million was a substantial settlement and provided some sort of vindication for outside observers who had been calling for compensation for years, including the United Nations. But 50, 000 for losing years of your life into the black hole of illegal detention is hardly going to give you your life back, he said. Slater and Gordon principal lawyer Andrew Baker told reporters Wednesday the detainees on Manus Island no longer had to suffer in silence. Most were fleeing religious persecution and violence and came to Australia seeking protection, only to be denied their basic human rights, he said. A stunning admission Opponents to Australias offshore detention centers for asylum seekers were quick to celebrate the settlement. The decision by the Australian Government to pay compensation . .. is a stunning admission of the barbaric conditions in the detention center, independent politician Andrew Wilkie said in a statement. Its unambiguous proof of the need to shut down all offshore processing immediately . .. Australias response to asylum seekers is unethical and illegal under international law. Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International accused Australia in August 2016 of deliberately abusing refugees to stop people seeking asylum in the country. Australian Greens party Immigration spokesman Nick McKim said in a statement the settlement showed the government was responsible for the deliberate harm suffered by detainees. By accepting this settlement, (Immigration Minister) Peter Dutton takes responsibility for the deaths, the serious injuries, the torture and the ongoing harm to Manus Island detainees, he said."
Mueller meets with Senate Russia investigators,CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/14/2017,"(CNN) Special counsel Robert Mueller met on Capitol Hill with the leaders of the Senate intelligence committee Wednesday afternoon, a   connection as lawmakers and federal investigators plot a path forward on the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Mueller met with Senate intelligence chairman Richard Burr and Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the committee, in a secure room.   Burr told CNN they had a good meeting with Mueller. Burr and Warner have been pressing for the meeting with Mueller since he was first appointed a month ago. The two sides have been discussing deconfliction    or how the Senate investigation and the federal probe will share information and not step on each others toes.  A major test on that front will be whether the FBI is willing to release memos from former FBI Director James Comey of his conversations with President Donald Trump, now that they have been provided to Mueller. Asked about the Comey memo, Burr said the committee got clarity on whether it can obtain the document, but he would not say whether that means the committee will receive it. Burr also said he didnt think they would meet in person with Mueller again, but would be in touch if deconfliction issues arise. I dont think its necessary for us to meet (again), Burr said. I think well be in communication personally with him on any aspects that might bleed over from one to the other.  Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats will meet with members of the committee Thursday, one week after his tense grilling by the panel.  A committee source confirmed Wednesday that Coats would testify in a closed session.  Coats appearance comes after he promised to answer questions about whether Trump pressured him to rebut stories about the focus of the federal Russia probe. Coats largely declined to answer those questions in a public hearing last week, but he said he would say more in a closed session if he received clearance from the White House. National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers was on the Hill Monday for a similar   briefing with Senate Russia investigators on whether he was pressured by Trump."
What would happen if Trump tried to fire special counsel Mueller,CNN,Paul Callan,6/14/2017,"(CNN) Newsmax CEO Christopher Ruddy created a storm of controversy when he suggested Monday that President Trump was contemplating firing the newly appointed Special Counsel Robert Mueller III, a man destined to be a festering thorn in the side of the Trump administration for months or years to come. And on Tuesday, aboard Air Force One, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders addressed the idea of firing Mueller with these words: while the President has the right to, he has no intention to do so.  Sanders declined to say whether Trump had confidence in Mueller.  Can the President indeed fire the special counsel? The simple answer is that he most certainly can but only through the Justice Department chain of command    and the political cost would be great. The possibility that Trump might at some point want to fire Mueller has to be viewed quite seriously.  As the former host of both The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice, not to mention his lengthy career as a real estate and branding entrepreneur, President Trump brings a special expertise to the subject of firing people. Just ask former FBI Director James Comey. Unlike the Presidents successful TV program, where ratings seemed to rise each time he fired someone, his already lackluster poll numbers might plummet if he terminates Mueller before the special counsel has completed his investigation.  Trump doesnt seem to spend much time reading history books but now might be a good time for him to pick up a good biography of Richard Nixon before he decides to go to war with Mueller. Giving Mueller the ax would strongly evoke memories of the famous Saturday Night Massacre when Richard Nixon tried to fire Archibald Cox, a special prosecutor closing in on him in the Watergate scandal. Attorney General Elliot Richardson refused to carry out Nixons order to fire Cox and resigned as did Richardsons next in command, Deputy Attorney General William Ruckelshaus.  Nixon then turned to the third in the chain of command at the Justice Department, Solicitor General Robert Bork, who promptly followed Nixons order and fired Cox. The massacre resulted in an avalanche of   headlines and press coverage reminiscent of the sinking of the Titanic. And sink Nixon it did with articles of impeachment voted by the Judiciary Committee of The House of Representatives, followed in short order by Nixons resignation in disgrace.   By law, the special counsel is a somewhat independent employee of the Department of Justice.  The department regulation pertaining to the position explicitly permits the firing of the special counsel and the termination of his investigation under certain special circumstances.  The firing requires the personal action of the Attorney General. The grounds for removal are limited to misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of Departmental policies. Subsequently the attorney general is required to report to Congress regarding the termination of the special counsel and his investigation. The intrepid attorney general or acting attorney general who agreed to follow a presidential order to fire Mueller might try to get away with reliance on the good cause provision of the statute given its vagueness. (Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller, testified on Capitol Hill Tuesday that the special counsel could only be fired for good cause and that there was no such cause in this case.)  There also might be a claim of a conflict of interest because of Muellers personal relationship through the years with Comey and possibly with many of the other potential subjects of his investigation. So far none of these claims appear to rise to the level of what lawyers and the court system would label a true conflict of interest. Lots of people have worked together and know each other in the higher echelons of government and that fact alone is not really a legitimate conflict of interest.  A true claim of a Comey conflict of interest would require proof  that Mueller and Comey had a longstanding personal friendship that would clearly impede the impartiality of the special counsel. The public record  generated to date does not reveal a relationship of this nature between the two men.  The President therefore would be on shaky grounds ordering the firing of Mueller under existing Justice Department regulations.  There is no question that as long as Mueller is investigating the possibility of  the Trump campaigns collusion with the Russians and obstruction of justice in the firing of James Comey, a black cloud of adverse publicity will hover over the Trump administration.   The real solution to this problem, if Trumps assertions of innocence are true, is not to fire the special counsel but rather to cooperate fully with him to insure the swift completion of his investigation."
Kamala Harris: Not backing down is in ex-prosecutors DNA,CNN,Faith Karimi,6/14/2017,"(CNN) Kamala Harris has served as freshman senator for only six months, but shes not wasting time sitting in the shadows.  For the second time in a week, the Democratic senator made headlines after her Republican counterparts interrupted her during Senate Intelligence Committee hearings.  Last week, Sens. Richard Burr and John McCain of Arizona cut her off as she questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod J. Rosenstein. Both men did it again on Tuesday, as she questioned Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Heres a look at Harris resume: Objective, Question Trump administration officials during hearings despite interruptions by Republican colleagues. Donald Trump is the best 2020 recruiter Democrats could hope for, Education  Her college education spans two coasts    with a bachelor of arts from Howard University in DC, and a law degree from the University of California, Hastings.  Biographical details, Harris, 52, was born in Oakland, California. Her mother and father were immigrants from India and Jamaica, respectively. Her parents met as civil rights activists at the University of   and got Harris involved in fighting for social justice when she was a baby by wheeling her to protests in a stroller. I grew up with a stroller  view of the civil rights movement, and often I joke that as a child, I was surrounded by adults marching and shouting for this thing called justice,  she says on her website.  Silencing Elizabeth Warren backfires on Senate GOP, Qualifications, Harris is a former San Francisco prosecutor, and is at home at hearings. So her   shots aimed at Sessions may not be a surprise for someone with a background that involved questioning witnesses. She has made her name in   state positions, serving as the district attorney in San Francisco and also as state attorney general.  Shes been vocal about her criticism of Trump and denounced his agenda during a march in Washington a day after his inauguration. Harris says shes never been a fan of the word cant. Most of her life, she says, she has defied suggestions thats its not your turn. Its not your time. She is Californias first   senator and the first   senator in the country. Harris: There is nothing about any of this that is normal Other honors  This is not Harris first national platform. In September 2012, she took the stage at the Democratic National Convention, where she slammed President Barack Obamas political opponents. Her name has come up as a 2020 presidential candidate, but Harris dismisses talk about a future run. Im absolutely not thinking about that at all, she told CNN senior political commentator David Axelrod. Whether she runs or not, shes already making a difference. Her voice isnt just a good one, its a necessary one to help capture all the energy and enthusiasm that Democrats on the left have right now, said  Bill Burton, Democratic strategist and former Obama adviser. Harris has been described as a fresh face for a party desperately searching for a new generation of leaders. She has a sense of youth, glamour and charisma, writes CNNs Maeve Reston.  References  Former President Obama once described her as brilliant . .. dedicated and tough, following that up with a statement about her looks during a fundraising stop in San Francisco four years ago. Um, that statement did not go too well. She is someone who has great instincts about how to get engaged in a fight, Burton said. But not everyone is buying into the hype. If there was a normal administration in power, she would probably not be as prominent, said John J. Pitney, a politics professor at Claremont McKenna College in California.

Jury asks to see footage of Philando Castiles death -- again,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/14/2017,"(CNN) Jurors in the manslaughter trial of a Minnesota police officer finished their second day of deliberations Tuesday with no verdict after reviewing footage of Philando Castiles final moments. The jury asked to see the videos again Tuesday as they weighed the fate of St. Anthony Police Officer Jeronimo Yanez. He faces up to 20 years in prison on charges from the July 6 shooting, which led to nationwide protests and renewed debate over excessive force after Castiles girlfriend broadcast the incident on Facebook Live. In four days of testimony, prosecutors attempted to portray Yanez as a nervous officer who lost control of a traffic stop and was too quick to pull the trigger based on an unreasonable suspicion that Castile was a robbery suspect. Yanez testified in his defense that he shot Castile because he thought he was going to die. Yanez said he saw Castiles hand on a gun after he told him not to reach for it.  His lawyer, Earl Gray, told the jury that Castile would still be alive if he wasnt stoned and had followed Yanezs instructions. What the videos show, The panel of eight men and four women, which includes one black man and one black woman, watched intently as both videos were played in open court on Tuesday. Diamond Reynolds video did not show what happened before the shooting. It showed her crying and screaming as a red stain spread across Castiles white shirt and he uttered his last words: I wasnt reaching for it.  Prosecutors showed dashcam footage from Yanezs vehicle to fill in the gaps and support their claim that Yanez failed to give clear instructions, escalating what one officer described as a relaxed and calm situation to bloodshed within a minute of approaching the vehicle. Castile is clearly heard on the dashcam audio telling Yanez he has a firearm after the officer asks for his license and insurance. The footage shows Yanez drawing his gun as he yells at Castile Dont reach for it. Seconds later, Yanez fired seven shots, five of them striking Castile. In an attempt to prove Yanez was negligent, prosecutors asked police witnesses how they would handle a situation if a person told them they had a gun. Officer Joseph Kauser, second on the scene, said he would ask where the gun was and tell the person to keep their hands on the steering wheel or dashboard. Yanez gave no such instructions. His lawyers said he did not have the time to do so because the situation escalated so quickly. The defense called a police training and firearms expert, who said Yanez acted appropriately given his impression Castile was reaching for a gun. What the videos dont show, Neither video replayed in court Tuesday showed Castiles gun, another crucial issue in the trial. Police witnesses gave conflicting accounts about the firearm.  One officer said he saw the gun slide out of Castiles pocket as he was placed on a medical backboard another said he saw an officer reach into his pocket and pull it out. Yanez faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of manslaughter. He also faces five years each on two charges of dangerous discharge of a firearm for endangering the lives of Reynolds and her    daughter in the backseat."
How a vivid dream led the first Jordanian to Explorers Grand Slam,CNN,Bianca Britton,6/14/2017,"(CNN) In 2004, Mostafa Salameh had a vivid dream: he was praying for peace on the top of a mountain.  I woke up sweating and I saw myself on top of the world, Salameh tells CNN. Back then, Salameh had no expedition experience, little money and couldnt have pointed to Mount Everest on a map. Fast forward to 2017, and he has become the first Jordanian to complete the Explorers Grand Slam, which entails climbing the Seven Summits, including Mount Everest, and reaching the North and South poles. Only 15 other people have ever achieved the Grand Slam. His amazing life has now become the subject of an international book, published by Bloomsbury and endorsed by King Abdullah II of Jordan and British adventurer Ranulph Fiennes. Mostafa Salameh claims each of us has an Everest within us this book persuades us we can all achieve our goals if we have the courage to begin trying, Fiennes wrote. Dreams of a refugee, One of 10 children, Salameh was born to Palestinian parents in Kuwait, where he grew up in a compound for Palestinian and Syrian refugees. We lived in a refugee camp in three small rooms    one had nine bunk beds in the common room which was also the kitchen and my mum and dad slept in another room. Aged 18, Salameh relocated to Amman, Jordan, where his family joined him several years later during the Gulf War. Salameh found work as a waiter. His life was like that of thousands of other refugees across the Middle East, until the brother of Jordans ambassador to England came into his restaurant. He mentioned that the ambassador was looking for someone to work in the kitchen of his London house.  I was serving him and he said, Do you want to come to London?  Salameh says.  That was 1992. His stint with the ambassador lasted for one year, after which Salameh continued living in the UK as an illegal immigrant, earning a living working in kitchens, and dedicating much of his time to improving his English. In 1998, he moved to Scotland to study hotel management at Queen Margaret University and, subsequently, became food and beverage manager of a   hotel. While living in Scotland, he says he disconnected from Islam and embraced the drinking and clubbing side of British culture. Then, in 2004, he had the dream. Explorers Grand Slam challenge, Almost immediately afterward, Salameh stopped partying, smoking and began training for the Explorers Grand Slam.  The biggest challenge was finding the money to fund his adventure.  I went to Jordan for two weeks and tried to get a sponsor but everyone thought I was totally mental, he recalls. Nobody climbed mountains back then. We thought these things were for Westerners. In the end, support did come from his home country, but in a very round about way. An article about Salamehs aspirations in  Edinburgh newspaper The Scotsman made several references to King Abdullah II of Jordan, in a plucky bid to get his attention. It worked and Salameh was invited to Jordan to meet the kings representatives. They said they would fund his training in Nepal, Tibet and North America and, if he was successful in climbing Denali, would also provide financial backing for his Everest attempt. They said if I couldnt climb the highest point in America then I should just leave (my dream) because maybe its not for me, Salameh says. It was a big budget. From 2004, until I went to Everest for the first time in 2005 youre talking about $200, 000 to $250, 000.  He spent the money on his training, gear, accommodation and    living.  (King Abdullah) was the first who believed in me. Then other companies in Jordan started to believe in me because he did, Salameh says.  He received financial support from Infrastructure group Manaseer, telecommunication network Umniah, Jordan Kuwait Bank and pharmaceutical company Hikma. Third time lucky on Everest, First, Salameh tackled the highest points in North America (Denali    20, 310 feet) and Antarctica (Vinson Massif    16, 050 feet) then he set Mount Everest in his sights. In March 2005, he was in Nepal on the side of the worlds tallest mountain, but was forced to turn back just 6, 000 feet from the summit due to a stomach ulcer. I could have continued, but I wanted to go back alive. I wanted my 10 fingers and 10 toes and to tell my story, he says. I didnt want to become one of those people that died on Everest. Two years later, he tried again, but was defeated by a chest infection. Finally, in 2008 after 72 days, Salameh reached the 29, 029 feet summit of Everest, the first Jordanian to do so. His monumental achievement fell on Jordans Independence Day, May 25. He became a national hero in Jordan overnight, receiving the Independence Medal and being knighted by King Abdullah II. In between his attempts to conquer Everest, Salameh had been ticking off other summits: Russias Mount Elbrus (18, 510 ft) in 2005, Tanzanias Mount Kilimanjaro (19, 340 ft) in 2007, Argentinas Aconcagua (22, 831 ft) in 2008, and Indonesias Carstensz Pyramid (16, 023 ft) in 2012. With the seven summits under his belt he had one last hurdle: to trek to the North and South Poles. 56 grueling days, The hardest thing Ive done is definitely the South Pole    harder than Everest, Salameh says. We were there for 56 days. You have to carry everything and do everything on your own unlike in Everest where you have lots of people there. There you have Sherpa (people) who are helping and somebody who will cook your food.  It also involved learning new skills, such as skiing.  It was freezing    so for somebody like me coming from the desert and spending all those months in the South Pole was definitely tough. Very, very tough. He reached the North Pole in April 2014, and the South Pole in January 2016, making Salameh one of only 16 people to have completed the Explorers Grand Slam. Promoting a tolerant, peaceful message, During his quest to complete the Grand Slam, Salameh became increasingly religious and he says his explorations are motivated by a desire to inspire other Muslims. Its not about me going and being the first, its more about me going and delivering a message, he says.  In between his challenges, he gives inspirational talks to students and guides mountaineering trips. The main reason Im doing this is to inspire the young generation in the Middle East to try and look at the world in a different way . .. Theres lots of things going on in the Middle East that really demotivates lots of young children. Salameh also says hes determined to spread the message of tolerance and peace to British and European Muslims.  They need to have a role model, he says. Ive been sending messages to them and telling them they can achieve things in life and that all these stupid things we hear from ISIS doesnt represent anything we believe in. Hes also used his expeditions to support charities, having raised over $4. 2 million for the King Hussein Cancer Center, the Karam Foundation for Syrian refugee youth and the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) for schools in Gaza. Beyond the Explorer Grand Slam  In 2016, Salameh released the book, Dreams of a Refugee: From the Middle East to Mount Everest. A sequel could well be on the way, as Salamehs story is far from finished. Last month, he ticked off another Jordanian first by skiing from the north to the south of Greenland.  It was tough, he laughs. I underestimated Greenland.  One of (our team) had to wake up every two hours to stand outside and make sure no polar bears were going to eat us. We had to climb up mountains to avoid open water and the weather started at   degrees (  degrees Fahrenheit) and then you would end up at 30 degrees (86 degrees Fahrenheit) sledging   kilograms behind you. However, despite its challenges, he says he was blown away by the countrys beauty. It was one of the most beautiful things Ive ever seen    more beautiful than the South and North Pole because of all the views. Whats next?  For now, Salameh is living at home in Dublin, Ireland, with his British wife and three children, aged two, five and seven. Next, he plans on returning to Everest to lead an   Jordanian expedition. Salameh says he carefully chose five Jordanian women so that they would represent the different backgrounds and religions of Jordan. This is so anybody who watches the TV to see what these women are doing can look at it and think: I could do this. Salameh says he wont stop delivering positive messages. I want to make a change in the Middle East. I want to make a change in Britain. Its about achieving that dream and telling people that nothing is impossible."
Columnist: How was Sen. Harris hysterical?,CNN,Leinz Vales,6/14/2017,"(CNN) CNN political analyst Kirsten Powers pushed back against former Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller on Tuesday for calling California Sen. Kamala Harris hysterical during her questioning of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. In speaking to CNNs Anderson Cooper about Sessions performance at the Senate intelligence committee hearing, Miller said the attorney general knocked away some of the hysteria from Kamala Harris and some of the Democrats who wanted to make this a big partisan show. Powers fired back at Miller, asking him, How was Sen. Kamala Harris hysterical? It didnt seem like there was any effort to try to get to a real question or to the bottom of things, Miller responded. I think she asked a lot of questions, Powers said. She was very dogged. I wouldnt say she was any more dogged than Sen. Ron Wyden was, would you say that? I think she was hysterical, Miller said. I dont think Sen. Wyden was trying to get to the bottom of answers either. But he wasnt hysterical, she was, Powers said. She was trying to shout down Attorney General Sessions and I thought it was way out of bounds, Miller replied. This is the second hearing in a row. Not backing down is in Kamala Harris DNA, While asking Sessions about his refusal to answer questions Tuesday concerning conversations he may have had with President Donald Trump, Harris, a California Democrat, was interrupted by Sen. John McCain of Arizona. The exchange was an almost exact repeat of last week, when McCain cut in on her intense questioning of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and committee Chairman Richard Burr told her to stop and let Rosenstein answer. CNN contributor and Trump supporter Jeffrey Lord added to the fiery exchange between Powers and Miller, saying, Hysteria is a neutral quality.  And yet, its just women that usually are called hysterical, Powers said."
How a baseball practice turned into terror,CNN,Stephen Collinson,6/14/2017,"(CNN) All they expected to hear was the crack of bat on ball. But with one loud blast of a gunshot, early morning batting practice turned to terror for Republican lawmakers, staffers and one small boy, as a lone assailant sprayed bullets across a baseball diamond, sending them fleeing for their lives. Their unimaginable ordeal in the line of fire unfolded over 10 terrible minutes at a neighborhood field in Alexandria, Virginia, as players piled into dugouts seeking shelter, armed only with bats to repel bullets. Trapped, as a war zone scene played out before them, they watched helplessly as a wounded colleague, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise, dragged himself along the ground    leaving a trail of blood on the infield. Shaken and emotional, they later admitted they owed their lives to the heroism of   police officers who stood up to a barrage of automatic fire, eventually mortally wounding the gunman, even after they themselves were hit. And as President Donald Trump called for unity, Washingtons political players and their chroniclers were left to question the viciousness of a political culture that may have spawned such a ferocious attack that injured Scalise, a congressional staffer, two police officers and a lobbyist playing with the team. Alabama Republican Mo Brooks was just about to hit on a warm morning just after 7 a. m. as lawmakers limbered up for Thursdays   congressional charity game at Nationals Park, home to the citys professional baseball club. I was on deck, about to hit home plate, and I hear a loud Bam! And I look around, and behind third base . .. I see a rifle, Brooks told CNN. Then I hear another Bam! and realize theres an active shooter. At the same time, I hear Steve Scalise over near second base scream. He was shot. Illinois Rep. Rodney Davis echoed Brooks shock. I was batting. We heard a loud noise    felt like a construction site and somebody dropped a big piece of metal and someone on the field yelling Run, hes got a gun.  Eyewitness Marty LaVoies first thought was how    it was to see someone open fire on a ball field. I looked over and saw a man behind third base. I saw this long weapon    what went through my mind is, why would anybody have a rifle shooting birds at a baseball practice? he said. Someone in the dugout literally saved my life because they said stay down. Another witness, David Woodruff, was out for his morning run, and remembers thinking it was early for people to be practicing baseball. I heard 12, 14 or so gunshots ring out . .. they were going one right after another. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul said on CNN that bullets were flying everywhere and that a congressional staffer climbed a   fence in three seconds and flopped down beside him near a big oak tree behind a batting cage. The gunshots were going into the warning track about five or 10 feet from us and at some point Id say 50 or 60 shots at least had been fired from the shooter, Paul said. Scalise had been playing second base, opposite the third base dugout area from where the gunman, later identified as Illinois man James T. Hodgkinson who vehemently opposed Trump, appeared to be firing from. As the gun battle raged between Hodgkinson and Capitol Police officers on Scalises detail, his colleagues watched as the majority whip floundered. He dragged himself off of infield into outfield and there was a trail we could see where he had been, said Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, who later arrived on Capitol Hill still in his cleats, and recalled gunshots kicking up the dirt. Brooks also noticed Scalise was in trouble: He had crawled into the outfield, was leaving a trail of blood. Scalise was not able to move on his own power. He was dragging his body from the second base infield, where its dirt, to the outfield to get away from the shooter while all this firing was going on, Brooks said. Hours later, Davis reflected on the horrible experience of seeing his colleague exposed and being unable to help as bullets flew. I watched my friend and my fellow member Steve Scalise lay motionless on the field, wondering if he was going to be OK. That is a picture I will never forget. After Scalise was cut down, fellow players and onlookers rushed for safety. The fear factor was horrific, because by the time I got into the dugout I saw several other members bleeding, Tennessee Rep. Chuck Fleischmann told CNN. I saw one gentleman who had been shot in the leg. There was blood all over and it was horrible, but we did not know when it was going to end. Ohio Rep. Brad Wenstrup, an army veteran, later told an aide the shooting was like being in Iraq again, only without his weapon. He started at a position of advantage beyond the third base dugout, and no one is over there, Wenstrup told CNNs Jake Tapper on The Lead. Everyone is on the first base side. And I was along the first baseline. I could see him. And then he went behind the dugout. Then he came closer to home plate on the other end of the dugout. Shot from there. Then he went behind the building thats behind home plate and came around the back of that, all the while coming closer to all the people who were there and taking their escape route and hiding behind trees or whatever they could do, taking cover. He was moving in towards us, towards our only escape route, Wenstrup added. He was methodically moving everyone into one area where he had hoped to, I believe, open fire. Huddled in the dugout, the lawmakers tried to protect the    son of Texas Rep. Joe Barton: We got him in the dugout, we put him under a bench, Flake said. The Arizona senator, later cleaned up and wearing a suit, told CNN of the moment he came    with the shooter. I wanted to get out to where Steve Scalise was to see if we could drag him over to the dugout, so I stood up and the gunman was there just behind the fence behind home plate.  He caught sight of where I was, and so we quickly a bunch of us jumped down so as not to be in the line of fire. Fleischmann told of his own lucky escape.  I had to walk right past him when I walked past third base from left field. He just decided not to shoot me, so, I was very fortunate, Fleischmann said, relating how he took cover in a dugout, fearing for his life. We were scared because when the gunfire didnt stop we thought, Oh my gosh, hes gonna come in there, and were like sitting ducks, Fleischmann said. Brooks told CNN that he saw one of the good guys    a member of the Scalise security detail blasting away. It was pistol versus rifle along the third baseline just outside the chain link fence and he was ordering us to stay down. Another security detail person was closer to home plate, probably. Brooks remembered the moment when the horror ended. Eventually, the shooter starts circling around third base    this is my understanding. Im down on the ground helping a guy whos got a bullet hole in his leg. And the shooter starts coming around home plate where we are, outside the fence line.  And my understanding is thats where our security detail . .. took him down. With the shooter immobilized, thoughts again turned to Scalise. Wenstrup, a physician, got to work to try to stem the bleeding. Brooks said that he helped by putting pressure on the wound as his colleague used scissors to cut Scalises clothing. Flake said Scalise was conscious the whole time and asked for water before he was taken away in a helicopter. Many of those on the scene reflected how they owed their lives to the officers in the Scalise detail. Nobody would have survived without the Capitol Hill police, Paul said on CNN. It would have been a massacre without them. Flake noted that the gunman had a lot of ammunition, and things could have been so much worse. It would have been a horrible scene . .. if he makes it there to the dugout, then youre in trouble. South Carolina Rep. Jeff Duncan had just left the practice when a man believed to be Hodkingson came up to him. Someone in the parking lot who asked me if the team practicing was a Democrat or Republican team. I told him they were Republicans, he said. This being Washington, politics quickly broke out, with New York Rep. Chris Collins blaming   rhetoric from the left for the warped public debate that led to the shooting. Twitter fights, predictably, soon raged. But others began to contemplate whether the bitter tone of the public square and root, root, rooting for the home team in politics had gone too far, as normal political barriers, for once, came down. This has to be the breaking point. Is this Americas breaking point when it comes to the political rhetoric thats become so hateful? Davis asked. I never thought I would play a baseball game for charity, go to practice at 6:30 in the morning and have to dodge bullets. Rep. Richard Hudson isnt on the team and was leading a Bible study group when the shooting happened. But he was particularly moved that an Indivisible   group in his district in North Carolina posted that they were glad he was safe. That really meant a lot to me, he said adding it made him want to reconsider his relationship with them. Rep. Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania, a pitcher on the team, who was not at the practice, choked back tears as he spoke of his teammates. Its one of the things that makes you feel more normal. The camaraderie that we have in the mornings, he said. He got emotional again when describing how a Democratic member, Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, came up to him Wednesday morning and gave him a hug. It tells you how much we share, he said, fighting back tears. Its a good thing we dont want to stop. Among the most poignant of comments came from someone who knows what the lawmakers felt when they were under fire. This shooting is an attack on all who serve and on all who participate in our democracy, said Gabrielle Giffords, a former Arizona representative who was shot in 2011. Back in Alexandria, meanwhile, the ball field had become a crime scene, with discarded bats and equipment laying on the ground, hinting at the story of how a normal, early morning practice suddenly turned into 10 minutes of terror."
The internet roasted David West and Tristan Thompson after they got a little too close during an altercation in Game 5,Business Insider,Tyler Lauletta,6/13/2017,"With the Cleveland Cavaliers facing elimination in Game 5 of the   NBA Finals, things got heated leading to an unusual altercation   and and plenty of laughs on social media.     The incident came in the second quarter when Kyrie Irving   drove baseline in an attempt to stop an absolute torrent of   offense coming from the Golden State Warriors. Irvings   floater missed, with David West grabbing the rebound for the   Warriors, but Irving was able to hustle, tussle, and get inside   to force a jump ball.     When the whistle blew, West kept on throwing his elbows while   trying to get sole possession of the ball, and Irvings teammate   Tristan Thompson jumped to his defense. The whistles blew,   technical fouls were assessed.       But then ABC showed the replay. It turns out Thompson and West   came closer and closer. In fact, they seemed to get a little too   close for an altercation.       Needless to say, Twitter had an absolute field day.

GE CEO Jeff Immelt is stepping down  heres how he reshaped the $255 billion companys future,Business Insider,Henry Blodget,6/13/2017,"When Jeff Immelt became the CEO of General Electric in 2001,   he was following Jack Welch, one of the   centurys most   prominent corporate leaders. Just days after he took over the   corner office, the US was attacked on September 11. Then came the   financial crisis and the Great Recession.   During his tenure, Immelt has fundamentally reshaped GE,   shedding businesses and reversing a century of   conglomeration.     Immelt is What follows is the transcript of a 2015   conversation between Immelt and Business Insiders Henry Blodget   about the transformation of GE.  Henry Blodget: I read an article recently that   said that after 14 years at the helm, you have finally remade GE   and made it your own. So what is that?  Jeff Immelt: In 2001, GE was just a classic   conglomerate: financial services, media,   industrial. I always had an idea to maybe make   the company more focused on those things that I thought we were   best at, and thats a     global   product and service enterprise. And thats what we are today.     Were the worlds biggest infrastructure technology company. We   more or less had this vision 10 or 15 years ago, but certainly,   the financial crisis accelerated some of the activities along   those lines.  Blodget: If you had the vision 15 years ago, why   did it take so long?  Immelt: With a company our size its always   steps and transitions you make over time. Early on, we started   exiting some of the pieces of financial services, some of the   more commodity businesses, like plastics, and things like that.   And the idea we had was to do this over a relatively long period   of time, keep the earnings power in place but transition the   pieces as time goes on, and again this wasnt just for GE, but   for the world.     The biggest impediment     or lets say the biggest challenge and   opportunity     was the financial crisis, which in many ways   affected anybody that was in financial services the day Lehman   Brothers went bankrupt. The whole world got   and so that   in some ways made it slower than we wanted it to be but in some   ways made us even more determined to get to the point were at   right now.     Blodget: One of the businesses you sold was   NBCUniversal. Was that because its a crappy business?  Immelt: No, its high margin. Its an   interesting business. Its filled with great people. But I could   see technology changing. I didnt think, in the end, that we were   willing to do all the things that I viewed as being required to   be successful.     So the two things I viewed as being required to be successful was   either you had to own the distribution the way Comcast has, or   you need to be willing to take any amount of money you have and   invest in transitions to the internet, and I had too many other   opportunities inside the company.     So I think in the world we live in today, unlike 10 or 15 years   ago, if youre not all in seven days a week, 24 hours a day, you   better sell. And thats the way I viewed NBC. And I thought   Comcast [would be the right fit] really not because I thought   theyd run the parks better, or theyd run the network better,   but really because they control distribution. I felt like they   had one of the models that would have the chance to last the   longest, although not without their own disruption that they   would go through.  Blodget: Your biggest changes by far have come   this year. You obviously followed Jack Welch, probably the most   legendary CEO, who in part was driven by finance and building up   GE Capital. And now youve sold that. Given that GE Capital   effectively drove the company over so many years, was that a   tough decision?  Immelt: Those decisions are always tough,   because it impacts people and it is change. But in many ways this   was not that hard because in most companies arithmetic rules, and   if you look at financial services and say, given the current   regulatory environment, the best return I can hope for is single   digits, high single digits maybe. And in our industrial   businesses, we can generate a 17% or 18% return. Its just   arithmetic in the end.     So I think the one thing we did right is we picked the right   time. Weve been able to sell the assets faster at a better price   than we thought. And really it just allows us to position the   company exactly where we want to be. Were kind of the preeminent   industrial company in the world. Thats a good place for GE to   be.  Blodget: When you say, We looked at its   arithmetic. Its a   return here. We can get much   better over here, presumably the buyers are doing the same   analysis?  Immelt: They have a different cost of capital.   So if you think about whos buying   assets, its   either somebody thats huge, like Wells Fargo, or its a     fund that doesnt have the same capital   requirements that a large institution has. So I think what we   could see is that people would value these assets higher outside   GE than they would inside GE, and we thought that made it a good   time to go.     We are almost 140 years old as a company. We started as a     company. If you want to last for a long time, you have   to be fast on your feet. You have to be willing to make these   pivots and transitions, and so for Google to be the same age as   GE, it would have to be the year 2150. Theyre probably going to   be doing other things than search in 2150. So I think thats kind   of the way we look at ourselves as well.  Blodget: My understanding is that a lot of your   big investors were clamoring for you to dump GE Capital as soon   as the financial crisis happened. So as CEO, running a company   like this where you werent the founder, but you come in to   control, whos really driving a decision like that? Is it the   investors?  Immelt: Oh, I mean, look, this is something that   was obvious, really, that didnt take either investors or anybody   else to tell me this, right? Its just     it was arithmetic. Now,   what Ive learned over time and, sometimes the hard way, is,   dont ever start something you cant finish. Think about what   weve done. Well execute on almost $300 billion on exits in one   year. Thats amazing, right? So you cant do that unless the time   is right, and the time was finally right this year.        If youre running a company and you think youre going to read   your strategy in The Wall Street Journal or an analyst report,   youre probably not going to last long. I think what you have to   do is you have to have a good idea of what you want to do and be   completely transparent with your investors. And accountable for   doing what you say youre going to do. And I think thats how   most really good companies operate.     I dont own the company. Were  . Weve got 5   million shareholders, 8 or 9 billion shares outstanding, so   investors matter. But I think what we want them to do is invest   in our aviation business, or our business around the world, or   our healthcare business, because they know what its going to do   and were accountable to achieve results.  Blodget: Many US businesses are underinvesting   in research and development. And you have a lot of CEOs who have   driven great stock performance by cutting R&D, and, lo and   behold, the earnings skyrocket for a few years, stock goes up,   everybody thinks theyre a hero, and then pretty soon the company   has nothing to sell because they havent been reinventing   themselves. Obviously given the size of GE, you have billions of   dollars that you could spend in future R&D or not spend and   put up huge numbers. How do you handle that  ?  Immelt: Were valuable because we make really   difficult things. If you could make something with 60 people in a   garage, GE shouldnt be doing it. But if you make a jet engine,   theres only like one and a half people in the world that can   make a jet engine. And we are really good at that. If you want to   compete with that, youve got to put yourself on a wayback   machine and go back 25 years and invest $1 billion here for 25   years and then maybe, just maybe, youre going to be able to   compete with us.     Now, you need to be transparent about that. You need to be   resolute. We need to deliver on our commitments to our customers,   and our investors need to go through that, but thats why we say   to an investor, Thats why you should own GE, is because we   invest in R&D but we return that R&D into really great   and profitable products that generate   cash flow,     returns. Were smart about what to do with that cash   and things like that.     Ive done this for 14 years. Not every day has been perfect. But   I think the CEOs I admire are ones that can walk and chew gum.   They know how to invest for the long term. They know how to be   accountable to their investors. They know how to be transparent   about what their strategies are, and thats what weve tried to   do in GE. You talk to Jeff Bezos. Talk to some of the guys that I   admire, you know, they basically say, When youre willing to   invest in the hard things, thats how you create a valuable   company.       Blodget: One of the   things you hear every day is, Well weve got to maximize   earnings short term, and then you look over at Amazon, where   they never show earnings, because they take every dollar and they   reinvest it in some project that may or may not pay off in seven   years and heres the stock just crashing through a new high every   day because theyve come up with these amazing businesses.  Immelt: Theres a lot of people who have gotten   fired thinking theyre Jeff Bezos. So I dont want to be Amazon.   I want to be GE.  Blodget: Now its your GE. What is it? Whats   driving the company now? What is the Industrial Internet you   keep talking about?  Immelt: Id say the most interesting thing were   working on right now is quite transformative and that is really   driven by technology. Today, everything we sell is surrounded by   sensors and produces data. The data fundamentally is going to be   modeled and turned into performance, outcomes. Basically   industrial productivity has stunk. If you look and say industrial   productivity is 4% from 1990 to 2010, its 1% right now and its   mainly because theres not enough productivity out of the assets.   So when I talk about the Industrial Internet, its about   capturing data off of machines, turning it back into valuable   insight for our customers and thats going to be worth trillions   of dollars in the economy, and I think its going to transform   GE.     So weve got a digital thread thats running throughout the   company and we have our own   operating system called   Predix. Its open to developers, and were gonna run an operating   system and applications on our assets and on competitors assets   and industrial assets. And that, to me, is probably the most   exciting thing Ive worked on in 30 years.  Blodget: Give us some specific examples.  Immelt: A train has 300 sensors. Each route on a   train might pull a terabyte of data. That data can be modeled on   fuel performance, emissions performance. While the train is   running, you can be taking a picture of the track to see if its   cracked. You can map that train in a fleet of trains. So thats   all valuable information all coming off the control center that   we have on the locomotive.        Now in the rail industry, they have a metric called velocity.   Velocity is the average miles per hour that a locomotive goes   every day. The average locomotive goes 22 mph during the day.   Thats horrible, right? The difference between 23 and 22 for one   Class I railroad is $250 million for earnings.     What makes Facebook awesome? Facebook is awesome because theres   a billion people on Facebook. Thats the consumer in it. The   Industrial Internet is saying, If you can do 1 mph on one Class   I railroad, thats a 20% improvement in their profitability.   Thats going to be done with information and data. And so weve   said in our company, why not us? We can hire the people. We know   the technology. We understand the assets better than anybody in   the world.     And so I think were in the first inning of the Industrial   Internet, and its going to be different than the consumer   internet. And I think theres going to be a couple industrial   companies that get transformed as part of that, and we want to be   one of them.  Blodget: And so will you be using those sensors   and so forth to make locomotives with more productivity?  Immelt: Sure, we already do.  Blodget: Or will you have a software platform   that will help a train company get to 23?  Immelt: We do both. So we make the locomotive,   we make the sensors, but we also have an operating system.  Blodget: And where are we in the life cycle of   that?  Immelt: I think just beginning. In many ways   this is the beginning. Its about $5 billion revenue for us. We   think we can maybe double it or triple it in the next five or 10   years. Theres horizontal companies. Theres IBM and Accenture   and the software SAP, and theres vertical companies     people   like GE that know how to do healthcare, or oil and gas, or power.   Were a vertical company that wants to go horizontal. And I like   our chances as this takes place.            Blodget: And youre competing as you hire the folks who are going   to build all that with all these Silicon Valley companies like   Facebook and Google that seem so much sexier. Youve got these      though, that everybody loves.  Immelt: But the ads are meant to play into that.   So look, the fact of the matter is, people that come to work for   us, theyre going to work for five companies by the time theyre   40. We just want GE to be one of them that they get in their   universe. And the idea is, its a neat idea, but you know, having   a   humor I think opens the door for people, and   we liked the way the ads worked.  Blodget: Lets talk about tax for a second. Its   a huge political issue, inversions, critics talking about these   horrible   corporations who are moving their   headquarters to Europe. GE was pilloried after the financial   crisis for one year not paying income tax because there was a   huge loss the year before. I get it. Theres been some skirmishes   where Connecticut has raised your taxes and youve threatened to   move out. Whats the right philosophy with regard to our taxes,   and is there anything to this argument that, Hey, sure, you   could hire lawyers to figure out how to avoid that tax, but   thats somehow immoral. You should just pay them.  Immelt: There are two different things. We need   tax reform in the US. Our tax code is perverted. It was done in   the 1980s. I would say do  . Do whatever was done by   a bipartisan committee in 2010. Do that. Were OK with that. We   need tax reform. We need to lower the rates, broaden the base, do   away with loopholes. Im game for that.     Because of what weve done with GE Capital our tax charge will be   $6 billion or something like that. Well pay plenty of taxes in   that context. I think the situation in Connecticut is a little   bit divorced from that. Sometimes taxes become a symptom and not   the cause. To a certain extent, sometimes when states cant solve   pension issues or other   problems, it becomes the   only thing they do. That I think is a slightly different issue   than a federal tax policy that needs to be reformed and should   happen now.  Blodget: Its considered totally reasonable for   an individual to move from state to state because the state has a   lower tax rate. And yet when a company tries to do it, theyre   pilloried, tax dodging. Is that reasonable?  Immelt: I think its perfectly reasonable for   companies to want to compete on a global stage. Basically, after   100 years, I dont really have American competitors anymore. My   competitors are Siemens or China South Rail or Hitachi. Id take   any one of their tax policies. Any one of them. Ill do Germany   today. They have a territorial system. You can repatriate cash.   So I just think, instead of blaming everybody, lets fix the   system for everybody.  Blodget: Id love to talk about you for a few   minutes. So youve had this amazing career where youve done the   corporate American dream     go to a great business school, go to a   great company, work your way all the way up, get the corner   office. Its just incredible. One of the things Ive heard you   talk about is football. Ill read you a quote. As I understand,   you played offensive tackle?          Immelt: Yes, glory position.  Blodget: You protect the quarterback.  Immelt: Yes, exactly.  Blodget: So heres the quote: Im a product of   football, and I owe a great deal of gratitude to the system. What   I learned from football enters my life every day. So what is   that?  Immelt: Two things that were seminal for my   education. One was I was a math major. Now I have an   undergraduate degree in math and an MBA.     I use my math major every day. I dont use the MBA quite as much.     The other is team sports. Team sports are really about mutual   accountability, about building a purpose, about resilience, about   persistence, and I think those are the two things that are kind   of interwoven in me as I grew in my career and have been bedrocks   for me since Ive been CEO.  Blodget: Why do you use math and not the MBA?  Immelt: Companies are about problem solving. In   essence, my intellectual curiosity goes more toward problem   solving versus spreadsheets. I know how to do a spreadsheet. I   know how to read a spreadsheet. I know how to do the mechanics of   what it takes to run a business. Im just curious about   everything. I can view every situation as a problem to be solved,   and Ive never lost a passion for that as Ive grown in my   career.  Blodget: Was there a day in your career at GE   where you said, Hey, you know, I could run this place?  Immelt: I would say maybe when I was in my 30s,   late 30s or 40, or something like that. I was doing a sales call   with Jack [Welch] and were out visiting customers and I was   able to see him and other CEOs and I said, I may not be as good   as him. But Im as good as these guys. I can be a CEO if I really   put my mind to it. And then what happened is I really loved all   my GE jobs and it just was the chronology of my age and when it   was right for him to leave that just happened to sync up.     But I never really dwelled on it that much. In other words, I   always knew I could get another job, and I always liked to work.   I always liked the work. Even today, I like the work more than   the job, and I think thats the way I was in my career as well.  Blodget: And you say, It just clicked, but, in   fact, you had probably one of the most public auditions and   competitions for a job that there has ever been. It was all over   the papers that Jack has assembled the three of you and now   youre going to fight to the death and one shall be selected and   everybody else gets fired to go run off to another company. It   was interesting watching from the outside. What is that process   like? It lasted for more than a year where you guys were   practically in a cage match.  Immelt: Really weird is what I would say. No   ones ever done it since.     I always say, Look. If were doing something smart, somebody   elses copying it, right? And if were not doing something smart,   no one else is copying. This is something that no one ever   copied. Maybe that speaks for itself.     I knew if it wasnt GE, I could go do something. I was never hung   up on that. And even today this is where most of my friends are,   so I didnt know how to replace the friends I had and all those   other things. But I just didnt really get sucked up into it.   Everybody else around me was paying attention, including my wife,   who was curious as to whether or not we were going to move or I   was going to get fired or what was going to happen, but for me it   never really impacted me. I didnt think about it.  Blodget: So then you get the job, you get handed   the reins, again, from Jack. The stock had gone up for however   many thousands of years in a row. And the world ends. And they   hand you the reins. Whats that like, in his shadow, presumably,   for years?  Immelt: It may sound naive or difficult to   believe, but I think like, I like the work. I like the people.   I always knew I was going to have to face comparisons and all   that stuff. But look, if youre running GE in any era, its an   interesting job. If you like business, and you like people, this   is pretty much the best job in the world. So I never was   concerned about   or things like that. It was more: Lets look   forward. Whats the company we want to build? Our culture is such   that people dont look backward. I want everybody to respect Jack   Welch. Everybody in the company should know him. But we have more   than 300, 000 people. Theres nobody thats going to work this   morning thinking, Gosh, I wonder what Jack Welch would do.          Blodget: And so you, as you just reminded us, you run a company   with 311, 000 people. What do you do every day when you run a   company with 311, 000 people? Like what is your job?  Immelt: You know, I do charts. The way I would   say it is: Pick people, drive growth, solve problems. OK, so   youve got three essential things, and Id say the fourth one is   just governance: interface with investors, boards, the public,   things like that. And, if you have a big company, more times than   not, it works more on trust than formality.     So I could give you the formal processes, or how we do strategy   or stuff like that, but the place really revolves around having a   core of leaders who come from different backgrounds but have a   shared vision for GE and have common values. I dont think we   ever think were the best at anything. You know, theres a   healthy cynicism about any form of arrogance that would exist.  Blodget: And we had Jim Cramer earlier who told   us about his day, which is pretty much insane for most human   beings how little sleep the man can run on. Are you in that mold?   What is the typical day?  Immelt: So Jimmys a little bit crazier than I   am, but I would say first of all, I travel 70% of the time. I go   places. I see things for myself. I tend to travel by myself and   go see different teams. Im not a great  . I always   tell people, You never meet people at meetings.     When Im in town, I get up at 4:30 a. m. Ill do a quick scan of   the news, Ill exercise, and then kind of an active day. But my   life really revolves around seeing the world, seeing our team,   seeing our customers, seeing our investors, not being in the   office.  Blodget: At GE, do they throw you out at 65, or   could you stay on for longer?"
Mike Pence: Obamacare Death Spiral One of Most Pressing Issues for Americans Today - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/13/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     Vice President Mike Pence highlighted the nearly 2 million Americans who have dropped Obamacare this year in a Tuesday speech to employees at U. S. Health and Human Services ahead of meetings with lawmakers at the White House and on Capitol Hill. [The Vice President called the ongoing collapse of Obamacare     the death spiral     one of the most pressing issues facing Americans today. This will be the North Star of our Administration, Pence said of improving the healthcare system.  We are going to repeal and replace Obamacare, he said, citing the broken promises of the Affordable Care Act. While discussing the promise that premiums would go down, Pence referenced a report that revealed premiums have instead skyrocketed under Obamacare     more than doubling for the average American. While costs are soaring      choices are plummeting. Insurance companies are pulling out of Obamacare left and right, said Pence. A chart displayed above Pence read, Only 10 million enrolled, 28 million still uninsured.  He also referenced the 1. 9 million Americans that signed up for plans on the Obamacare exchanges, but have not followed through on paying their premiums. This figure comes from a new Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) report released on Monday, detailing the 10. 3 million who have paid their premiums as of March 15, out of the 12. 2 million who have signed up. Pence described meeting Julie Champine on a recent trip to Wisconsin. He recalled her story of losing health insurance and her doctor while she faced health issues. She was forced to sign up for an Obamacare plan which in 2016 cost more than $9, 000 in premiums for her family and carries a $13, 000 deductible. Champines plan premium increased another $2, 600 this year, said Pence. Julie told me that her Obamacare health insurance plan costs more than her mortgage and she cant even afford to use it, said Pence. A few months back she dropped her plan for a few months in order to afford Christmas presents for her kids. Pence remarked how important the men and women who serve in U. S. Health and Human Services are and thanked them for their service. HHS Secretary Dr. Tom Price said before introducing Pence, that the work of HHS goes beyond the border of the United States and recalled a recent trip to Liberia. He lauded U. S. efforts to beat back Ebola in Africa. Price remarked of the challenges Americans face when it comes to obtaining quality health care. He voiced the goal of getting us to a healthcare system where Americans can afford health care and health coverage. He spoke of stabilizing markets, opening up enrollment options and        with the goal of installing a more   healthcare system. The Affordable Care Act took a lot of power away from the states, added Price who said they are continuing to make progress on innovations. In early May, health insurer Aetna pulled out of yet another states individual market, Virginia. CNN Money reported that the company cited massive losses under Obamacare as the reason why. Within days, Fox Business reported that Aetna would pull out of Obamacare exchanges completely by 2018. After passing through the U. S. House of Representatives, the American Health Care Act sits waiting for a vote on the floor of the U. S. Senate. The bill is designed to roll back much of President Barack Obamas signature health insurance mandate. The bill has been presented as the first of several phases to dismantle Obamacare. President Trump has often stated that Obamacare is in a death spiral under which healthcare premiums continue to skyrocket. He has promised to repeal Obamacare. Following his speech, the Vice President is traveling to the White House for lunch with President Trump and members of Congress. Afterward, Pence will join lawmakers for the Senate Republican Policy lunch and hold additional meetings."
"Special counsel team members donated to Dems, FEC records show",CNN,Marshall Cohen,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) Three members of the legal team known to have been hired so far by special counsel Robert Mueller to handle the Russia investigation have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records. More than half of the more than $56, 000 came from just one lawyer and more than half of it was donated before the 2016 election, but two of the lawyers gave the maximum $2, 700 donation to Hillary Clinton last year. Over the weekend, news outlets including CNN identified five attorneys that Mueller has already brought on board to help investigate potential collusion between associates of President Donald Trumps campaign and Russia. The group includes seasoned attorneys who worked on cases ranging from Watergate to the Enron fraud scandal and have represented major American companies in court. While only five attorneys have been publicly identified as working on the Russia probe, there could be more on Muellers team. Three of the five lawyers have donations in FEC records. They gave overwhelmingly to Democrats, totaling more than $53, 000 since 1988. More than half of the donations came from just one of the lawyers, James Quarles, whom Mueller brought over from his old firm, WilmerHale. Quarles has given nearly $33, 000 to political campaigns over the years. He gave money to Democratic presidential candidates Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. In addition, Quarles gave more than $10, 000 to help Democrats get elected to the House and another $10, 000 on the Senate side, including money to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But Quarles is also the only lawyer among Muellers team for which records were available who ever donated to Republicans. He gave $2, 500 to Utah Rep. Jason Chaffetz in 2015 and gave $250 to  . George Allen of Virginia in 2005. Only about 30% of the donations were for elections in 2016. But Quarles and Jeannie Rhee, who also left WilmerHale to work on the Russia probe, gave the maximum contribution of $2, 700 to Clintons campaign last year. Rhee was the   donor among Muellers known team. Rhee has donated more than $16, 000 since 2008, all to Democrats. She maxed out to the Clinton campaign in 2016 and 2015, totaling $5, 400. She also gave a total of $7, 300 to Obamas two presidential campaigns. She has already received attention for representing the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering lawsuit brought by a conservative advocacy group, and also represented Clinton herself in a lawsuit seeking access to her private emails. Mueller, who was appointed to be FBI director by Republican President George W. Bush, also hired Andrew Weissmann to join his team. Weissmann, who led the Enron investigation, previously gave $2, 300 to Obamas first presidential campaign in 2008 and $2, 000 to the Democratic National Committee in 2006, the same year Democrats won control of Congress.  FEC records do not show any donations by Weissman in the 2016 election cycle. There also are no FEC records for Aaron Zebley, who left WilmerHale to work on the Russia investigation. Zebley once represented former Hillary Clinton aide Justin Cooper, who helped manager her private email server. Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben has also joined Muellers team. While there is a Michael Dreeben in the FEC database, who is identified as a deputy solicitor with the Justice Department and who gave $1000 to Hillary Clintons senate campaign in 2006, a spokesman for Muellers team told CNN late Monday that that is not the same person. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who endorsed Trump and was on his   shortlist, suggested Monday that Muellers team cant be impartial because of their past donations. Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair, Gingrich tweeted, reversing his previous praise for Mueller. Look who he is hiring. Check FEC reports. Time to rethink. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mueller as special counsel, told senators on Tuesday that he doesnt see any problems with the political donations from some members of Muellers legal team.   Asked by Sen. Lindsey Graham whether political donations should prevent attorneys from working on the investigation, Rosenstein replied, no, senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not. Even with the questions about Muellers team, former independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who led investigations into President Bill Clinton in the 1990s, said he has confidence in the team.  He has his head down, hes doing his job, hes assembled a fantastic team, Starr said Monday to ABC News. That is a great, great team of complete professionals, so lets let him do his job. There arent any records of political donations from Mueller himself. A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment Monday afternoon about the political donations from his legal team and the criticism some of the team were partisan. Mueller received   praise since taking over the investigation on May 17. But with the investigation ramping up, Trumps legal team is looking for new ways to go on the offensive. In a TV appearance over the weekend, one of Trumps lawyers wouldnt rule out the possibility of firing Mueller. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to reflect the Mueller team spokesman telling CNN that the Dreeben identified in FEC records as a deputy solicitor with the Justice Department who donated to Clinton in 2006 is not the same person working for Mueller."
Senators reach Russia sanctions deal,CNN,Jeremy Herb,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) Senate leaders struck an agreement Monday to roll out additional sanctions on Russia and make it difficult for the President to lift them. The Senate Foreign Relations and Banking Committee announced a deal that had the support of the committees top Democrats and Republicans thats expected to attract wide bipartisan support. The proposal would provide for a congressional review process if the executive branch eases current sanctions on Russia. And it imposes new sanctions in a number of categories, including those conducting malicious cyber activity on behalf of the Russian government and supplying weapons to the Assad regime. The measure would also authorize assistance for European countries concerned about Russian aggression, and require a study on the flow of illicit finance involving Russia and a formal assessment of US economic exposure to Russian   entities. The legislation is expected to be attached as an amendment to an unrelated bill involving sanctions on Iran. Sen. Bob Corker, chairman of the Senate foreign relations committee, had previously been hesitant to take up a Russia sanctions bill in his committee. But he said last month that he wanted to see progress with Russia or else he would move a sanctions measure. Despite mixed signals from the President and his administration this year over sanctions, a senior source on Capitol Hill said the White House is not fighting congressional efforts to push through the measure.  Sen. Ben Cardin, the top Democrat on foreign relations, expressed confidence Monday that Trump would sign off on it. I would be very, very surprised if the President vetoes this bill. Now hes surprised me on a lot of things. But we havent passed a bill, he told reporters. I find as we get to the finish line on these bills, every administration generally joins us. ..so I think well have the support of the administration. Im confident about that. On Tuesday, however, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a Senate committee he is reviewing the proposed sanctions, but is wary of action that could get in the way of the administrations efforts to make inroads with the Russian government on various issues.  What I wouldnt want to do is close the channels off, Tillerson said. He called for flexibility so the administration can turn that heat up when they see fit.  Provisions from the agreement match up with different bills that have already been introduced this year, including two by Cardin, who teamed up with Republican Sens. John McCain and Lindsey Graham. The top members of the Senate banking committee    Republican Sen. Mike Crapo and Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown    were also heavily involved. Trump suggested in January before he was inaugurated that he would be open to lifting sanctions on Russia if they helped the US fight terrorists, though he said hed keep the sanctions in place for at least a period of time. If you get along and if Russia is really helping us, why would anybody have sanctions if somebodys doing some really great things? he said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. The issue saw renewed attention after Yahoo News recently reported that Trump administration officials began developing plans to lift sanctions almost as soon as they took office. Former State Department official Dan Fried, who was quoted in Yahoos story, later clarified to CNN that he did not have   knowledge that the Trump administration would attempt to unilaterally relax Russia sanctions, but did reach out to some members of Congress because he was concerned by rumors he had heard from other officials that there was a possibility. US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley emphasized last week the Trump administration has stood strong on the existing sanctions on Russia. Were going continue to call them out as we need to. At the same time, we are trying to see if we can have talks with them on how to better come in line in the Syrian conflict. Were working with them on  . But if we see Russia doing anything wrong, were going to tell them, she said on CBS Face the Nation."
Friend: Trump is considering firing Mueller,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) One of President Donald Trumps friends said he believes the President is considering dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller, who was appointed to lead the FBI investigation into Russias potential ties to the 2016 election. I think it is a consideration the President has had because Mueller is illegitimate as special counsel, Christopher Ruddy, the CEO of Newsmax Media, told CNNs Chris Cuomo on New Day Tuesday. Chris, remember there is no evidence of wrongdoing, theres no evidence of collusion, theres no evidence of obstruction. He added that he believes it would be a mistake to fire Mueller, but said the the basis of his investigation is  . Ruddy first made the bombshell assertion that Trump was considering dismissing Mueller to PBS Jody Woodruff on PBS Newshour Monday night.  But a source close to the President said Trump is being counseled to steer clear of such a dramatic move like firing the special counsel.  He is being advised by many people not to do it, the source said. And a person familiar with Trumps thinking said Tuesday morning that its unlikely the President will fire Mueller, but conceded that its often difficult to predict Trumps behavior. No one is recommending that, the person said, noting, however, that the option hasnt been ruled out. Regarding Ruddys comments, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said: Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the President regarding this issue. With respect to this subject, only the President or his attorneys are authorized to comment. And deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said simply: Chris speaks for himself. Tuesday morning, in a statement to CNN, Ruddy disputed Spicers comments. Spicer issued a bizarre late night press release that a) doesnt deny my claim the President is considering firing Mueller and b) says I didnt speak to the President about the matter    when I never claimed to have done so. Memo to Sean: focus your efforts on exposing the   Russian allegations against POTUS and highlighting his remarkable achievements! Dont waste time trying to undermine one of your few allies. Ruddy also told CNN Spicer called him last night to ask him to issue a statement saying he didnt speak with Trump personally, but he refused. Asked to respond, Spicer said he called and asked him to clarify that his statement was not based on any meetings or conversations with the president. Reports met with surprise, Mueller was appointed FBI director by President George W. Bush in 2001 and served until 2013, when Comey took over as head. Since being appointed special counsel in May, he has built a team of formidable legal minds whove worked on everything from Watergate to Enron. He has long been widely respected by many in Washington from both sides of the aisle, with many lawmakers praising Deputy Attorney General Rob Rosensteins pick. Still not everyone is a fan. Earlier this week, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich reportedly told radio host John Catsimatidis that Congress should abolish the independent counsel. I think Congress should now intervene and they should abolish the independent counsel, the former House speaker said. Because Comey makes so clear that its the poison fruit of a deliberate manipulation by the FBI director leaking to The New York Times, deliberately set up this particular situation. Its very sick. Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, disputed that report. I dont think Newt said that, Graham told reporters. I think itd be a disaster. Theres no reason to fire Mueller. What had he done to be fired? After news of Ruddys interview surfaced on the web, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, echoed that sentiment on Twitter. If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately   independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller, the California lawmaker tweeted. Dont waste our time. Schiff later told CNNs Anderson Cooper he wouldnt be surprised if Trump was considering ousting Mueller. You have to hope that common sense would prevail, Schiff said. But it wouldnt surprise me at all, even though it would be absolutely astonishing were he (Trump) to entertain this. The echoes of Watergate are getting louder and louder. House Speaker Paul Ryan, however, did say he would be surprised if Trump fired Mueller. I think he should let Bob Mueller do his job, do his job independently, and do his job quickly, because I think that thats what he would want to have happen, Ryan told conservative commentator Guy Benson. Full independence Rosenstein told senators at a Senate appropriations subcommittee hearing Tuesday that Mueller will have the full independence he needs to conduct that investigation. He noted that Mueller can only be fired for good cause, and it would be his job to put that good cause into writing. The chain of command for the special counsel is only directly to the attorney general    and in this case, the acting attorney general, he said.  Rosenstein said no, I have not, when asked by Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat, whether he has seen good cause to fire Mueller.  If there were good cause, I would consider it. If there were not good cause, it would not matter to me what anybody said, he said."
Gillespie ekes out win in surprisingly close GOP Virginia primary,CNN,Miranda Green,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) Ed Gillespie was expected to hold onto a narrow lead to win the Republican nomination for Virginia governor in his partys primary election Tuesday evening, CNN projected. On the Democratic side, Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam is on track to win the nomination for Virginia governor, CNN has projected. Gillespies tight victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chair Corey Stewart came as a major surprise. Observers initially expected it to be an easy win for Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Committee. Frank Wagner, a senator in the commonwealths legislature, trailed in third place. Meanwhile, Northams win capped off fierce competition on the Democratic side, where he faced off against former congressman Tom Perriello. And turnout in the Democratic primary far outpaced the Republican side. In a statement congratulating Northam, outgoing Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe linked the Republican field to President Donald Trump. Tuesdays elections marked the first time both parties held contests on the same day in the commonwealths history. A fierce fight, Stewarts surprise performance came after a campaign during which he engendered significant controversy. Last October, he appeared on a show hosted by Mike Cernovich, a member of the     media who has dismissed the existence of date rape. Two months ago, Stewart participated in an ask me anything session on Reddits largest   forum, where, among other things, he called Gillespie a cuckservative. He had previously served as the Trump campaign chair for Virginia before being fired from the unpaid position. Gillespie, a former George W. Bush aide, campaigned off the goodwill he established with Republicans after his narrow loss to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in 2014. Gillespie worked to tiptoe around the presence of Trump, embracing policies that are popular with Republicans without directly tying his campaign to the President. Gillespie basically ignored his competition, including the   Stewart, and the strategy seemed to work. Most polls showed Gillespie with a   lead before Election Day.  A third candidate, Wagner, struggled to gain traction, despite winning the endorsement of The Washington Posts editorial board. For Democrats, the race had been framed as a reboot of the Bernie   Clinton contest.  Some viewed the close battle as a pitting of the Sanders wing of the party, as channeled by Perriello, against the Clinton wing of the party, represented by Northam. But the comparison was never a perfect fit. Northam had pushed his campaign further to the left and has described Trump as a narcissistic maniac    while Perriello instead attempted to reach out to Trump voters by selling a message of economic populism framed through a progressive perspective. Both the Democratic and Republican contests featured established candidates with lengthy political careers facing off against insurgent, populist candidates hoping to upset the power bases of their respective parties."
Sessions: Russia collusion claim detestable lie,CNN,Stephen Collinson,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions infuriated Democratic senators Tuesday by repeatedly thwarting their efforts to shed light on the firing of James Comey, as he blasted secret innuendo and leaks over his own conduct.  In a fiery Senate intelligence committee hearing, Sessions raised his voice in indignation as he rejected claims that he had colluded with Russian officials during the 2016 election as an appalling and detestable lie. He repeatedly declined to go into his private conversations with President Donald Trump    frustrating Democrats who accused him of stonewalling to shield the administration. Using all the skills in filibustering and diversion that he learned in years as an Alabama senator, the Attorney General appeared to escape the hearing without major political damage. He also provided resistance that may offer a boost to a   White House that has been unable to shrug off the dark cloud over the Russia investigation. Sessions beseeched his former Senate colleagues to believe him when he said he did not hold an undisclosed meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak at a speech by   Trump at the Mayflower Hotel in Washington last year. He said he could not recall if he had an informal interactions with Russians at the event. Sessions defended his decision to participate in the firing of former FBI Director Comey, even though he had recused himself from the Russian matter and Trump later said that the probe was in his mind when he pushed the FBI chief overboard.  I recused myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations, he said. But the attorney general left Democratic senators deeply frustrated when he declined to go into the reasons for Comeys dismissal and wouldnt say whether the President ordered him out of the Oval Office so he could talk privately with Comey on February 14, in an encounter the former FBI director said included a request for him to go easy on former national security adviser Michael Flynn. When asked by Sen. Angus King if the President invoked executive privilege to prevent his testimony, Sessions responded, I am protecting the right of the President to assert it if he chooses and there may be other privileges that could apply in this circumstance. Trump watched Sessions testify aboard Air Force One during about   flight to Milwaukee, an aide told CNN.  After the hearing, Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee suggested to CNNs Wolf Blitzer that Congress could ultimately be prepared to hold Sessions in contempt of Congress in an effort to force him to testify in more detail. Sessions responses triggered an explosion by Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon. I believe the American people have had it with stonewalling, Wyden said. Sessions replied, I am not stonewalling. Im following historic policies of Department of Justice. You dont walk into any committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with president of United States. When Wyden accused him of not answering the questions about Comeys reported remark that his behavior after recusing himself from the Russia probe was problematic, Sessions chuckled and then launched into his most theatrical defense of his actions. This is a secret innuendo being leaked out there about me, and I dont appreciate it, Sessions said, raising his voice. Other Democrats also lost their patience with Sessions. You are not answering questions. You are impeding this investigation, said New Mexico Sen. Martin Heinrich. And California Sen. Dianne Feinstein appeared puzzled by Sessions reasoning for not providing more details. Sessions said that he was not sure what was explicitly in Trumps mind when he decided to fire Comey. But he said that he was unable to say whether he had discussed Comeys handling of the FBI investigation on the principle that his conversations with the President should be kept confidential. Feinstein then asked, How do you view that? Since you discussed his removal, why wouldnt you discuss the reasons? California Sen. Kamala Harris meanwhile again earned a rebuke from committee chairman Burr after interrupting Sessions as he was trying to answer, and the Attorney General played the exchange for all it was worth. Im not able to be rushed this fast, it makes me nervous, Sessions said. Sessions determination to mount a vigorous rebuttal, after Comeys testimony before the committee last week raised questions about the administrations conduct, was clear from the moment he began his opening statement.  He said he did not recall a third meeting with Russian ambassador to the US Sergey Kislyak in the Mayflower hotel in Washington, despite reports that the FBI had been investigating whether such a contact took place. I did not have any private meetings nor recall any private conversations with any Russian official at the Mayflower Hotel,  Sessions told the Senate intelligence committee. Sessions also argued that his recusal from the Russia investigation did not mean that he should be barred from his oversight duties over the FBI, following claims by Democrats that he should have not played a role in Comeys firing. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations, Sessions said. At all times throughout the course of the campaign, the confirmation process, and since becoming attorney general, I have dedicated myself to the highest standards. Sessions confirmed that he had left Comey on his own with Trump in the Oval Office alone on February 14, though declined to say whether he was ordered to do so by the President citing the need to keep his conversations with him private. He also confirmed Comeys testimony that the former FBI chief later told him he was concerned about the meeting, but said he did not say that something improper occurred. Sessions also testified that he had never had any meetings with officials from Russia or anywhere else about interference in the US election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign, Sessions said. The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie. Sessions said he had confidence in special counsel Robert Mueller, and said that his recusal from the Russia probe would stop him taking part in any hypothetical effort to remove him. A friend of Trumps said Monday that the President was considering taking just such a step."
5 things we learned at Jeff Sessions hearing,CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions captivated Washington Tuesday, beating back rumors of a private meeting with Russias ambassador to the US and mounting a defense for President Donald Trump, one week after former FBI Director James Comey artfully unloaded on both men.  Sessions routinely said he would not answer questions regarding his conversations with Trump, but he delivered more than enough answers over two and a half hours of testimony Tuesday afternoon.  Here are the top five things we learned. 1. Sessions shut the door on Kislyak, then he   it, Sessions had one major goal    to protect himself after Comey thrust him into the center of the Russia maelstrom. And he appeared to do that effectively in a strong opening statement, where he slammed the door shut on even the possibility that he had a third meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. I did not have any private meetings, nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. I did not attend any meetings at that event separate, Sessions said. But in the     of   questions, Sessions slowly pried that door open again, by increasingly hedging his answers. Shortly after his opening, Sessions said that if he had talked with Kislyak, It wouldve been certainly, I can assure you, nothing improper, if Id had a conversation with him. And its conceivable that that occurred. I just dont remember it. Later, under an intense grilling from Sen. Kamala Harris    which earned a rebuke from Sen. John McCain    Sessions explained his hedging. Will you let me qualify it? If I dont qualify it youll accuse me of lying. So, I need to be correct as best I can, Sessions said. And Im not able to be rushed this fast, it makes me nervous. 2. Sessions recusal started almost immediately, and left him blind on Russias hacking, The chief law enforcement officer of the United States was never briefed on Russias hacking of one of its major political parties, or any other efforts by Russia to mess with the elections    past and future. Why? Because he personally recused himself from all things related to the Trump campaigns ties to Russia the day after he was sworn into office. What Sessions didnt explain is why he waited a month to tell the public    and his own associates    that he had stepped aside from the probe. Comey testified last week that as of February 14, he still believed Sessions had not recused himself    but that he almost certainly would. In fact, according to Sessions, he had recused himself two weeks earlier. Also, hes not 100% sure that Russia messed with the election, because hes only read news reports about it. 3. Sessions did a strong job protecting Trump, and himself, Its not clear if Sessions intended to pay penance to Trump after their relationship strained over the Presidents concerns that Sessions burned him by stepping aside from the Russia probe    but he did a good job defending the White House anyway. Sessions is now the only Trump official on the record, under oath, countering Comeys testimony last week under oath. In particular, Sessions tamped down Comeys recounting of the February 14 meeting Comey had with Trump    where Trump reportedly asked him stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn. READ: James Comeys prepared testimony, First, Sessions discounted Comeys report that Sessions didnt want to leave the room because he felt like something might be amiss. I left. It didnt seem to me to be a major problem. I knew that Director Comey,   experienced in the Department of Justice, could handle himself well, Sessions told Sen. Marco Rubio. Then Sessions downplayed Comeys request that he never be left in the room alone with Trump again, saying, he gave me no detail about what it was that he was concerned about. Later, Sessions directly blasted Comey for his testimony in private last week, This is a secret innuendo out there being leaked about me    and I dont appreciate it. The White House said Trump thinks Sessions did a very good job in his testimony. In the gaggle on Air Force One on Tuesday, White House deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said the President wasnt able to watch much of it, but from what he did see and what he heard, he thought that attorney general Sessions did a very good job and in particular was very strong on the point that there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign. Sanders confirmed that the President did interview Robert Mueller as a candidate for FBI director the day before he was named special counsel of the federal investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia ties. Sanders would not, however, say whether the President has confidence in Mueller in that role. Beyond that, what I said earlier, I dont have anything more to add, Sanders said, when a reporter asked if Trump has confidence in Mueller. 4. Senate Republicans lined up more with Trump for this hearing, When Comey testified, there was nobody carrying water for the White House on the Senate Russia probe    even though half of the panel is comprised of Senate Republicans. But that changed Tuesday, with a variety of Republicans coming to Sessions (and the White Houses) aide. It could be because they didnt like seeing one of their former colleagues    Sessions was in the Senate 20 years    under the hot glare of the national spotlight. Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who has frequently supported Trump and worked with Sessions when he was in the Senate, offered him a hand, painting a comical portrait of an alleged spy scheme. Have you ever, ever in any of these fantastical situations heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage? An apparent fracture on the committee even emerged when, after Chairman Richard Burr said they were intensely focused on Russian interference in the election, Sen. Jim Risch muttered, doesnt seem like it. 5. Senate investigators arent done with Sessions yet, Warner made clear in his opening remarks they were already planning to bring Sessions in for questioning later this year, well before Sessions offered to appear before them. And lawmakers throughout the hearing pressed Sessions on providing emails and other documents to them. Whats not clear is if Trump will be forced to invoke executive privilege to stop Sessions from testifying again, or from handing over the documents senators requested Tuesday. Sessions cited a Justice Department policy which blocks officials from testifying about private discussions with the President.  (Sen. James Lankford, an Oklahoma Republican, later noted that former Attorney General Eric Holder used that policy to stall Congress investigations of the Obama White House.) Burr made it clear Tuesday that National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers followed through on his promise to the Senate intelligence committee and returned to answer questions in private that he said he could not answer. Sessions would not make that promise Tuesday. But lawmakers arent done with him yet."
Judge orders DOJ to produce Sessions clearance form,CNN,Eli Watkins,6/13/2017,"Washington (CNN) A US District Court judge in Washington gave the Justice Department one month to make public a page of Attorney General Jeff Sessions clearance form, on which he was meant to disclose any contacts with Russian officials. Judge Randolph Moss order came the day before Sessions was due to testify in public before the Senate intelligence committee. The order gave the government until July 12 to produce any documents not subject to a FOIA exemption from the request for the page of Sessions   form, a security clearance questionnaire. The order allows for the Justice Department to consider the legality of producing the form and if the Justice Department can redact the release because of exemptions in federal public records law. The judges decision issued Monday afternoon also gave the Justice Department and the FBI one month to search for any records of White House chief of staff Reince Priebus reported outreach to the FBI requesting the bureau refute reports of communications between Russian officials and members of the Trump campaign. The government has until July 12 to complete a search for any records of Priebus requests to the FBI. Moss ordered a status conference the next day, July 13. The decision came in response to Freedom of Information Act requests from American Oversight, a nonprofit that says it relies on FOIA to investigate the Trump administration. Sessions has come under heavy scrutiny for not saying in his confirmation hearing that he had meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak in the lead up to the 2016 election. After that failure to disclose came to light, Sessions defended himself and sent supplemental testimony to the Senate. CNN reported in May that Sessions omitted any of these meetings from his  . In response to that report, the DOJ insisted the decision not to list the meetings was  . CNN reported last week that former FBI Director James Comey told senators in a closed session that Sessions might have met with Kislyak a third time. American Oversights second request in the judges order Monday stemmed from February reports saying Priebus reached out to Comey and his former deputy, Andrew McCabe, who is now the acting director of the bureau. CNN reported at the time that the FBI denied Priebus request, although White House press secretary Sean Spicer said at the time that the White House was simply asking the FBI to tell the truth in response to reports about Trump campaign communications with Russian officials. Comey did take issue with the February New York Times report during his testimony last week. Comey did not state specifically what he disputed, and The New York Times stood by its story. The White House and FBI did not respond to requests for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment."
Ubisoft Surprises with Mario Crossover Title at E3 Press Conference - Breitbart,Breitbart,Nate Church,6/13/2017,"Ubisofts E3 2017 press conference was an uneven showing of new and old with a few standout titles hogging the spotlight. [First on the stage was Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle. Legendary Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, effusive about Ubisofts passion, said that when he spoke to them regarding the new title, he had one request above all. Rather than recycling the Mario license into another 2D platformer, try to make a Mario game that has never been done before.  It seems the team took that challenge to heart.  Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle is a   tactics game, like a slapstick   starring a mix of Nintendo characters and Ubisofts screeching Rabbids. Im still not certain what marketing department is responsible for these demented rabbits continued existence, but I feel as if they make a strong case for the reinstatement of public floggings. Despite that, the game itself looks great. I should have known better than to doubt the merit of a title which earned Miyamotos personal endorsement. Color me interested. In the words of my editor: Do not doubt   you heathen. https:  .      Noah Dulis (@Marshal_Dov) June 12, 2017,  Next came Ashraf Ismail to introduce Assassins Creed Origins, the first main entry in the series since the release of Assassins Creed Syndicate in 2015. Our taste of Egypt was a cinematic trailer and then approximately 10 seconds of   footage from a camera looking at a dim monitor. The demonstration was jarring and reeked of some sort of unexpected technical difficulty. They promised 30 minutes of gameplay footage once the press conference was over     well get to that later. We had a glimpse of racing title The Crew 2, though no real gameplay was shown. In addition to geographic expansion, the sequel expands into the air and sea. And while it was certainly very pretty, there was little way to know how the game will actually play out when the rubber hits the figurative and digital road. Twisting stunt planes around skyscrapers does look thrilling, but the original The Crew didnt lack ambition either     it just wasnt much fun to play. Hopefully, well get a clearer picture of the game on the show floor. South Park: The Fractured But Whole returned to the show after its unfortunate delay and now officially has a release date of October 17th, 2017. The   RPG looked typically crude and hilarious, and I dont doubt that it will be one of Ubisofts stronger releases for the holiday season. #UbiE3 Is this the first time butt f***ing has been used at an E3 press conference? I mean, besides annual franchise references.     Nate Church @E3 2017 (@Get2Church) June 12, 2017,  After the  ***ing came  ***ing, by way of a VR experience led by Elijah Wood. Transference takes the player on what is pitched as a virtual reality trip into the memory and emotion of a test subject that has had their experiences digitally recorded by a computer. It was difficult to tell exactly what we might expect, but its an adventure that Ubisoft hopes will leave you still [feeling] unsettled even after youve taken off your headset. Transference is due to launch in 2018. After that we took a trip back in time to 2013 with pirate title Skull  Bones which looks similar to Assassins Creed: Black Flag. Ubisoft Singapore has extracted the excellent naval combat for a game that is obvious   for their fans. Skull  Bones is a    piracy game where youll swashbuckle and hoist mainsails alongside friends and enemies, competing for booty while attempting to evade 1720s justice on the end of a cutlass. The game certainly has potential     Black Flags design was just begging for a dedicated pirate adventure     but with boarding that seems to be entirely automated and seemingly little to do beyond multiplayer matches, Skull  Bones has a lot to do to prove it can stand on its own. Im sure well be hearing much more about it on the way to its release in Fall 2018. We left the seas for a brief aside into Just Dance and a South Park mobile game, both given little more than token attention en route to Starlink: Battle for Atlas. Think No Mans Skylanders.  This    hybrid will see you customizing and piloting a transforming ship through various missions both in space and on the planets surface. If you cant find your ideal craft on store shelves, this time around you can simply purchase the digital version. Its another solid idea that will depend on how heavily Ubisoft leans on    customers for more collectible content. Skylanders was notorious for locking just about every corner of every level behind walls that could only be breached by heading to your local toy store. Ubisoft finished their presser in grand fashion with Far Cry 5, which looked absolutely stunning. It doubled down on the series brutal violence, bringing it to fictional Hope County, Montana to the tune of Amazing Grace. Recruitable pets,   characters, and multiplayer   were confirmed as features, as well as some limited form of tactical command over the AI. We will definitely be diving as deep as we can go into this one     but hopefully not climbing too many towers in between. Finally, Beyond Good  Evil 2 was debuted with a massive cinematic trailer that left most in attendance     myself included     with goosebumps. Theres no word on what the game will be, but theyve nailed an epic aesthetic. If nothing else, they did a phenomenal job of whetting appetites for whatever   information is planned next. After the main show, we saw Assassins Creed Origins in full. It was, in a word, devastating. The proposed rejuvenation of the franchise has turned it into a shambling mash of mechanics from Far Cry and Watch Dogs, with an Assassins Creed aesthetic smeared over the same things weve seen countless times before. You are a Medjay, a guardian of Egypt. RPG elements take center stage here, with loot rarities and statistics that will help you advance as you level up. A branching skill tree allows you to specialize in stealth or assault approaches to the massive worlds challenges. Senu, your eagle friend, functions like a Watch Dogs 2 drone. Youll use him to tag enemies in order to see their level, role, and behavior. Meanwhile, your ability to actually assassinate them is almost wholly dependent on your respective level, and crafting is based on the same hunting mechanic weve seen reused in every Far Cry release since Far Cry 3. The game was beautiful and polished but lacked any sense of the lethality present in earlier Assassins Creed titles. Seeing the protagonist drive his hidden blade into the skull of a foe, then that foe turn and charge him because his hidden blade hadnt been crafted to a high enough level did nothing but completely destroy the fantasy around which the franchise was built. If anything, Assassins Creed Origins drives home the point that Ubisoft simply doesnt seem to understand the franchise or its loyal fans. The 30 minute demo felt bloated, unfocused, and more than anything else, like Assassins Creed in name only. Well sit down with each of these titles in the next few days. Im sure that the developers will have a lot to say and that well have even more complete impressions once weve had some time to get our hands dirty. Stay tuned for our ongoing coverage of E3 2017.

Britain and France to Crack Down on Online Terrorist Content - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jack Hadfield,6/13/2017,"Theresa May, the newly   British Prime Minister spoke at a press conference on Tuesday ahead of a visit to meet with the French President Emmanuel Macron, revealing that the two countries would be working together to push a new legal liability on social media and technology companies to remove unacceptable content that is promoted on their platforms. [According to May, Britain and France will be working jointly with internet giants to help them create new methods to automatically remove content judged to be extremist by the two governments. Both leaders are determined to ensure that the internet cannot be a safe space for terrorists. No specific companies were mentioned, but they will probably include the likes of Google, Facebook, and Twitter, who all had already promised to crack down on this material in the wake of the Westminster terror attack back in March. They each continue to highlight that they are working on improvements, and that terrorist content has no place on their platforms.  The Prime Minister said that while the     between British and French intelligence was already strong, more must be done to tackle the terrorist threat online: In the UK we are already working with social media companies to halt the spread of extremist material and poisonous propaganda that is warping young minds       The UK and France will work together to encourage corporations to do more and abide by their social responsibility to step up their efforts to remove harmful content from their networks, including exploring the possibility of creating a new legal liability for tech companies if they fail to remove unacceptable content. We are united in our total condemnation of terrorism and our commitment to stamp out this evil. Yvette Cooper MP, the previous chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, who has in the past criticized social media companies for being slow to react when illegal content was pointed out to them, echoed her points today, applauding the Prime Ministers announcement: Social media companies like YouTube have been getting away with a dangerous and irresponsible approach to extremism for too long. Still today YouTube is showing illegal propaganda videos for banned jihadi and   extremists. They have a disgraceful disregard for the law. The   Home Affairs Select Committee called for a system of fines and stronger legislation. So if that is what the British and French governments are working on now, that is really welcome. They need to make rapid progress, because online radicalisation is a very serious threat, and this problem has been growing for a long time. However, there are already concerns that this approach may be too  . Max Hill QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation for the government, asked if it was absolutely necessary for fines to be imposed due to   explaining that the tech companies regularly   with the police in their investigations, and that the real problem is the sheer bulk of the material.

"U.S. Mining Industry Sees a Resurgence, Citing First Profitable Quarter in Two Years",Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/13/2017,"The U. S. mining industry is starting to see a resurgence. [According to data from the U. S. Census Bureau published last week, the mining industry made a profit for the first time in two years in the first quarter of 2017.  U. S. mining corporations with $50 million or more in assets reported $1. 957 billion in combined profits after taxes from January to March 2017, according to a collection of quarterly financial reports about the mining industry from the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau has been posting these quarterly reports about the mining industry in the U. S. including data about profits and losses after taxes, since the fourth quarter of 2000. In the first quarter of 2016, U. S. mining corporations with $50 million or more in assets cited a collective $27. 075 billion in losses. The U. S. mining industry had not reported profits since the third quarter of 2014 when it cited profits of  $10. 258 billion. The most profitable quarter for the U. S. mining industry in the 16 years the U. S. Census tracked profits and losses for the mining industry was in the third quarter of 2008, when it cited $31. 376 billion in profits. There is more evidence of a resurgence in the mining industry than just the numbers. President Trump spoke about the opening of a new coal mine in the Pittsburgh area that expects to employ around 100 workers as an example of the industrys comeback."

Anti Soros Law? Hungary Tightens Rules On Foreign-Funded NGOs,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/13/2017,"The Hungarian government has passed a new regulatory law on foreign   organisations (NGOs) such as those funded by   billionaire George Soros. The law means tougher rules to make the organisations more transparent. [The new legislation, passed by 130 votes to 44 in the Hungarian parliament, will see   NGOs with an annual revenue of more than 7. 2 million Hungarian forints ($ 20, 000) be made to register as a   organisation.   The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) has expressed outrage at the new law and has already announced plans for civil disobedience the Budapest Business Journal reports. The spokesman for the Hungarian government Zoltan Kovacs defended the new law noting the government had gone to the European Commission for Democracy through Law, also known as the Venice Commission, who had seen no problems with it. The Venice Commission wrote a report on the new law saying it, pursues a prima facie legitimate aim and can be considered to be necessary in a democratic society in the interest of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.  Kovacs also rejected accusations that the law was mimicking a similar law in Russia saying that the Hungarian law does not require NGOs to register as foreign agents and does not take away their public funding. The does, however, force NGOs to say where their funds are coming from and be more transparent. The law is largely seen by many as a continuation of the Hungarian governments crackdown on international NGOs financed by     billionaire George Soros. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has slammed Soros in the past saying that he has agitated within Hungary through NGOs to open the borders for the mass migration of millions into Europe. In a speech at the European Parliament in April, Orban said, George Soros and his NGOs want to transport one million migrants to the EU per year. He has personally, publicly announced this programme and provides a financial loan for it. You could read this yourselves.  The Hungarian government has also passed a law that some have charged as targeting the Central European University (CEU) which was founded by Soros. Orban said that it was unfair for the university to be able to issue U. S. degrees without having a campus in the U. S. as it gave it an advantage over all other Hungarian universities. Hungary joins a growing number of other Eastern European countries who have come out against Soros and his NGO network including establishment figures in Romania, Poland, Serbia, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The Hungarian Civil Liberties Union (TASZ) have said they will plan civil disobedience in reaction to the NGO law saying it goes against the constitution of Hungary itself."
Warriors avenge Finals collapse to win second championship in 3 years with masterful takedown of Cavaliers,Business Insider,Scott Davis,6/13/2017,"The Golden State Warriors avenged their 2016 Finals collapse with   a   win over the Cleveland Cavaliers in Game 5 to win the   2017 championship.     The title marks the Warriors second in three years, and   potentially, the beginning of a dynasty.     After going up   in the series, the Warriors ran into a Cavs   team with perhaps more fight left than anyone expected. Following   a Game 4 trouncing in Cleveland, the Cavs once again gave the   Warriors a test in Game 5, buoyed by the    magic of   LeBron James and Kyrie Irving and some hot shooting from J. R.   Smith.     But in the fourth quarter, leading by five, the Warriors turned   to the man they brought in to get them back over the hump: Kevin   Durant. Durant was nearly flawless in Game 5, scoring 39 points   on   shooting, with seven rebound and five assists.     He wasnt alone, of course. Stephen Curry chipped in 34 points on     shooting with six rebounds and 10 assists. The Warriors   also got a huge game from Andre Iguodala off the bench, as he   contributed 20 points in 38 minutes and dutifully locked down   Irving and James.      In the process, the Warriors may be looking at the beginning of a   dynasty. They face a big offseason, with the free agencies of   Durant, Curry, Iguodala, and Shaun Livingston. But Durant is   reportedly willing to take less than the max to   with the   Warriors. In doing so, the Warriors will not need cap space to     Iguodala and Livingston. And Curry, after years of being   underpaid, will be eligible of a max contract worth approximately   $205 million over five years.     The Warriors have a core of four   stars, in their primes,   eligible to be locked up long term. Odds are, this is not the   last we see of them.  The Golden State Warriors avenged their 2016. .."

The Next Revolution? Steve Hilton is the Original RINO,Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,6/13/2017,"The chairman of Britains oldest conservative think tank has slammed political strategist turned media pundit Steve Hilton for portraying himself as a Tea Party style   figure, accusing him of being a liberal moderniser and RINO (Republican in name only). [Speaking to Breitbart London Editor in Chief Raheem Kassam on Breitbart News Daily, Bow Group Chairman Ben   said Fox Newss new anchor Steve Hilton and his show The Next Revolution, with its focus on how corrupt the establishment is was far from a friend of the people.  Explaining how Hilton has contributed to the collapse of Conservative grassroots in the United Kingdom before jumping ship to the U. S. to become a media pundit,   said of Hilton and his long association with Britains former prime minister: Steve Hilton was really the original moderniser in the Conservative party       the original RINO. He worked with David Cameron going back 20, 25 years       came up with him through the ranks of the Conservative party. Their whole basis was to move the Conservative Party leftwards to the centre, to ape what [Labour Party Prime Minister] Tony Blair had done in British politics. It is extraordinary to now see him almost placing himself with the Tea Party movement in the United States. Listing the disastrous and unconservative policies pushed by Hilton in the UK, Kassam said: Let us not forget this man is somebody who was behind implementing the big green agenda in the United Kingdom, he was behind telling Conservative Members of Parliament that they could no longer espouse conservative views and that they had to hide behind these liberal left approaches to things. His big flagship policy was what they called the big society which really meant big government, and using fluffy   words to implement it.  Both Bow Group Chairman   and Breitbart host Kassam agreed they were glad Hilton had suddenly performed a   and decided his decades of progressive politicking was a mistake as he looked to populism for a new career, but they also said it was time to hear him admit he had been wrong.   said: Everyone can change their views in politics, everyone can change their opinions. But what Id like to hear from Steve Hilton is an address as to how he was wrong and why we were right. How did he change his views and why? Kassam went further, demanding Hilton apologise to the public for the damage he had done. He said: Id like to have him look squarely down that Fox News camera and say: Im sorry for ruining the United Kingdom, Im sorry for ruining the Conservative Party       Im sorry for continuing the legacy of Tony Blair       I see one of my fellow countrymen masquerading as something that for so many years he was against. He was ridiculing us, he was mocking us.    remarked in reply that not only had Hilton and his fellow travellers damaged conservatism in Britain, they had also attacked those who sought to defend the old principles of the movement, including his own think tank which had been known as a favourite of former Prime Minister Baroness Margaret Thatcher. Explaining how that damage led to the disastrous result for the Conservative Party in last weeks general election,   remarked: They took a very uncompromising attitude towards those who continued to defend   conservatism. David Cameron personally tried to wipe both myself and the Bow Group out, and what happened with Steve Hilton and David Cameron was to totally disempower the grassroots membership, who tended to stick to traditional conservative values. All of that has actually led to the general election we just saw because the Conservative Party now has one sixth of the membership of the Labour Party because everyone got extremely annoyed that the leadership of the party held the membership in contempt, and left. That legacy is still having a major effect on British politics. Im glad Steve Hilton has admitted hes wrong, but he seems to want to rewrite that history. Steve Hilton worked with the Conservative Party on their failed 1997 general election campaign before becoming the director of strategy     known as the   man     to former British Prime Minister David Cameron, resigning in 2012.

LGBT Magazine Accuses Breitbart of Homophobia for Criticizing #ResistMarch - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/13/2017,"The Advocate     a magazine that covers lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer affairs (LGBTQ)     has accused Breitbart News of homophobia for running critical coverage and analysis of Sundays ResistMarch in Los Angeles. [The march is traditionally known as the Gay Pride parade, but it was changed to the #ResistMarch this year as an expression of opposition to President Donald Trump.  Breitbart News published three articles about the parade: L. A.    #ResistMarch Feels the Hate for Trump L. A. #ResistMarch: The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended and Trump Walk of Fame Star Vandalized During L. A. Gay Pride Resist March.  According to the Advocates Trudy Ring, Breitbart News is guilty of homophobia (that is, the irrational fear of homosexuals and homosexuality) for making the argument that the LGBT rights movement used to be OK but has descended into   insanity.  Notably, Ring and the Advocate do not link to any of Breitbart News articles about the march, so that its readers might decide for themselves. She writes: The   site, one of several we monitor so you, Advocate readers, dont have to, is going so far as to call Sunday The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended.  Breitbart, which claims not to embrace homophobia (that claim is questionable, and it certainly is full of transphobia) is basically making the argument that the LGBT rights movement used to be OK but has descended into   insanity. Actually, its doubtful that the people behind Breitbart would have embraced the Stonewall protesters, many of whom were transgender women of color and far from wealthy, or any LGBT movement with a shred of diversity or an ounce of backbone. The article reminds us of some people who today find Martin Luther King Jr. far more acceptable than current civil rights activists but would have demonized him as a dangerous radical in the 1960s.

The tech stock fairy tale is heading for a bad ending,Business Insider,Joe Ciolli,6/13/2017,"Tech giveth, and tech taketh away.     And the formerly   sector has been doing quite a bit of   taking over the past two days.     The Nasdaq 100 Index, which is heavily weighted toward tech, has   slipped 3% since Friday, erasing roughly $200 million of market   value amid mounting concerns that the space got overheated on its   way to record highs.     The jarring   has highlighted the fragility of a tech   rally driven largely by a handful of     stocks   that are more  than at any other   point in the   bull market. That includes the     FANG stocks     Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Google     and others,   like .     The sectors swift fall from grace also shows just how perfect   the conditions were that led to its   dominance       conditions that, when unwound, can wreak havoc not just on the   elite few companies leading the rally but also on those clinging   to their coattails.     Just like in the fairy tale, this perfect scenario is unlikely   to last, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist, David   Kostin, wrote in a client note on Friday.     Hes describing the ideal conditions that drove a 21%      gain for the Nasdaq 100 through last Thursday. While   profit growth has shown signs of strength, economic conditions   have stayed subdued enough to keep potentially runaway valuations   in check, Kostin said.     That harmony was disrupted Friday when Robert Boroujerdi, the   head of global securities research at Goldman, published a report    around Facebook, Apple, Amazon,   Microsoft, and Google. The realized volatility for the group of   stocks is lower than that of the broader market, which may be   giving investors the false impression that risks are subdued, he   said.     As many traders found out the hard way on Friday, risks are very   much alive and well, even for seemingly unassailable stocks like   Apple. The tech giant has slipped 6. 2% since Friday amid a report   from Bloomberg that the coming iPhone 8 . The companys woes   continued Monday after Mizuho analyst Abhey Lamba  on the stock to a hold, citing   limited upside.     The rash of weakness across the tech sector shows just how   precarious sharp shares gains can be and how quickly they can go   south. That dynamic is amplified when a trade is crowded, as     tech was heading into Fridays reckoning.     Facebook, Amazon, Google, and Apple represent four of the six   stocks most frequently found in the top 10 holdings for hedge   funds, according to an analysis conducted by Goldman, which   looked at 821 hedge funds holding a combined $1. 9 trillion in   gross equity positions.     Tech bears will also point to elevated valuations as a reason for   the sectors  . After all, the ratio of enterprise value   to sales is the highest since the   bubble when compared   with the benchmark.     But . Bulls will point to the more traditional      ratio, which remains low relative to history   for both the tech sector and the broader S&P 500.     Regardless of which metric gives a superior reading, investors on   Friday elected to immediately pull money out of tech stocks and   ask questions later.     The SPDR Tech Select Sector ETF, which tracks tech companies in   the S&P 500, saw a $560 million outflow on Friday, the   biggest   removal since January 30, according to   Bloomberg data. The trailing   outflow amounted to $737   million, which was the biggest weekly figure since the early   2016.        The recent market action has left Morgan Stanley unworried. In   fact, the firm wasnt caught   at all by the sudden   weakness in tech, and it expects matters to worsen in the short   term.     We think this was way overdue given the extreme outperformance   and positioning in technology shares, a group of analysts led by   Michael J. Wilson wrote in a client note on Monday. We dont   think its over and expect some   this week.     Wilson, however, highlights the sectors torrid earnings growth,   which is among the best in the S&P 500. Tech companies in the   benchmark saw 21% profit expansion in the first quarter, the best   of any group, according to Bloomberg data. Its expected to see   14% earnings growth in the second quarter, almost double that of   the S&P 500.     Morgan Stanley is also encouraged by the resilience of the   S&P 500, which has slipped only slightly while the Nasdaq 100   has experienced much deeper losses. The firm has a   price   target of 2, 700 for the S&P 500, which would be an 11%   increase from Fridays close.     The fact that the Nasdaq could sell off 2 percent but leave the   broader S&P 500 essentially flat is a good sign that money is   not leaving equities, but simply repositioning, Wilson said. In   our view, that is supportive of our view that this is a   correction not the end of the bull market.     Tech giveth, and tech taketh away. And the. .."
Sony Lets Exclusives and Gameplay Speak for Themselves at E3 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Nate Church,6/13/2017,"Sony showed up to E3 with all of the expected fanfare and a meaty serving of footage from a rich library of upcoming exclusives. [From the opening notes of a band playing in front of a waterfall backlit with hypnotic patterns, we were thrust directly into a showcase of the madcap   to the masterpiece that was last years Uncharted 4. Uncharted: Lost Legacy casts you as the most fascinating character in the Uncharted universe       Chloe, who is less interested in museums and the wonder of discovery than lining her pockets with gold. There is every indication that this   will be as gorgeous and engaging as weve come to expect from developer Naughty Dog, and it is easily one of the games in which I am most confident. Its strong showing was no surprise.  From there, we swept into the bitter wastes of Horizon: Zero Dawn     Frozen Wilds, an expansion to the   stone age of Sonys hit     title. The cinematic trailer offered few details, save for a confirmation of main character Aloys return, and clear evidence that it will be as beautiful and epic as the first. If theyve tightened up some of the more repetitive   gameplay from the previous entry, we could very well be looking at a title with the sort of polish that was originally promised. Then zombies descended from the ceiling, as we were treated to footage of a game that just seems to get better every single time I see it. Days Gone looks like a simulator of The Walking Dead favorite Darryl Dixons life in the zombie apocalypse. In a world overrun by the walking     and running, and leaping, and screaming     dead, you are exactly the sort of   badass that whats left of humanity requires. We watched our protagonist creep toward a group of bandits to save one of his friends, setting explosives to unleash a horde of zombies (called Freakers) on their camp, before a truncated negotiation with their leader in his makeshift tree fort. Everything about this game screams with potential, but well have to reserve judgment until we get a chance to actually sit down and play. PlayStation will also get Shadow of the Colossus and Monster Hunter brought into the current generation. Shadow of the Colossus gets a comprehensive remake that could have been     and was, on social media     easily mistaken for a sequel. Monster Hunter looks to bring all of the franchise staples into glorious HD, with the typical variety of crafting, stalking your prey, and then frantically running away to keep it from eating you alive in tow. After that, we were formally introduced to Marvel Vs. Capcom Infinite, clearly taking some cues from the   of storytelling to create a compelling   experience. Unfortunately, as visuals improve, the differences in design between the comic book and classic video game worlds become garish. Mega Man looked like a poorly designed fan mod in comparison to Strider, who still lacked the same level of detail present in any of Marvels heroes and villains. The plot is appropriately ludicrous, however, and with any luck will help to legitimize the bluntly wacky differences between the two licenses. We caught a glimpse of Call of Duty: WWII with a bit of multiplayer footage, but well have more about that in the coming days after getting our hands on it. Suffice to say it was very pretty, but very obviously sticking to the staples of a   Warfare franchise. The next focal point was VR, and here the offerings on screen became a bit uneven. Skyrim VR looks like fun, but weve been playing the same Elder Scrolls game over and over since 2011. Star Child was an aggressively mediocre platformer that failed to offer any reason to experience it in VR. Id love to be proven wrong, and Ill be sure to say so if I find out differently on the show floor. Meanwhile, both The Inpatient and Monster of the Deep looked promising. I was particularly impressed by Inpatients horrific visuals, recalling the most recent Resident Evil title more than anything else. Being treated like a mental patient will never not be unsettling. Bravo Team was essentially CounterStrike in virtual reality, and Moss was a positively adorable adventure, manipulating the environment as a ghostly guardian entity to enable a   rodent protagonist to complete his quest. The show wrapped with its most anticipated titles. Dad God of War looks brilliant, though Id like to see a little more than   from the legendary Kratos. His son seems inoffensive as a character, but   AI can easily grow tiresome. Well have to wait and see whether hes an asset or detriment to the journey. Detroit: Become Human is a little bit Watch Dogs, a little bit Deus Ex, and a little bit HBOs Westworld. I was disappointed to see that the more interesting female character featured when the game was first revealed in 2015 has seemingly been replaced by a   crew cut with two different colored eyes, but only because he seemed to lack any real sense of identity. Im hoping that the game takes advantage of its   narrative to flesh him out into someone with a personality. Regardless, Im excited to lead my own android revolution. Destiny 2 continues to look solid, with little glimpses into the story and a focus on the exclusive content for owners of the PlayStation 4 version of the game. There wasnt much to tell from the footage, except for some time spent with what is presumably the primary antagonist. He is a typically brutish   humanoid alien bent on domination     but we werent exactly expecting the unexpected in developer Bungies next   outing. Finally, Insomniacs   debuted some extended gameplay that was, quite frankly, very short on actual gameplay. The snippet was predominantly a set of scripted sequences and quicktime events and felt a lot less like playing   than watching him, with occasional breaks for mashing wildly on a button when prompted. It also failed to give any real indication of how the web swinging was going to be handled     something that diehard   2 fans have been wondering since the games announcement. Im really hoping to get some quality time with our friendly neighborhood   on the show floor so I can get some sense of whether developer Insomniac intends to give us an experience worthy of the eponymous webhead. Well look deeper into each title on the floor and give you a clearer verdict on each individual experience in Breitbarts 2017 coverage of the Electronics Entertainment Expo.

"Welfare Fraudsters Allegedly Steal $287,000 from PA Government, Some Using Food Stamps to Buy Heroin - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/13/2017,"Several people in Pennsylvania were charged with allegedly stealing a total of $287, 000 worth of welfare benefits in April, with some of the benefits being used to buy heroin, according to Pennsylvanias Office of the Inspector General. [The Office of the Inspector General expects to recover a total of $287, 659 from the charges filed, mostly from food stamp fraud, Lehigh Valley Live reported.  The alleged fraudsters stole $187, 241 in Supplemental Nutrition Assistant Program benefits, $46, 494 in subsidized day care, $37, 052 in   benefits such as Medicaid, $11, 348 in monetary assistance, and $5, 523 in the Low Income Energy Assistance Program. Aprils cases range from SNAP benefits trafficking in exchange for cash to buy heroin in Williamsport to $52, 909 in combined SNAP, medical assistance and LIHEAP fraud in Warren County (Pennsylvania), Inspector General Bruce R. Beemer said in a statement. Our investigators are zealous in pursuing all cases, regardless of the amount, because its taxpayer money and stopping fraud means making those benefits available to Pennsylvanians who truly need them, Beemer added. Seven people are facing felony charges for the alleged fraud. If convicted, they face a maximum penalty of seven years behind bars, restitution, and a $15, 000 fine. Six people are facing   misdemeanor charges, which carry penalties of up to five years in prison, restitution, and a $10, 000 fine. One person was charged with a   misdemeanor, which carries a maximum penalty of two years in prison, restitution, and a $5, 000 fine. Several states are introducing measures to combat welfare fraud by introducing work requirements to receive benefits. In Georgia, the state required all food stamp recipients to work, receive job training, or volunteer for a   charity for at least 20 hours a week.   percent of people dropped off the food stamp rolls as a result. After Alabama had reinstated work requirements to receive benefits such as food stamps, the state found an 85 percent reduction in the number of people enrolled in the food stamp program."
Rep. Barbara Lee: I Dont Agree with States Rights Because Trump Does - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/13/2017,"Rep. Barbara Lee ( ) said on Tuesday that she does not agree with states rights because President Donald Trump believes in restoring states authority on a wide range of issues, including education and health care insurance markets. [Lee made the remarks at the   Center for American Progress in Washington, DC, where she referenced states rights as it applies to Trumps decision this month to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate change agreement, a move she claims would hurt the U. S. economy.  Moreover, Lee said, California is still committed to fighting global warming. Pulling out of the Paris Accord is also a job killer, Lee said. Because the energy sector     the green sector     coming from California were doing a lot of things     I think some other states will follow. Because the jobs that are being created will be destroyed now as a result of what this president has done, Lee said. I dont agree with states rights because that is kind of this administrations push but in some instances when we have to just go at it on our own     we need to go at it on our own, Lee said. But according to Robertson Williams, a professor at the University of Maryland and director of academic programs for Resources for the Future, a   group that studied the climate change agreement, it is difficult to know exactly what the economic impacts of withdrawing will be. Williams was interviewed by the Boston public radio station in May where he was asked about the economic impact of leaving the agreement. One of the problems we have, were much better at modeling the cost of doing something to reduce emissions than we are modeling the cost of doing nothing, Williams said. We dont know very well how other countries are gonna react. If other countries react by doing less to fight climate change, that has very real costs, Williams said. That unchecked climate change could have very serious costs for the U. S. economy. But knowing exactly how big that is is really hard, Williams said."
Schiff Threatens to Violate Constitution--Twice--with Independent Counsel,Breitbart,Ken Klukowski,6/13/2017,"Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) threatened to have Congress appoint a special counsel, despite the Supreme Courts decision that it is unconstitutional for Congress to appoint any federal official. This decision came from a case so famous that the lawmaker almost certainly learned it as a student at Harvard Law School. [Schiff tweeted Monday, If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately   independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Dont waste our time:  If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately   independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Dont waste our time.     Adam Schiff (@RepAdamSchiff) June 12, 2017,  The Harvard Law professors who taught the ranking member of the House Select Intelligence Committee are probably disappointed with their former student because the Supreme Court in 1976 unanimously said Congress would violate the Constitution by doing so. In the 1970s, Congress created the Federal Election Commission (FEC) which gave them the power to appoint two of its six commissioners, but the statute was challenged on several constitutional grounds. In Buckley v. Valeo, the Supreme Court ruled that the Constitutions separation of powers requires that the only branch of government that can create a federal office   Congress, through passing legislation   is also the one branch that can never then appoint someone to fill the office it had just created. Congress must, instead, specify in the statute who can appoint someone to fill that office, choosing between the president, one of the presidents senior subordinates, such as the attorney general or other cabinet officers, or the courts. Quoting the rule from its 1926 case, Myers v. United States, the Court declared, Legislative power, as distinguished from executive power, is the authority to make laws, but not to enforce them or appoint the agents charged with the duty of such enforcement.  Consequently, the Court in Buckley struck down that provision in federal law for violating the Constitutions Appointments Clause. Following that decision, all FEC commissioners are nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. That is precisely the issue here. Schiff is threatening to take action that the Supreme Court has clearly and repeatedly held unconstitutional. This sets aside the fact that the independent counsel statute   the Ethics in Government Act of 1978   is unconstitutional, upheld by the Supreme Court in its 1988 case, Morrison v. Olson, over the dissent of Justice Antonin Scalia. But political dramas in subsequent years proved Scalias argument correct on why a prosecutor, fully independent from the elected head of the executive branch, is incompatible with the Constitutions structure of American government. Now, many leading liberal judges agree that while the Constitution allows special counsels, it does not allow independent counsels. In other words, Schiff is threatening to violate the Constitution not once, but twice, one in open defiance of the Supreme Court. This is all political theatre. Given these Supreme Court cases, Congress would never pass such a statute. If it did, President Trump would promptly and properly veto it, and there is zero chance that even a   Congress could muster a   supermajority to override the veto. Schiff should know all this, leading skeptics to conclude his entire threat should be chalked up as more evidence of Democrats exacerbation of partisan tensions in the nations capital.

Rodman hopes to do something pretty positive in North Korea,CNN,Matt Rivers,6/13/2017,"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman told CNN he was hoping to do something thats pretty positive, before he boarded a plane bound for North Korea. The eccentric former basketball player arrived in Pyongyang Tuesday afternoon for an anticipated   visit. The trip comes at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Pyongyang. When Rodman landed, four Americans were being detained in North Korea. When asked if he planned to raise their detention with North Korean officials, Rodman said: Well thats not my purpose right now. .. My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea. Hours after his arrival, it was announced that American student Otto Warmbier had been released after more than 17 months in detention. A US national security spokesman, Michael Anton, told CNN there is no connection between Rodmans visit and Warmbiers release. Anton said Rodman was not acting as a representative of the US government or President Donald Trump and stated that he does not believe the President has spoken to Rodman since he entered office. A State Department source also told CNN that Rodman had nothing to do with Warmbiers release. Rodman, a former contestant on Donald Trumps   reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice, is one of the few Americans to have met current North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. Rodman promoted his past visits as a form of informal basketball diplomacy, using sports and as a way to bridge divides, said Daniel Pinkston, a professor of International Relations at Troy University in Seoul.  We all have specialties, but Dennis does have a view about human beings and the natural state of affairs . .. his view seems to me is that if people will talk and interact and if theres dialogue and exchanges and interactions, this process will naturally lead to  Pinkston told CNN.  Surrounded by media at Beijing airport, Rodman didnt respond to CNNs questions about whether he would be meeting Kim during this trip, and wouldnt say if he was delivering a message from the US President to Pyongyang. When asked if he had spoken to Trump at all, Rodman said, Im pretty sure hes happy at the fact that Im over here trying to accomplish something that we both need.  What that is exactly is unclear but at Beijings airport on Monday and Tuesday, Rodman was wearing a black   with the logo of Potcoin    a digital currency for the cannabis industry, according to its website.  RELATED: Potcoin stock rising after Rodman sponsorship, Rodman later tweeted: Im back! Thanks to my sponsor. Basketball diplomacy, Rodman has visited the country at least four times, with three of the visits taking place between 2013 and 2014. A senior US official said the State Department was aware Rodman was planning to travel to North Korea, but stressed he is not there in any official capacity.   His last visit came in January 2014, when Rodman and a group of other former NBA players took part in an exhibition basketball game. It was supposedly a birthday gift for Kim whos said to be a big basketball fan.  Rodman was filmed leading a   of Happy Birthday to the North Korean leader, a man he calls a friend and a very good guy, but is widely seen as a brutal dictator who once lauded the execution of his own uncle. Rodman defended the trip for Kims birthday in a CNN interview saying it was a great idea for the world. Im sorry for whats going on in North Korea, the certain situations, Rodman told CNN after returning from Pyongyang in 2014, but he didnt specify what exactly those situations were and wasnt contrite about the visit itself. That trip generated a string of negative headlines and an outburst from Rodman during the CNN interview. He was heavily criticized in the US for not bringing up the case of Kenneth Bae, an American imprisoned on charges of hostile acts who spent 735 days in North Korean custody before being released in 2014.   prison camps, Rodman maintained then that he wasnt a diplomat, and it wasnt his job to talk about Bae. But once he was released, Bae thanked Rodman for the rant on CNN, claiming it brought attention to his case.  The former basketball star was also accused of ignoring North Koreas human rights record. Pyongyang has reportedly imprisoned more than 100, 000 of its own people in draconian,   prison camps and spends millions on its military programs instead of its impoverished population.  This time around, four Americans are being held in North Korea, including Kim Sang Duk and Kim   two academics who worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier and businessman Kim Dong Chul. The latest visit, Rodmans visit to Pyongyang is his first since Trump, a man with whom he has a personal relationship, took office. Before entering politics, Trump praised one of Rodmans 2013 trips to North Korea in an interview with Fox News. Rodman, who appeared on Trumps reality TV show in 2009 and again in 2013, went on to endorse Trumps candidacy in 2015. But relations between Pyongyang and Washington were considerably less tense in 2013 than they have been in recent months. North Korea has conducted 10 missile tests this year. Experts say each launch gets the country closer to its stated goal of developing a   weapon capable of reaching the United States.  North Korea believes its missile program is the only way to deter Washington from trying to overthrow the Kim regime.  US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denied that charge last month, saying the US is only seeking denuclearization, but the Trump White House has publicly abandoned the   strategy of strategic patience.  Trump weighed in on Twitter last month that North Korea is looking for trouble and urged China to help. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U. S. A. he added.  The Worm and the dictator, Kims passion for basketball was likely inherited from his father, Kim Jong Il, and has been a rare area of common ground for the two nations.  Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, brought the older Kim a basketball autographed by Michael Jordan during a visit in 2000. Nicknamed the Worm, Rodman won two championships with the Detroit Pistons and three with the Chicago Bulls. On the court he was known for his ferocious defense and rebounding ability. But he grabbed just as much attention off the court for his piercings,   hair and   antics. On his first trip to North Korea, Rodman was accompanied by members of the Harlem Globetrotters and a crew from VICE News. RELATED: Dennis Rodman Fast Facts  I come in peace. I love the people of North Korea! Rodman said on Twitter as he arrived. The group traveled for a basketball exhibition that pitted the Americans against North Koreans. Though the game ended in a   tie, all eyes were on the jarring sight of the rebellious    ball player sitting next to the the short,   dictator in a Mao suit. Rodman told Kim he has a friend for life. The purposes of Rodmans visits to North Korea have never been fully transparent. Hes claimed some were about trying to use basketball to bridge the divide between the two countries. But another was strictly about the game and for the love of basketball."
Comatose Otto Warmbier lands in US after release by North Korea,CNN,Will Ripley,6/13/2017,"Pyongyang, North Korea (CNN) American college student Otto Warmbier has landed back in the United States after more than 17 months in detention in North Korea.  Warmbier has been in a coma for over a year, according to his parents, and will be rushed to the University of Cincinnati Medical Center late Tuesday, a hospital spokeswoman said.  His return to the US comes as questions swirl about his health and what happened to him while he was detained by the North Korean government. The    contracted botulism last year and is in bad shape, a source close to the family told CNN. North Korea told a US official that Warmbier contracted botulism and slipped into the coma after taking a sleeping pill, a senior State Department official told CNN.  Otto has left North Korea. He is on Medivac flight on his way home. Sadly, he is in a coma and we have been told he has been in that condition since March of 2016. We learned of this only one week ago, said Fred and Cindy Warmbier in a statement.  We want the world to know how we and our son have been brutalized and terrorized by the pariah regime in North Korean. We are so grateful that he will finally be with people who love him. Warmbier was detained in January 2016 at the airport in Pyongyang while on his way home. His parents say the University of Virginia student had been on a tour of the reclusive country. North Korean authorities said they had security footage of him trying to steal a banner containing a political slogan that was hanging from the walls of his Pyongyang hotel. That was used as evidence in his   trial, during which North Korea accused him of committing hostile acts against the regime at the urging of a purported member of a church in his home state of Ohio, a secretive university organization and the CIA. Warmbier was found guilty and sentenced in March 2016 to 15 years hard labor. It was the last time he was seen publicly. North Korea: Warmbier contracted botulism, Warmbier was one of four Americans detained in North Korea. Since last March, the US had been pressing North Korea to let Swedish officials see the four Americans, the senior State Department official told CNN. When the Swedes finally got the okay to visit, the North Koreans immediately asked for a meeting with Joe Yun, the US envoy in New York, when he was told about Otto Warmbiers condition.  In that meeting about a week ago, Yun was told that Warmbier had contracted botulism a year ago and went into a coma after taking a sleeping pill. US officials then urged those with the ability to persuade Pyongyang to ratchet up the pressure to get him released, said a source, who is familiar with the governments efforts. A second senior State Department official said the US has not yet accepted the North Korean version of events in terms of the timing and cause of how Warmbier fell into a coma. All we know so far is what they have told us, the official said. This is the North Korean version of events. We wont know anything for sure until doctors are able to fully evaluate Ottos condition.  Three other Americans, Two of the three other Americans being held in North Korea, Kim Sang Duk and Kim   are academics who worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology. The third is a businessman named Kim Dong Chul. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the United States is discussing their respective cases with the North Korean regime. The United States does not have a diplomatic mission in North Korea. Its a delicate matter, he said. Were working on it. But their fates have been hanging in the balance as Pyongyang and Washington have seen relations get testier in recent months.  North Korea has fired 16 missiles in 10 tests this year. Experts say each launch gets the country closer to its stated goal of developing a   weapon capable of reaching the United States. North Korea believes its missile program is the only way to deter Washington from trying to overthrow the regime of Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. No connection to Rodman visit, Ottos detainment and sentence was unnecessary and appalling, and North Korea should be universally condemned for its abhorrent behavior. Otto should have been released from the start, said US Sen. Rob Portman, who represents Warmbiers home state of Ohio. Fred, Cindy, and the Warmbier family have been remarkably strong throughout this ordeal. Over the last 18 months, they have had to endure more than any family should have to bear. The news of Warmbiers release comes the same day as basketball star Dennis Rodman arrived in Pyongyang for an expected   visit. But there is no connection between the two events, US National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said. Rodman isnt representing the US government or serving as President Donald Trumps emissary, Anton said. When asked if he would bring up the cases of Warmbier and three other Americans detained in North Korea, Rodman told reporters, thats not my purpose right now . .. My purpose is to go over there and try to see if I can keep bringing sports to North Korea. Rodman had nothing to do with the students release, said the source familiar with the governments efforts to free Warmbier. Weve needed to talk about Otto Warmbier appeared emotional at a news conference organized by the North Koreans before his trial in March 2016. He tearfully confessed to being lured by the United States administration to commit a crime in this country.  Its not clear if he was forced to speak by the North Koreans. His case largely stayed quiet after that until May of this year, when his parents decided it was time to speak out. When they spoke to CNN on May 3, they said they had not seen or heard from Otto since his supposed confession.  With tensions as high as they are, we felt that we needed to talk about Otto and put a face on the person, Cindy Warmbier said. Despite the increasingly hostile   Korean relationship, the Warmbiers said they were encouraged by US President Donald Trumps willingness to improve relations with North Korea.  Im excited for him to be back Emmett Saulnier, Warmbiers former college roommate, said he got a brief phone call from Warmbiers father early Tuesday to let him know the younger Warmbier was coming home, and he had been in a coma since last March. Saulnier immediately called some of their closest friends.  Saulnier and Warmbier met the summer before their freshman year at Virginia. The two bonded over their Ohio roots, and later lived together their junior year, when Warmbier was detained, Saulnier said.

"Playwright Tony Kushner Defends Assassination of Trump in Julius Caesar, Falsely Blames Breitbart for Outrage",Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/13/2017,"Pulitzer   playwright Tony Kushner defended the onstage assassination of a Donald   Julius Caesar in the Public Theaters contemporary iteration of the play, telling the New York Times in an interview that the Shakespeare classic is supposed to be upsetting. [The Oskar   Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar     a modern take on the play in which the main character is dressed to look like the president, and which includes references to tweeting     opened Monday night to a standing ovation from an enthusiastic audience, according to Variety.  But the play has generated controversy over the Caesar characters close resemblance to Trump. Some critics have said that the mock assassination of the Trump       in a graphic scene filmed and published by Inside Edition last week     crossed the line, particularly after another artwork depicting Trumps death, a beheading photograph featuring comedian Kathy Griffin, stirred outrage last month. In response to the controversy, Public Theater sponsors Bank of America and Delta Air Lines pulled their support, while American Express clarified that its funding did not go directly toward Shakespeare in the Park and that it did not condone the theaters interpretation of Julius Caesar. Ironically, the companies withdrawal of support set off another round of outrage, this time from some celebrities and theater figures, including from Kushner, the   Angels in America playwright. Its an upsetting play, but if theres a production of Julius Caesar that doesnt upset you, youre sitting through a very bad production, Kushner told the New York Times. Its clear that the corporate sponsors who pulled out are just being cowardly and caving in to a lot of cranky   people because Breitbart and Fox News told them to.  Kushner wasnt the only person to blame Breitbart and other conservative media for the sponsors withdrawal in their article for the New York Times about the timeline of the controversy, writers Michael Paulson and Sopan Deb accused Breitbart of having driven a campaign on social media against the Public [Theater] that prompted the sponsors to make their decision. Of course, Breitbart News had simply reported on the controversy, and never led a campaign on social media against the play. Early stories about the play centered on one theatergoerss reaction to the graphic assassination scene, while stories about the corporate sponsors pulling out simply reported on the statements that each had made. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Times failed to accurately report on what appeared to be the real reason for the backlash over the play that the level of vitriol against Trump has reached a heightened new level in recent weeks, and that it has now become acceptable to make jokes or art about the assassination of President Trump, and to be celebrated for doing so by theater critics, celebrities and the media."
DHS Shuts Down Anti-Deportation Office - Breitbart,Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/13/2017,"President Donald Trumps Department of Homeland Security has   an   program to have 21   agency officials cooperate with     groups. [The [21 officials] job was to go meet politicians, Congress people, advocate groups, and local law enforcement, complained Sarah Saldaa, a top DHS official from 2014 to early 2017.  Let them see you as a person, as opposed to big, bad ICE, said Saldana, who created the cooperation program when she ran DHSs U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement division from 2014 to 2017.  Trumps DHS executives really are taking away the [21 officials] ability to go out in the community and do what it is that we were hoping they would get done, Saldaa told Foreign Policy magazine. The we in her comment refers to the Democratic Party, which replaced by the   Trump administration on January 20. The 21 employees assigned to the program have now been assigned to Trumps new Victims of Immigration Crime Engagement (VOICE) Office, which helps Americans recover from the huge number of crimes inflicted by the illegal aliens who were allowed into the country during President Barack Obamas   tenure. VOICE is just a report your local illegal program, Saldana responded. From what I understand is being reported, its: Oh, I see my   neighbors landscaper. He looks Mexican. I want to report him. Maybe someone ought to pick him up, said Saldana, who told a Capitol Hill panel in 2015 that ICEs job was public safety, not actual enforcement of the nations popular immigration laws. According to Foreign Policy: Saldaa maintains that before Trumps election ICE was poised to greatly expand the outreach program and remove the curtain from immigration enforcement activities. Community relations officers were being trained to assuage fear in immigrant communities with facts about the agencys priorities and activities. Since 2014, ICEs focus has changed [from deporting illegals] to deporting violent criminals, gang members, and recent arrivals. Saldaa said this policy opened the door to building trust with a variety of community groups, encouraging them to report serious criminal activity        I was trying to go out to the communities and explain: We are interested in criminals, not in the family of four who has been here 40 years and has not broken any other laws, Saldaa said. Under Obama, federal officials slashed efforts to repatriate illegals and even foreign criminals. DHS Secretary John Kelly directed the new policy change in a February 25, 2017 memo, where he said:  I direct the Director of ICE to immediately reallocate any and all resources that are currently used to advocate on behalf of illegal aliens (except as necessary to comply with a judicial order) to the new VOICE Office, and to immediately terminate the provision of such outreach or advocacy services to illegal aliens. Analysts estimate that roughly 11 million illegal aliens are living in the United States. Roughly 8 million of the illegals hold jobs, which adds up to one job for each of the four million young Americans who turn 18 each year. The illegals inclusion in the nations labor pool makes it harder for young Americans to get   jobs, and annually transfers roughly $500 billion from employees to employers, according to George Borjas, a Harvard professor. In addition, illegal immigrants inflict a huge number of crimes on Americans.  For example, almost   of a million aliens were registered at Texas jails from June 2011 to May 2017. Their convictions included 496 murders, 26, 000 assaults, 8, 400 burglaries, 246 kidnappings and 2, 900 sexual assaults."
Donald Trump Mocks Resist Democrats at Obamacare Meeting with Senate Republicans,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/13/2017,"President Donald Trump met with Republican senators for lunch at the White House to discuss progress on the bill to replace Obamacare, using the occasion to highlight the failures of former President Barack Obamas signature healthcare plan and the obstruction of Democrats. [Obamacare has been broken, and its been a broken promise, Trump said to the press, pointing to the lies by Democrats that Americans could keep their doctor and their plan and would experience lower premiums. He cited the Obamacares leading to skyrocketing premiums in multiple states, many over 100 percent increases.  Trump did not go into detail about what the Senate Republican bill would include, but he said it would be phenomenal and generous, kind, with heart.  The Democrats, Trump said, were obstructionists, whom he said would never support Republican efforts to fix health care. Even their new motto     Resist     I guess its a pretty accurate motto. Every time I see it, I say, Thats right. That does represent the Democrats, he said. The president said he had great respect for the Senate Republicans who attended the lunch: Senator Rob Portman ( )Senator John Thune ( )Senator Pat Toomey ( )Senator Mike Lee ( )Senator Ted Cruz ( )Senator Lamar Alexander ( )Senator John Barrasso ( )Senator Cory Gardner ( )Senator Tom Cotton ( )Senator Lisa Murkowski ( )Senator Susan Collins ( )Senator Joni Ernst ( )Senator Orrin Hatch ( ) Ive gotten to know and love some of them and know and like others, he said as the senators laughed. When asked about the timing of the Republican Senate healthcare bill, Trump replied, As soon as we can do it.  The president is expected to meet with families experiencing the failed promises of Obamacare during a trip to Wisconsin Tuesday."
Trump may be about to fire special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation,Business Insider,Bryan Logan,6/13/2017,"President Donald Trump may fire Robert Mueller, the       former FBI director who is now in charge of the         investigation.     President Donald Trump may consider firing Robert Mueller, the   special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation.     Hes weighing that option, said Chris Ruddy, Newsmax CEO and   friend of Trump on PBS NewsHour Monday evening. I personally   think it would be a very significant mistake     even though I   dont think theres a justification . .. for a special counsel in   this case, Ruddy said.     Ruddy  on Monday, but it was not   immediately clear whether the subject of Mueller came up during   his visit.     In the interview with PBS, Ruddy called out what he described as   conflicts surrounding Muellers law firm, WilmerHale, which has   represented Trumps former campaign manager and members of the   Trump family. Ruddy also said Trump had interviewed Mueller for   the role of FBI director before Mueller was named special counsel   in charge of the Russia investigation.     White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in an email to   Business Insider Monday night: Mr. Ruddy never spoke to the   President regarding this issue. With respect to this subject,   only the President or his attorneys are authorized to comment.        In the last 36 hours, people in Trumps orbit have floated   conflicting narratives on the matter. A lawyer for Trump  Sunday that he is not going to speculate   about whether Trump may fire Mueller. But Trumps conservative   allies  despite initially   praising his appointment.     Trumps allies now claim the results Mueller comes up with in the   investigation into whether Trump campaign associates colluded   with Russian officials during the 2016 election will be tainted   and biased, Business Insiders Allan Smith reported earlier   Tuesday, due in part to former FBI director James Comeys Senate   testimony last week.        At his hearing before the Senate Intelligence Committee on   Thursday, Comey said that he gave a friend, a Columbia law   professor, permission to share with news outlets Comeys memos   documenting private meetings he had with Trump.     Comey testified that he believed the revelations in his memos       including concern that Trump sought to influence the FBIs Russia   investigation     would prompt the appointment of a special   counsel.     While Trump as president would be within his right to fire   Mueller, that potential move is largely seen as problematic for a   president already plagued by suggestions he have overstepped his   boundaries in his interactions with Comey.     Rep. Adam Schiff, ranking member of the House Intelligence   Committee attempted to  of Trump firing Mueller.     If President fired Bob Mueller, Congress would immediately     independent counsel and appoint Bob Mueller. Dont   waste our time, Schiff said. It is unclear, however, exactly how   the   Congress would react to Muellers firing, if   it were to happen.     Richard Painter, who served as top White House ethics lawyer   under George W. Bush, offered an unvarnished take on the   rumblings Monday night.     Rumors going around that POTUS wants to fire Mueller, he said.   That had better be fake news or this presidency will be over   very soon.  President Donald Trump may fire Robert Mueller. .."

Theater Behind Trump-Stabbing Julius Caesar Refuses to Back Down,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/13/2017,"NEW YORK (AP)     The Public Theater is refusing to back down after backlash over its production of Julius Caesar that portrays a Donald   dictator in a business suit with a long tie who gets knifed to death onstage. [Delta Air Lines and Bank of America have pulled their sponsorship of the Publics version of the play, but in a statement Monday the theater said it stands behind the production. It noted its staging has provoked heated discussion but such discussion is exactly the goal of our   theater this discourse is the basis of a healthy democracy.   Other defenders included Scott M. Stringer, the New York City comptroller, who wrote letters to the heads of Delta and Bank of America, arguing that dropping their support sends the wrong message.  He writes: Art matters. The First Amendment matters. Expression matters.  He enclosed copies of the play with the letters. I hope you enjoy it     it is a classic, in any age, he wrote. This   Caesars violent death at the hands of conspirators comes not long after comedian Kathy Griffin was widely condemned for posing for a photograph in which she gripped a bloodied rendering of Trumps head. Though the Publics version of William Shakespeares classic play is unchanged from its    original, the production portrays Caesar with a gold bathtub and a pouty Slavic wife. Trumps name is never mentioned, but backlash was swift. On Sunday, Donald Trump Jr. retweeted a Fox News story about the play and wrote, I wonder how much of this art is funded by taxpayers? Serious question, when does art become political speech  does that change things? Delta responded by saying artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste.  Bank of America said the Public chose to present the play to provoke and offend without the banks knowledge: Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it.  Julius Caesar ends its run Sunday. The comedy A Midsummer Nights Dream begins in the park on July 11. The National Endowment for the Arts, which Trump, a Republican, once proposed eliminating, said that while the Publics Shakespeare programing has received its grants in the past none was awarded for Julius Caesar or for funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts grant for the Public. Theater lovers were quick to point out that a national tour of Julius Caesar in 2012 by The Acting Company featured a Caesar played by a black actor in a modern business suit who had a resemblance to   Barack Obama, a Democrat. Sponsors of the Guthrie Theater, including Delta, apparently had no objections when that show landed in Minneapolis. The Public has long protected its role as incubator of provocative and challenging works, unafraid to mount plays that comment on current events or update Shakespearian plays to explore modern themes. Its had Trump in its sights before. Its the institution that birthed the megahit Hamilton, whose cast members last year implored Vice   Mike Pence to support diversity, and where Meryl Streep donned   and a fat suit last summer to impersonate Trump at a gala fundraiser. Laurence Maslon, an administrator and arts professor at New York Universitys Tisch School of the Arts, said it was disingenuous for large corporations that have backed the Public for years and enjoyed   its downtown cool vibe to sound alarmed now. Youve got to know what youre getting into, he said, adding that the Public has 50 years of the most provocative, politically engaged work.  He backed the Julius Caesar director, Oskar Eustis, saying hes nothing if not brave.  The Public produced Embedded, Tim Robbins   2003 riff on the events leading to the war in Iraq that had actors portraying hawkish presidential advisers wearing masks with grotesque facial expressions. In 2006, Eustis dedicated the summer season in Central Park to three works that focused on foreign affairs     Stuff Happens, in which David Hare looked at the debates in Washington in the   to the Iraq war, a militaristic production of Macbeth set in the early 20th century and a Mother Courage with a new translation by Tony Kushner that had references to tax exemptions for the rich. Maslon said he thinks any loss of funding the Public experiences from corporate defectors will be compensated for by donations from liberal   groups and people worried about the apparent threat to artistic freedom. I can imagine any sense that this political regime is imposing a kind of censorship and the free market can help correct it will probably be good for the Public, he said. The Public isnt the only theater project trying to address the advent of Trump. On Broadway, Jon Jon Briones, who plays the sleazy Engineer in a revival of Miss Saigon, makes a sarcastic reference to the Trump campaign slogan, Make America Great Again.  The recent   play Building the Wall, by playwright Robert Schenkkan, imagined the country under Trumps campaign promise to detain immigrants living in the country illegally. And filmmaker and activist Michael Moore is bringing a   show taking on Trump to Broadway this summer."
NBC Moving Ahead with Megyn Kelly-Alex Jones Interview Despite Backlash,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/13/2017,"NEW YORK (AP)     NBC News is moving ahead with plans to air Megyn Kellys interview with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones this weekend despite a backlash that has cost the show advertisers and led to Kelly being dropped as host for an event by an organization founded by parents of children killed at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. [The network has been taken aback by the response to booking Jones, the Infowars host who has questioned whether the killing of 26 people in 2012 at the school in Newton, Connecticut, was a hoax. NBC News Chairman Andy Lack said the story will be edited with the sensitivity of its critics in mind.  Its important to get it right, Lack said. Reporters have interviewed controversial characters like Syrian President Bashar Assad and child molesters in the past without getting this kind of a reaction, Kelly said in an interview Tuesday. What I think were doing is journalism, she said. The bottom line is that while its not always popular, its important. I would submit to you that neither I nor NBC News has elevated Alex Jones in any way. Hes been elevated by 5 or 6 million viewers or listeners, and by the president of the United States. As you know, journalists dont get the choice over who has power or influence in our country.  Sandy Hook Promise, an   violence group, said it had asked Kelly to step down as host of its   gala in Washington. The group cannot support Kelly or NBCs decision to give a platform to Jones and hopes NBC reconsiders its plan to broadcast the interview, said Nicole Hockley,   and managing director. Hockley, whose    son Dylan was killed at Sandy Hook, founded the organization with Mark Barden, who lost his    son Daniel. Kelly said she understood and respected the decision, but was disappointed. NBCs plans have cost it some advertisers for this weeks edition of Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly.  It was not immediately clear how many only the financial firm JPMorgan Chase has been publicly identified. That comes with the territory, Lack said. Its not unusual. We kind of know when were doing controversial stories, thats going to happen. It doesnt stop us from doing controversial stories.  To some critics, NBCs timing makes the decision worse     airing on Fathers Day an interview that has been publicly denounced by parents who lost young children at Sandy Hook. NBC said it was scheduled for competitive reasons, because Jones had been booked to appear on ABCs daytime show The View next week. A representative of The View said Jones had canceled his appearance there and he will not be rescheduled. Lack noted that he had suggested approaching Jones for an interview to David Corvo, the NBC News executive who supervises the networks newsmagazines. He said theres nothing new about putting people on the air even if theyre unpopular or have views that are deplorable to many. Ive got tremendous understanding of why theyre so upset, as they have every right to be, he said. Of course were looking at it. Were looking at the editorial process.  The interview has put Kelly, who jumped to NBC from Fox News Channel earlier this year, squarely back in the headlines the New York Daily News called it Nutwork News on its front page Tuesday. She was one of Trumps favorite targets during the presidential campaign because he was annoyed at tough questions she asked him at a   debate. Jones, for his part, has already denounced the interview as fake news and said it was purposeful hit job on him. I knew in my gut this was going to blow up in their face, he said on his show."

Megyn Kelly Dropped as Host of Sandy Hook Promise Gala over Alex Jones Interview,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/13/2017,"Megyn Kelly has agreed to step down as host of a gun violence prevention fundraiser related to the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary massacre after receiving heavy backlash over an upcoming interview with InfoWars founder Alex Jones, who has said that the attack was a hoax. [The Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly anchor had been scheduled to host the Promise Champions Gala     an event organized by Sandy Hook Promise, a gun control nonprofit formed in the wake of the horrific 2012 attack on a Connecticut elementary school that left 27 dead, including 20 children     on June 14th in Washington, D. C.  But the NBC News anchors interview with Jones, set to air on Fathers Day, June 18, has prompted the group to disinvite Kelly from appearing at the event, according to Variety. Sandy Hook Promise cannot support the decision by Megyn or NBC to give any form of voice or platform to Alex Jones and have asked Megyn Kelly to step down as our Promise Champion Gala host, Nicole Hockley,   and managing director of Sandy Hook Promise, said in a statement. It is our hope that Megyn and NBC reconsider and not broadcast this interview.  Kelly     who left Fox News earlier this year to lead two news programs at NBC     shared a preview clip of her interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday. In the clip, Kelly asks Jones how he feels about being called the most paranoid man in the world, while the radio host and InfoWars founder says he believes   was an inside job and that he was unfairly maligned for his views on the Sandy Hook attack.

Kelly addressed the controversy on her own Twitter page, explaining that Donald Trumps appearance on Jones radio show during the 2016 presidential race made the media figure newsworthy and deserving of an interview: Many dont know him our job is 2 shine a light, she tweeted. Still, at least one advertiser, JPMorgan Chase, reportedly asked NBC News to pull its TV and digital ads from appearing alongside promotional material for the Jones interview. The banks chief marketing officer, Kristin Lemkau, wrote on Twitter that she was repulsed that NBC News and Kelly gave Jones a platform. In a statement Tuesday, Kelly said she was disappointed that she would not be able to attend and support Wednesday nights Sandy Hook promise event, though she said she understood and respected the decision. I find Alex Jones suggestion that Sandy Hook was a hoax as personally revolting as every other rational person does, Kelly wrote in a statement posted to her Twitter account.

Macy Gray talks racism in America and her biggest problem with Trump,CNN,Deena Zaru,6/13/2017,"Los Angeles (CNN) Macy Gray is known for her edgy, enigmatic voice and her soulful music about love and life, but in her 10th studio release, which will be out this summer, the   singer is getting political in a way she hasnt before. For me, being a black female, that puts me right in the thick of all the racism thats going on and all the misogyny, the RB singer told CNN. Fans got a taste of whats to come when Gray released White Man in February    an anthem about racism in America. The video features a tense yet harmonious dance between a black woman and a white woman that represents both the deep divisions and the unity that characterize race relations in America. Grays decision to address politics and social issues is part of a larger trend as musicians    even those who are traditionally apolitical in their music like Katy Perry and Zedd    have recently made political statements. The I Try singer, who backed Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the 2016 presidential election, talked with CNNs #GetPolitical series about what inspired her new music and what she thinks about President Donald Trump. CNN: How was your upcoming album inspired by the political climate? Gray: For me, being a black female, that puts me right in the thick of all the racism thats going on and all the misogyny . .. So all of the back and forth has kind of put people like me right in the middle of all the controversy, the disagreement, the fights and all the protests. As an artist, its hard to go into the studio and not be affected by that. CNN: Whats the message behind White Man? Gray: White Man was inspired by all the things that are going on right now in our country and I felt like it was needed. I just feel like were in a time with a lot of divisiveness and people not understanding each other. (Theres) a lot of dissent and protest and people being angry and a lot of opinions and White Man was just my contribution to bringing people together. CNN: How is your new album different than other music collections youve released? Gray: The record is amazing. Its really, really fresh music and lyrics. Its a little bit politically driven. I just think in this climate and whats going on its hard to be an artist and not be inspired by all the issues, especially when its personal to you. This album will definitely be more about the world, more about politics than my past albums just because of the environment that weve all been forced into. But I think thats a good thing, you know. I think really think thats how we got from 60s to the 80s, because of music. Because you had people like Bob Marley and Stevie Wonder and Gil   speaking about the times and about revolution and what needs to be changed and I dont know if music saves the world but it definitely . .. inspires people. CNN: Would you like to see other artists get political? Gray: I hope other artists get involved in the whole    not so much preaching to people, but just making it known that the issues are right in front of us and it would, I personally think it would be just neglectful to let it be, to let it just come out however it comes out, to not be involved or to not pitch in in some way and make sure things go in the right direction. CNN: Who did you vote for in 2016? Gray: I did not vote for Mr. Trump. I actually wrote in Bernie. I never got over Bernie. That really broke my heart. CNN: How do you assess Trumps presidency, so far? Gray: My biggest problem with (Trump) is hes an amateur. Hes never done this before . .. this dude has never even been a mayor and I think thats dangerous, thats dangerous for our country when he talks to other world leaders who have devoted their entire careers to politics . .. With all his craziness and tweets    thats whatever, but the fact that he has no idea what hes doing is scary to me. Im just thinking like, you know,     it! Lets give, why dont we let 2 Chainz be the Supreme Court justice, lets give Meryl Streep the surgeon general. I mean, who cares at this point? We have a leadership that has no experience and thats wild to me . .. thats my biggest problem with Mr. Trump. Other than that, hes an old, white dude from New York, thats what they do.

Durants relationship with his mother, of course, became famous   after his   MVP speech in 2014 in which he dedicated   the award to her.     After winning the championship, Durant and his mom united at   halfcourt and shared a heartwarming moment.    Kevin Durant hugs his mom as they embrace. Then, they both embrace Steph Curry.     Moments later, in an interview with ESPNs Doris Burke, Durants   mother interrupted him to remind him, Dont matter what nobody   say, you did it!    Kevin Durant enjoyed a heartwarming moment when his mom interrupted his postgame interview. Dont matter what nobody say, you did it!

Kevin Durant proved he was the missing piece the Warriors needed and got the championship he craved,Business Insider,Tyler Lauletta,6/13/2017,"Kevin Durant got his title.     After making the difficult decision to leave his NBA home in   Oklahoma City to join the team that eliminated the Thunder team   he lead in the   season, Durant received criticism on all   fronts.     He couldnt beat them so he joined them. He was turning heel. He   was giving up on his team to go join a supergroup.     But it was all in service of one goal     an NBA title.     In the modern era of hot takes and #NBATwitter, Kevin Durant   was keenly aware of how the modern history of basketball is   written. While the takes are ephemeral, coming and going everyday   to be replaced by another, titles are forever. Ask Magic. Ask   Jordan. And then ask Barkley. They all know.     Our world revolves around championships, . Who won the championship?   Who will win the championship? If youre not the champion, youre   a loser. If youre not first, youre last.     That story was published while the   Thunder were up     on the Warriors in the 2016 Western Conference Finals. That lead   would grow to   before the Thunder fell in seven games, leading   to another   lead that we all know the end of. Just weeks   later, Durant would sign with the Warriors.     On Monday night and all throughout The Finals, Kevin Durant   proved not only that he was a champion, but that he was just the   piece the Warriors needed to solve the puzzle of LeBron James and   the Cleveland Cavaliers.        In Game 5 he put up 39 points, 7 rebounds, and 5 assists behind      shooting, including going    from behind the arc,   and during the entirety of The Finals he never scored less than   30 for the Warriors.     But it wasnt just the numbers Durant was putting up     it was the   moments that he was able to step up that really set the Warriors   up for championship glory this year.     Take this game as a microcosm. At the start of the fourth with   the Cavs biting at their heels looking to mount a comeback,   Durant was there to shut the door every time. Every time   Cleveland came within reach, KD was there to hit another   contested three and beat the opposition back.       Durant also provided the one piece that the Cavs simply could not   match up against. When the Warriors were led by the triumvirate   of Curry, Klay, and Dray, the Cavs had ways of keeping pace. That   group led the Warriors to 73 regular season wins, but when they   met Cleveland in The Finals they were still stoppable. Maybe   Draymond gets in foul trouble. Maybe the Cavs go big. Maybe Kyrie   takes over for a half and goes lights out.     But adding one of the best players in the league and allowing   that holy trinity to act as role players in some cases left   Cleveland with no room for error. The Warriors and Kevin Durant   were both well familiar with what it meant to blow a   lead,   and on Monday night showed just how serious they were about never   letting it happen again.     Kevin Durant got his championship and was named Finals MVP, both   firsts for his career. And if the Warriors can keep their core   together, its quite possible theres more on the way.

"Report: 3 Members of Special Counsel Muellers Team Donated to Dems, Including Hillary, Obama",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/13/2017,"Individuals who have been hired to be a part of the Justice Department team investigating Russian influence in the U. S. 2016 presidential election have made thousands of dollars in donations to Democrat political campaigns. [Three members of Special Counsel Robert Muellers team made the donations to Democrats, including to Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, according to a CNN analysis using Federal Election Commission records. CNN reported:  More than half of the more than $56, 000 came from just one lawyer and more than half of it was donated before the 2016 election, but two of the lawyers gave the maximum $2, 700 donation to Hillary Clinton last year. Over the weekend, news outlets including CNN identified five attorneys that Mueller has already brought on board to help investigate potential collusion between associates of President Donald Trumps campaign and Russia. The attorneys on the team have worked on other   cases, including Watergate and the Enron fraud scandal, as well as representing U. S. companies in legal dealings, according to CNN. Three of the five lawyers gave overwhelmingly to Democrats, totaling more than $53, 000 since 1988, and more than half of those donations came from just one lawyer, James Quarles, who works at the same firm where Mueller worked, WilmerHale. Quarles gave nearly $33, 000 to political campaigns, including presidential candidates Michael Dukakis, Al Gore, John Kerry, Barack Obama, and Hillary Clinton. Quarles also gave more than $10, 000 to help Democrats running for the House and another $10, 000 to candidates running for Senate seats, including money to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, CNN reported. Ironically, Quarles is also the only lawyer among Muellers team who donated to Republicans, giving $2, 500 to Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) in 2015 and $250 to  . George Allen ( ) back in 2005. Only about 30 percent of the donations were for 2016 elections, according to CNN, including Quarless and Jeannie Rhees, who both gave the maximum $2, 700 contribution to Clintons campaign last year. Rhee has donated more than $16, 000 since 2008, all to Democrats, including the maximum allowed contribution to the Clinton campaign in 2016 and 2015, totaling $5, 400. She also gave $7, 300 to both of Obamas presidential campaigns. Perhaps more importantly, Rhee has already been in the spotlight for representing the Clinton Foundation in a racketeering lawsuit brought by a conservative advocacy group, and also representing Clinton herself in a lawsuit seeking access to her private emails. Mueller, who was FBI director under by President George W. Bush, also hired Andrew Weissmann, who led the Enron investigation, gave $2, 300 to Obamas first presidential campaign in 2008, and $2, 000 to the Democratic National Committee in 2006. FEC records do not show any donations by Weissman in the 2016 election cycle, according to CNN. There also are no FEC records for Aaron Zebley, who left WilmerHale to work on the Russia investigation. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who endorsed Trump, said on Monday that Muellers team cant be impartial given their political activism. Republicans are delusional if they think the special counsel is going to be fair, Gingrich tweeted. Look who he is hiring. Check FEC reports. Time to rethink.

Bret Weinstein to Tucker Carlson: It May Not be Safe to Return to Evergreen State - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Ciccotta,6/13/2017,"Evergreen State College Professor Bret Weinstein claimed that it may be unsafe for him to return to campus in his second interview with Tucker Carlson, which aired on Monday night.[  Professor Bret Weinstein made a second appearance on Tucker Carlsons Fox News program on Monday evening to speak on the status of the chaos that erupted after he gently pushed back against Evergreen State Colleges Day of Absence event, which encouraged white community members to leave campus for a day. Carlson began the interview by claiming that Weinstein has relocated his family for their safety. Weinstein claimed that he has not returned to campus because the administration has yet to acknowledge the danger that their handling of the protests has put Weinstein and his family in. He also suggested that returning to campus may not be safe at this moment. Weinstein claimed that he has received tremendous support from the public outside of the college, but lamented the fact that only one of his colleagues had publicly condemned the witch hunt. Not leaving meant that you were not an ally, Weinstein said, referencing the backlash he received to his refusal to participate in the Day of Absence.  On a college campus, people should be equally free to be on campus, irrespective of their skin color, Weinstein added.

Marco Rubio Pushes Left-Wing Conspiracy Theory About Trump Advancing Russian Interests in Ukraine,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/13/2017,"During Tuesdays Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Sen. Marco Rubio ( ) pushed the misleading Democratic Party talking point that the Republican Party platform was changed to not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. [Here is a transcript of the relevant section of the hearing:   RUBIO: My last question, you were on the foreign policy team and the Republican platform was changed to not provide defensive weapons to Ukraine. Were you involved in that decision and do you know how the change was made?  SESSIONS: I was not active in the platform committee and did not participate in that, and I dont think I had direct involvement. RUBIO: Do you know who did or you have no recollection of a debate about that issue internally in the campaign? SESSIONS: I never watched the debate, if it occurred, on the platform committee. I think it did. So I dont recall that, Senator. Id have to think about that. Rubio was alluding to the conspiracy theory that Donald Trumps 2016 presidential campaign had the Republican Party platform changed on the issue of Ukraine to allegedly aid Russian interests. The charge, which comes mostly from a Washington Post opinion piece, remains so unproven that even the   PolitiFact   fact checker failed to reach a judgement on the issue, allowing its hard to use those news reports as evidence in this  .  The entire issue revolved around one platform committee member, a Ted Cruz supporter, who wanted to use language calling for the U. S. to provide lethal defensive weapons to the Ukrainian military. Instead the platform eventually called for appropriate assistance to Ukraine     which leaves open the possibility of providing lethal defensive weapons     and called for greater coordination with NATO defense planning.  That was enough for the Washington Posts Josh Rogin to pen an opinion piece titled Trump campaign guts GOPs   stance on Ukraine.  MSNBCs Rachel Maddow used the tidbit to claim on television that something weird happened regarding that Ukraine and Russia thing on the platform. She claimed the Trump campaign jumped right up on that and they insisted that that plank only, that one, had to be taken out, that language could not stand.  Writing at the Washington Examiner, media critic Byron York noted: Missing from all the talk is what the Republican platform actually said before it was allegedly gutted by Trump. What did the original draft of the platform say about Russia and Ukraine? Was it, in fact, changed? If so, how? As it turns out, a look at the original draft of the platform     which has never been released publicly     shows that it always had tough language on Russian aggression in Ukraine. And not only did that language stay in the final platform     nothing was taken out     it was actually strengthened, not weakened, as a result of events at the convention.        Not only that, the later, final platform contained a few additional words on Russia and Ukraine that werent in the original draft.

Sessions: I Did Not Recuse Myself From Defending My Honor Against Scurrilous and False Allegations - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/13/2017,"During his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday, Attorney General Jeff Sessions stated his recusal from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, does not, and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, and that I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations.   Sessions said, [T]he scope of my recusal, however, does not, and cannot interfere with my ability to oversee the Department of Justice, including the FBI, which has an $8 billion budget and 35, 000 employees. I presented to the president my concerns and those of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein about the ongoing leadership issues at the FBI, as stated in my letter recommending the removal of Mr. Comey, along with the deputy attorney generals memorandum on that issue, which have been released publicly by the White House. Those represent a clear statement of my views. I adopted the Deputy Attorney General Rosensteins points that he made in his memorandum and made my recommendation. It is absurd, frankly, to suggest that a recusal from a single specific investigation would render the attorney general unable to manage the leadership of the various Department of Justice law enforcement components that conduct thousands of investigations.  Sessions added, Finally, during his testimony, Mr. Comey discussed a conversation that he and I had about the meeting Mr. Comey had with the president. Im happy to share with the committee my recollection of that conversation that I had with Mr. Comey. Following a routine morning threat briefing, Mr. Comey spoke to me and my chief of staff. While he did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the president, apparently the day before, Mr. Comey expressed concern about proper communications protocol with the White House and with the president. I responded, he didnt recall this, but I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and the Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House. Mr. Comey had served in the department for better than two decades, and I was confident that he understood and would abide by the   rules limiting communications with the White House, especially about ongoing investigations. Thats whats so important to control. My comments encouraged him to do just that, and indeed, as I understand it, he, in fact, did that. Our Department of Justice rules on proper communications between the department and the White House have been in place for years. Mr. Comey well knew them. I thought and assumed correctly that he complied with them.  He concluded, I recuse myself from any investigation into the campaign for president, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations.

Jeff Sessions: Absolutely False He Communicated with Russians as Trump Campaign Surrogate - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/13/2017,"During his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday Attorney General Jeff Sessions said it is absolutely false the he had ongoing communications with Russian officials as a surrogate for   Donald Trumps presidential campaign. [Sessions made the remark after Sen. Jim Risch ( ) said that fired FBI Director James Comey said during his testimony before the committee last week that he had very specific recollection of not being able to find a scintilla of evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians, and that the New York Times reporting to that end was false.  Theres been no reports that I know of any factual information in that regard, Risch said, adding that the committee had been through thousands of pages of information thus far. Are you aware of any such information? Risch asked. Sessions then cited a   exchange during his January confirmation hearing when Sen. Al Franken ( ) asked him a question about a now discredited CNN report about a dossier containing allegations that the Russians had incriminating information on Trump. But you would know more than I, Sessions said. What was said that would suggest I participated in continuing communications with the Russians as a surrogate is absolutely false."
Cotton: Accusation Sessions Colluded With Russian Ambassador at Mayflower A Ridiculous Plot Line - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/13/2017,"During Attorney General Jeff Sessions testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Senator Tom Cotton ( ) asked whether any spy fiction had a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage?  Cotton said, [A] very simple question that should be asked is, did Donald Trump or any of his associates in the campaign collude with Russia in hacking those emails and releasing them to the public? Thats where we started six months ago. We have now heard from six of the eight Democrats on this committee, and, to my knowledge, I dont think a single one of them asked that question. Theyve gone down lots of other rabbit trails, but not that question. Maybe that is because Jim oCmey said last week, as he said to Donald Trump, that on three times he assured him he was not under investigation. Maybe its because multiple Democrats on this committee have stated they have seen no evidence thusfar, after six months of our investigation and ten     11 months of an FBI investigation of any such collusion. I would just suggest, what do we think happened at the Mayflower? Mr. Sessions, are you familiar with what spies called tradecraft? After Sessions responded, A little bit.  Cotton continued, That involves things like covert communications and dead drops and brush passes, right? Sessions answered thats part of it.  Cotton then asked Sessions if he liked spy fiction. After Sessions answered in the affirmative, Cotton asked, Have you ever, in any of these fantastical situations, heard of a plot line so ridiculous that a sitting United States senator and an ambassador of a foreign government colluded at an open setting with hundreds of other people to pull off the greatest caper in the history of espionage?

Echo Chamber: Senators Ask Jeff Sessions Same Question About Russians 12 Times - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/13/2017,"Despite the fact that Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeatedly outlined the conversations he said he had with Russian diplomats during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, Senators at Tuesdays Senate Intelligence Committee repeatedly peppered Sessions with various forms of the same question     whether he had met with Russian officials during the course of the campaign. [It was not clear whether those inquiring senators     mostly Democrats and some Republicans     expected a different answer to the same question.  Sessions previously acknowledged that he met twice with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak in his capacity as a senator and chairman of the Senates Subcommittee on Strategic Forces. In his opening remarks, Sessions stated unequivocally that he had never had any conversations with Russian officials about interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. Sessions declared: Let me state this clearly: I have never met with or had any conversations with Russians or any foreign officials concerning any interference with any campaign or election. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.  I was your colleague in this body for 20 years, and the suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor over 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process is an appalling and detestable lie, he said. I recused myself from any investigation into the campaigns for President, but I did not recuse myself from defending my honor against scurrilous and false allegations.  In his remarks Tuesday, Sessions again addressed a third possible brief encounter with Kislyak, who was a guest in the audience at an April foreign policy speech delivered by   Trump at the Mayflower hotel. Sessions reportedly attended a   reception with dozens of other guests, including Kislyak. He says he did not meet privately with Kislyak and does not recall greeting him, but allows that the two may have exchanged a passing interaction     one that would have taken place in a room full of attendees. I attended a reception with my staff, that included at least two dozen people and President Trump, though I do recall several conversations I had during that   reception, and I do not have recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian ambassador or any other Russian officials. If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian ambassador in that reception, I do not remember it.  Despite Sessions accounting of his meetings with Russian diplomats during the course of the 2016 presidential campaign, senators repeatedly peppered Sessions with the same general question about whether he had met with Russian officials during the course of the campaign. Here are 12 times from Tuesdays hearing that senators asked Sessions whether he met with Russian officials: 1     Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr ( ) asked, One, did you have any meetings with Russian officials or their proxies on behalf of the Trump campaign or during your time as attorney general? 2     Burr asked, From your testimony, you said you dont remember whether the ambassador from Russia was there? 3     Burr: You never remember having a conversation or meeting with the ambassador? 4     Burr: You reported two other meetings with the ambassador, one in July on the sidelines of the Republican convention, I believe and one in September in your senate office. Have you had any other interactions with government officials over the year in a campaign capacity? 5     Sen. Mark Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, asked: And again, echoing what the chairman said, again for the record, there was no other meeting with any other officials of the Russian government in the campaign season? 6     Sen. Roy Blunt ( ): So when you said you possibly had a meeting with Mr. Kislyak, did you mean you possibly met him? 7     Sen. Joe Manchin ( ): If I could, sir, did you have any meetings, any other meetings with Russian officials that have not previously been disclosed? 8     Manchin: Im going to go quick through this. Are there any other meetings between Russian government officials and any other Trump campaign associates that have not been previously disclosed that you know of? 9     Sen. Kamala Harris ( ): Did you have any communications with Russian officials for any reason during the campaign that have not been disclosed in public or to this committee? 10     Harris: Did you have any communication with any Russian businessman or any Russian nationals? 11     Harris: Are you aware of any communications (with Russians)? 12     Harris: Are you aware of any communications with any Trump officials or did you have any communications with any officials about Russia or Russian interests in the United States before January 20?

Tory-DUP Government Deal Expected Wednesday After Very Good Discussions - Breitbart,Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,6/13/2017,"Democratic Unionist Party leader Arlene Foster has hailed the very good discussions representatives of her Northern Ireland (Ulster) based party have been having with Theresa Mays Conservatives, with political observers now expecting an official pact between the parties as early as Wednesday. [Hoping to form a parliamentary pact with the DUP after the Conservatives collapse in seats following last weeks snap general election, negotiators from Theresa Mays Tories have been hammering out a deal with the   group Tuesday, in the second day of official talks.  Speaking to the BBC about the progress in negotiations, DUP boss Arlene Foster declined to negotiate on the airwaves but praised progress, and gave insight into the areas over which the agreement was being made. She said: Weve had some very good discussions again today, and these discussions continued into the afternoon. I hope we can reach a conclusion sooner rather than later.

Discussions are going well with the government and we hope soon to be able to bring this work to a successful conclusion.     Arlene Foster (@DUPleader) June 13, 2017,  As for what she expected in return for supporting the Conservative government, Foster said she had discussed doing whats right for Northern Ireland with respect to economic matters. This remark could refer to points within the DUP manifesto that aim to make Northern Ireland more competitive for businesses than their southern neighbour, the Republic of Ireland. Amongst those initiatives is a cut of corporation tax to 12. 5 per cent     well below the Conservative goal of 17 per cent and the present figure of 19 per cent. More outlandish is the establishment of freeports     tax and customs free trading areas     in economically underdeveloped parts of the UK a sure euphemism for Ulster. Other ambitions laid out within the DUP manifesto while   for traditional conservatives have caused consternation amongst Britains political left. The manifesto promise to freeze then cut or abolish the TV licence and the possibility it may be a price demanded by the DUP for supporting the government, has so worried Labour deputy leader Tom Watson he was motivated to appeal to the Conservatives Tuesday that they would pledge not to scrap the licence fee. Writing to Conservative Culture Minister Karen Brady, Watson said: The DUPs manifesto includes a commitment to freeze then cut or abolish the TV licence       I urge you to fight hard to ensure that this pledge is not included in any agreement, formal or otherwise, between the Conservative Party and the DUP, reports The Guardian. Slamming the BBCs main source of income, a levy on all homes which have a working television set whether they watch BBC programming or not, the DUP manifesto said: The TV licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communications that no longer exists. The success of Netflix and Amazon streaming services shows that   media can and does work."

CNN Cuts Feed After Senator Objects to Clinton Foundation Atty Joining Independent Counsel - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/13/2017,"CNN cut away from a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Tuesday morning, seconds after Sen. Lindsey Graham ( ) raised concerns that Special Counsel Robert Mueller had hired a former Clinton Foundation attorney to assist with the probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [Graham was questioning Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who was sitting in for Attorney General Jeff Sessions.  Democrats have long accused the Trump campaign of colluding with Russia, though no evidence has emerged. There is also speculation that Special Counsel Mueller will probe allegations of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump. Earlier this week, reports emerged that Mueller had hired attorneys for his investigative team who had donated to Hillary Clinton in the past, and one in particular who had represented the Clinton Foundation in its effort to block Freedom of Information Act requests for   on Clintons private server. Graham: Is giving political donations a reason to disqualify somebody for serving in the Special Counsels office? Rosenstein: No, Senator, it is not a disqualification. It is not. Graham: As a matter of fact, many states, the judges and prosecutors are actually elected. Donations are a part of that system, is that correct? Rosenstein: Yes, thats true. Graham: Would it be a disqualification for somebody in the Special Counsels office who had represented Mrs. Clinton in the past to serve? Rosenstein: You know, Senator, it would depend on facts and circumstances. As a general matter, I think the answer is no. Graham: Isnt that much closer to a conflict of interest? Rosenstein: I dont want to answer a hypothetical, Senator. Everybody needs to make a determination based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case. Graham: How would you get it before the Special Counsel? What process could a member of the Senate use to inform the Special Counsel that youd have a concern about hiring someone that represented Clinton? Rosenstein: We have a process within the Department of Justice, Senator, so I would encourage you, if you have those concerns, to raise them with [former] Director Mueller or to raise them with me, and Ill make sure     Graham: So should I do it to you or to him? Rosenstein: Well, you could do it to both. Graham: Okay. Thats fair enough. Rosenstein: And we have career     Graham: And I dont know if Ill do that, but Ive read some things that were     I dont think donations are disqualifying at all, but if you represented the Clinton Foundation or Clinton herself, that would be disturbing to me, but Ill take care of that.

"Venezuelan Police Resort to Robbing Civilians, Including Breitbart Reporter - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/13/2017,"CARACAS, Venezuela     Waiting to check in for my flight at Caracas airport on Wednesday, security services stopped me, demanding a full search of my belongings. [Scowling, underweight policemen speaking barely intelligible Spanish took me into a private room at the back of the airport. QHace Ac? they asked, slurring together the words for What are you doing here?  They rummaged through my luggage as I claimed to be a curious Spanish student interested in the countrys situation. Qsesto?     What is that? they asked, pulling out my camera. They demanded to see my photos. Many were images highlighting the extreme poverty across Caracas     piles of garbage lining the city, graffiti exclaiming Im hungry, defaced images of dictator Nicols Maduro. The officials confiscated my camera, claiming they needed to examine it and the process could take up to two hours, despite my flight leaving within an hour. I would never see the camera again. Initially, it was easy to dismiss the confiscation as a precaution against rogue journalists exposing the true devastation socialism has wrought in Venezuela. But look at recent reports in Venezuela suggests these confiscations     outright thefts of valuables by officers of the law     are not uncommon. And while I can afford another camera, the Venezuelan civilians most often experiencing this crime are struggling to survive amidst the countrys political and economic crisis. The truth is that the soldiers are struggling to survive, too, resorting to stealing from anyone they apprehend who happens to carry a valuable.   soldiers, Venezuelans told me, earn the minimum wage, $43 a month, while forced to use their authority to silence political dissidents. Thefts have become so common that, this week, the countrys defense minister Vladimir Padrino Lpez warned armed forces against excessive force, saying he did not want to see one more national guardsman committing an atrocity on the street.  He had not issued such a warning after months of brutal violence documented by his soldiers against the protesters. What it did follow was a broad accusation by opposition leaders that security forces stole possessions from protesters and journalists, such as motorcycles, cameras, and even shoes, during a demonstration that took place last week.

Soldiers stealing and assaulting civilians that they should be protecting, Olivares tweeted on Monday. Dont be the shame of the armed forces by following orders from superiors!

Esos no son oficiales, son delincuentes. Fase 3 del Plan Zamora?     Juan Andrs Meja (@JuanAndresMejia) June 5, 2017,  While the brazenness of these recent thefts is new, soldiers have been exploiting their power to make ends meet for months. A report from the Associated Press in January found that the Venezuelan military had seized full control of all food coming in and out of the country, and are reselling stolen products at astronomical markups. The report also found authorities regularly demanded bribes from food importers and truck drivers, thus hiking the prices of food products for ordinary Venezuelans. According to recent statistics, a majority of Venezuelans now go to bed hungry while 15 percent of people eat garbage just to survive.

"In video of Penn State hazing death, victim looked like a corpse",CNN,Sara Ganim,6/13/2017,"Bellefonte, Pennsylvania (CNN) Surveillance video inside a Penn State frat house showed a student who looked like a corpse by the time fraternity members came to his aid, a police detective said on Monday. Still, it would take nearly 40 minutes for Beta Theta Pi brothers to call 911 after finding    Timothy Piazza unconscious. Centre County prosecutors claim the video shows the students failed to help Piazza after a night of heavy drinking, causing his death the next day. Piazza suffered a traumatic brain injury from several falls, including one down a set of basement stairs, according to a grand jury investigation. Eighteen students have been charged with a variety of offenses, from involuntary manslaughter to   offenses    more than 1, 000 counts in all. Prosecutors showed the video for the first time Monday in a preliminary hearing to determine if theres enough evidence to go to trial. The video shows Piazza staggering through the house the night of February 2 before disappearing near basement stairs where police say he fell 15 steps and lost consciousness. The next few hours of video show him in and out of consciousness, rolling on the floor, struggling to stand and repeatedly falling and hitting his head before he disappears again the morning of February 3.  More than two hours later, the video shows several members carrying him to a couch. His eyes are closed and his legs and arms are visibly rigid, State College Police Det. Dave Scicchitano testified. His fist was clenched so tight that one of the students struggled to pry his fingers open. He looked dead. He looked like a corpse, Scicchitano said. Yet, instead of calling 911, they talked among themselves and searched their phones for information, Scicchitano said. They put him on a couch, put a blanket over him and stood around and talked for a while, Scicchitano said. That went on for an excruciating amount of time to watch without any action being taken. Courtroom decorum comes under scrutiny, Eight members of the fraternity face involuntary manslaughter charges in Piazzas February 4 death. Those eight and another 10 fraternity members were charged with counts including hazing, reckless endangerment, tampering with evidence, and   offenses. Sixteen of them appeared before a judge on Monday with their lawyers, filling the courtroom for a hearing lasting nearly 11 hours. Two others waived their right to a hearing.  The judge continued the hearing until July 10 after the defense argued they didnt have any time to question the police detective or make arguments. The hearing was prolonged by arguments from defense lawyers on a range of issues, including a motion to sever the cases, which was denied.  Confrontations among defense lawyers and Centre County District Attorney Stacy Parks Miller grew increasingly contentious as the day went on, leading District Judge Allen Sinclair to admonish the parties. One comment in particular drew the ire of Piazzas family.  Toward the end of the hearing, defense lawyer Andy Shubin stood up during a break and said it was cruel and unusual punishment to make the attorneys stay in court for so long. Other lawyers joined in the joke, shocking the Piazzas. Of course, this comes right after all of them watching video for five hours of what real cruel and inhumane punishment was when the fraternity brothers essentially murdered our son, tortured him, held him captive and left him for dead over a   period of time. Thankfully the judge quickly brought them in order, Jim Piazza said after court. We are highly offended by the insensitivity displayed given the severity of the crimes committed and ultimate outcome. The lighthearted behavior continued after the hearing as the defendants and their families gathered, the Piazzas lawyer, Tom Kline said. Joking among themselves. Kidding among themselves. You would have thought today that it was a fraternity reunion. It did not go unnoticed by me, and more importantly, by the family, he said. Piazzas parents were in court for part of the hearing. Jim Piazza held his head in his hands and sobbed as prosecutors showed pictures of his son in the hospital. On their lawyers advice, the couple left for the hourslong viewing of the video. This was no drinking party. This was an alcohol poisoning, followed by callous, reckless, inhumane behavior, Kline said. Lawyers for some of the defendants said the video only told part of the story. They pointed out that the defense does not have access to the video yet and only portions of it were shown in court Monday. I was underwhelmed by the evidence presented today, said Michael Engel, who represents Gary DeBilio. As it relates to my client we didnt hear a lot. . .. We have a lot more to go. Defense lawyer William Brennan, who represents Joseph Ems, said the video absolved his client.  Its a tragic situation, but criminally, Joey Ems did not commit a crime, he said. What the video showed, As a pledge of the fraternity, Piazza was put through the gauntlet, in which he moved from station to station drinking alcohol.  The surveillance video shows Piazza chugging from a bottle of liquor early in the night and chugging a beer at another point. A forensic pathologist said Piazza had a blood alcohol content between . 26% and . 36% at one point during the night. Within 90 minutes of starting the gauntlet, the video shows Piazza stumbling through the kitchen toward the basement steps. Two minutes later, the video shows a group carrying Piazza up the stairs unconscious. Moments later, fraternity brother Greg Rizzo sent a group text message saying Piazza had fallen down the stairs and might actually be a problem. The video shows Rizzo take off Piazzas shirt and position him on the couch. Student Ryan Foster sits on Piazzas legs in what he described to police as an attempt to keep him from moving, Scicchitano said. The fraternity members appear agitated and at one point a shoving match erupts between two men. One member wanted to take Piazza to the hospital but was pushed aside by another, Scicchitano testified. Shortly before 2 a. m. Piazza falls off the couch and the video appears to show Ems throw a shoe at his head. As Ems repositions Piazza on the couch, prosecutors say the video shows him punch Piazza in the abdomen, leaving a visible bruise on his side. Ems lawyer claims the video shows him reaching for him but not punching him. As the evening wears on the video jumps to Piazza lying in a fetal position on the ground, rolling around. He tries to get on his feet and falls back on the floor. He tries to get on his feet using his hands and falls over. He gets up, walks into a wall, turns around, stumbles and falls over in a pattern repeated for several hours as he staggers through the house in a   state. The video shows at least three people come upon him. One takes a look at him and keeps walking. Another captures Piazza on his phone as he rolls around. He posted it to Snapchat and later deleted it, Scicchitano testified. As morning breaks, Piazza walks in the direction of the basement steps. More than two hours later the video shows a group of men carrying him back to the couch around 9:30 a. m. His body is rigid as the men stand around, some with their hands on their hips. They pull out their phones and some make calls. One of them tries to pull his fingers apart. Another adjusts a blanket on him. About 40 minutes later, a 911 call is finally made, Scicchitano testified. As a result of the incident, Penn State President Eric Barron permanently banned the fraternity from the university."
Jeff Sessions Counters James Comeys Story - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/13/2017,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions repeated disagreements with   Director James Comeys account of the twos interaction in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday. [The dispute with Comeys testimony were first made by DOJ Spokesman Ian Prior immediately after Comey testified before the same body last week. Tuesday the attorney general himself took Comey to task for saying Sessions had shrugged as if to say what do you want me to do when the   FBI director asked Sessions to help him avoid impropriety in his communications with the White House.  Sessions, in his prepared remarks, characterized the same encounter as follows: While [Comey] did not provide me with any of the substance of his conversation with the President, Mr. Comey expressed concern about the proper communications protocol with the White House and with the President.  I responded to his comment by agreeing that the FBI and Department of Justice needed to be careful to follow Department policies regarding appropriate contacts with the White House.  Mr. Comey had served in the Department of Justice for the better part of two decades, and I was confident that Mr. Comey understood and would abide by the Departments   rules governing any communications with the White House about ongoing investigations.  My comments encouraged him to do just that and indeed, as I understand, he did. Sessions also hit back at Comeys assertion he was not instructed on how to deal with Sessionss recusal from the investigation: On the date of my formal recusal, my Chief of Staff sent an email to the heads of the relevant departments, including by name to Director Comey of the FBI, to instruct them to inform their staffs of this recusal and to advise them not to brief me or involve me in any such matters. And in fact, they have not.  Importantly, I recused myself not because of any asserted wrongdoing on my part during the campaign, but because a Department of Justice regulation, 28 CFR 45. 2, required it. Later Sen. Ron Wyden ( ) grilled Sessions on this recusal, using Comeys testimony to imply there was some damning unreleased information that informed Sessionss decision to recuse, leading to a heated exchange in which Wyden accused Sessions of stonewalling by refusing to discuss the limited information on the Russia probe he did receive before that decision. The attorney general shook his head slightly as he replied: Senator Wyden, I am not stonewalling.  I am following the historic policies on the Department of Justice. You dont walk into any hearing or committee meeting and reveal confidential communications with the President of the United States        Mr. Comey, perhaps he didnt know, but I basically recused myself the first day I got into the office. Wyden was unsatisfied, shooting back, General Sessions, respectfully, youre not answering the question.  A smile spread across Sessionss face as he asked chuckling, Well, what is the question? The question is, Mr. Comey said there were matters with respect to the recusal that were problematic and that he couldnt talk about them. What are they? Wyden snapped. Sessionss smile vanished, replaced with an indignant scowl. Why dont you tell me? There are none, Senator Wyden. There are none. I can tell you that for absolute certainty, the attorney general barked. Sessions continued to chastise Senator Wyden over his use of innuendo to imply wrongdoing and evasion on Sessionss part. I tried to give my best and truthful answers to any committee Ive appeared before and people are suggesting through innuendo that Ive not been honest about matters, he said, in an apparent reference to Comey. Sessions had switched his schedule around to testify before the intelligence committee specifically to follow up on Comeys testimony before the body. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein took Sessionss original engagement with the Senate Appropriations Committee where he too was asked about Comeys testimony."
"Sessions Comes Out Swinging, Dismisses Russian Meeting Controversy - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/13/2017,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions hit back against any implication of improper meetings with Russian officials in a prepared opening to his testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Tuesday. [Let me state this clearly colleagues. I have never met with or had any conversation with any Russian or any foreign officials concerning any type of interference with any campaign or election in the United States, Sessions told the committee. Further, I have no knowledge of any such conversations by anyone connected to the Trump campaign.   He then became more indignant, saying: The suggestion that I participated in any collusion or that I was aware of any collusion with the Russian government to hurt this country, which I have served with honor for 35 years, or to undermine the integrity of our democratic process, is an appalling and detestable lie. The attorney general has been dogged by implications of dishonesty and impropriety regarding his supposed contacts with the Russians since it became clear he neglected to mention meeting Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak at the Republican National Convention during his confirmation hearings. Some Democrats have even called for Sessions to resign over the matter. Intelligence Committee Vice Chairman Sen. Mark Warner ( ) opened the hearing imputing a possible additional meeting between Sessions and Kisylak at the Mayflower Hotel in April 2016. Sessions countered this suggestion. His prepared remarks insisted: I did not have any private meetings nor do I recall any conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel.  I did not attend any meetings at that event.  Prior to the speech, I attended a reception with my staff that included at least two dozen people and President Trump.  Though I do recall several conversations I had during that   reception, I do not have any recollection of meeting or talking to the Russian Ambassador or any other Russian officials.  If any brief interaction occurred in passing with the Russian Ambassador during that reception, I do not remember it.  After the speech, I was interviewed by the news media, which had gathered as I remember in a different room, and then I left the hotel. As for the confirmed meeting between the pair at the RNC, which became the basis of his alleged lie at his confirmation hearing, Sessions was equally unconvinced. There is the assertion that I did not answer Senator Frankens question honestly at my confirmation hearing.  Colleagues, that is false, Sessions said to his   fellow senators, smiling as he corrected himself. I cant say colleagues anymore        former colleagues.  This is what happened, Sessions continued: Senator Franken asked me a rambling question after some six hours of testimony that included dramatic, new allegations that the United States intelligence community, the U. S. intelligence community, had advised   Trump that there was a continuing exchange of information during the campaign between Trumps surrogates and intermediaries for the Russian government.  I was taken aback by that explosive allegation, which he said was being reported as breaking news that very day and which I had not heard. I wanted to refute     immediately     any suggestion that I was part of such activity. I replied, quote, Senator Franken, Im not aware of any of those activities.  I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didnt have     did not have communications with the Russians, and Im unable to comment on it, end quote. That was the context in which I was asked the question and in that context it was a fair and accurate response to the charge as I understood it. Session explicitly acknowledged the meetings between him an Kislyak, one at his Senate office and the other after a speech Sessions delivered at the RNC last July, but told the committee, Not one thing happened that was improper in any one of these meetings.  But Sessions also took issue with the entire idea his seeing the Russian ambassador had anything to do with the investigation into Russian election interference that ostensibly is the subject of Tuesdays hearing. Whether I ever attended a reception where the Russian Ambassador was also present is entirely beside the point of this investigation into Russian interference with the 2016 campaigns, he said."
NFL Network Warns Staffers to Steer Clear of Politics on Social Media,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/13/2017,"As more and more sports fans call for members of the sports media to stick to sports, news has leaked that the NFL Network is now warning employees to avoid talking about politics on their social media accounts. [While ESPN continues to spiral into pure   politics, the NFL Network seems ready to avoid the cable sports networks troubles, Sports Business Daily reported.  NFL executives are becoming alarmed by the volatility of mixing politics with sports and see it as a sort of   scenario.  So, network execs are saying avoid politics.  Those debates are healthy in the middle of newsrooms and discussions   NFL Networks executive producer of studio and remote content, Mike Muriano, said. But playfully or not, what happens in    conversations can be construed in ways that you dont want on a public forum like Twitter     especially when it comes to politics.  Execs essentially want employees to stick to sports.  One message the NFL gave its talent was to be cognizant that people follow them for their football knowledge. When in doubt, keep it to the game, NFLs vice president of social media and emerging programming, Tom Brady said. Theres always a time to showcase your personality and be able to engage with fans and go outside of your core. But at the end of the day, as a member of the NFL Media Group, try to stick to football because thats what people want to hear from you about.  Talent needs to be careful with that level of engagement, Muriano said. Be smart and sensitive to if youre getting trolled or not. Then just stop. Our talent, as the known quantity in this exchange, does not benefit by dressing down a fan     even if that fan is way off base. At some point, they have to know when to say that this has taken a turn and Im not taking part anymore.  There is a danger to unfiltered messages that can be delivered to a mass audience immediately. The league told its   talent to use common sense when posting on social media, the NFL Network told employees. Dont fail the social media IQ test, Muriano concluded. Is what youre about to put out there that important? Give it a second thought.  With the troubles of ESPN as a guide, it is no wonder that NFL Network execs want their employees to avoid the pitfalls of angering millions of customers with constant   political pronouncements.

Caitlyn Jenner Destroyed by Trumps Decision on Bathroom Privacy Rules - Breitbart,Breitbart,Robert J. Marlow,6/13/2017,"Americas favorite transexual Bruce Caitlyn Jenner finds recent decisions made by President Donald Trump regarding the LGBTQ community deeply disturbing. [The 1976 Olympic decathlon gold medal winner voted for Trump and feels more empathy for the GOP political philosophy than he does with the Democrat party, but Jenner considers the presidents decision to allow the states to determine rules for the use of student bathrooms and locker rooms by transgendered students a step backward.   When (Trump) pulled back on the Title IX (guidelines) it kind of killed   It destroyed me, said the former worlds most versatile athlete. This of all cases is when we need (the government) to step in. The bottom line is bullying in schools is going to be worse, and then theres already bullying online where theres no protection, no escape.  When you take away protection in schools, to be honest with you, it is devastating to these kids. These politicians say it is to protect their children in bathrooms. But young people will die. And they are transgender. Suicide rates will go up. What if thats your kid? The federal government is basically saying, you dont really exist. I was outspoken when Trump did that. And I should be.  Jenner still thinks it easier to show a Republican the error of his ways than try to reconstruct a Democrat:  For me, philosophically, Im on the Republican side. I have conservative views. But Im also trans.        I would much rather convince Republicans to do better with (LGBT) issues than to try to convince Democrats to lower taxes and have less regulations and less government. I work hard, mostly behind the scenes, to change (Republicans) views. When I sit down with Republican senators, theyll tell me theyve never met a trans person before and theyll mention their faith. I explain how faith has played a big part in what I have done and am doing right now. Just sitting at the table with someone, that can change peoples minds. USA Today reports that Jenners memoir includes a quote from Milton Diamond that says, Biology loves variation. Biology loves differences. Society hates it.  Diamond might not have meant that a male removing his genitalia demonstrates biological variation, but if the shoe fits   or, if the high heels fit   wear them."

NBA Champs Golden State Warriors Said to Be Mulling Rejection of Trump White House Visit,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/13/2017,"According to reports, NBA Champs the Golden State Warriors prepare to announce that they will refuse the offer to visit President Trump at the White House to celebrate their Championship win this year. [Apparently the Warriors met not long after winning the NBA championship and decided unanimously not to accept the invitation to visit the White House, according to AJC. com.  The move may not come as a surprise since several Warriors have publicly criticized President Trump. In February, for instance, the Hill reported that Stephen Curry denigrated the president as something less than an asset: NBA MVP Stephen Curry of the Golden State Warriors insulted Trump in a recent interview with the Mercury News, saying the president is an asset if you remove the et.  Warriors coach Steve Kerr has also been heard attacking president Trump. The news breaks only a day after the Clemson Tigers visited the White House to celebrate their January win over Alabama to clinch the NCAA National Championship. Despite the news appearing widely in sports media the Warriors insist that no such decision to skip the White House visit has been made. According to the AP: The Warriors issued a statement Tuesday saying that today is all about celebrating our championship and that they have not received an invitation to the White House. The statement added the organization would make those decisions when and if necessary.

DELINGPOLE: Global Warming Study Cancelled Because of Unprecedented Ice,Breitbart,James Delingpole,6/13/2017,"A global warming research study in Canada has been cancelled because of unprecedented thick summer ice. [Naturally, the scientist in charge has blamed it on climate change.  According to Vice: The study, entitled BaySys, is a $     program headed by the University of Manitoba. It was planning to conduct the third leg of its research by sending 40 scientists from five Canadian universities out into the Bay on the Canadian Research Icebreaker CCGS Amundsen to study contributions of climate change and regulation on the Hudson Bay system.  But it had to be cancelled because the scientists icebreaker was required by the Canadian Coast Guard for a rather more urgent purpose     rescuing fishing boats and supply ships which had got stuck in the unprecedented ice conditions. It became clear to me very quickly that these werent just heavy ice conditions, these were unprecedented ice conditions, Dr. David Barber, the lead scientist on the study, told VICE. We were finding thick   sea ice floes which on level ice were five metres thick       it was much, much thicker and much, much heavier than anything you would expect at that latitude and at that time of year.  Clearly not one to let a crisis go to waste, Barber seized the opportunity to perform the usual alarmist clown dance for the media, explaining why this incident definitely shows that global warming is a major problem and deserving of our urgent attention. He told Vice: It was clear it was from the Arctic, I just needed to be among the ice to see it, said Dr. Barber. What was also clear to me was that climate change has caused this event to happen.  [Dont you just love that I just needed to be among the ice? I think what hes trying in his subtle way to tell us is: Not all superheroes wear capes] Warming to his theme, he told Global News: This is climate change fully in action     affecting our ability to make use of marine resources and transport things.  and, This is a   call for all of us in the country.  Of course it is. Now Barber has the perfect excuse to share his war stories with all the other global warming experts who have had their research   stunts stymied by unseasonal bouts of global warming. There was the Ship of Fools expedition in which an Australian climate researcher called Chris Turkey had to call an expedition to the melting Antarctic after his ship got stuck in the ice. The Caitlin Expedition     supported by the Prince of Wales     in which Pen Haddow and his team had to abandon their trip to the North Pole because it was colder than theyd expected. Most recently there was Ship of Fools II, in which a global warming research voyage by David Hempleman Adams had to be curtailed because of unexpected ice. What on earth can Mother Gaia be trying to tell them? Possibly the same message shes trying to send out to the Greenies in California with this unexpected fall of white global warming. Why, if you didnt know better youd almost think unseasonal bouts of snow and ice were nothing to do with global warming but were a natural phenomenon which had been with us since time immemorial      ."

Schiff Complains Nunes Unmasking Oversight Is Not Helpful to the Russian Investigation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/13/2017,".@RepAdamSchiff weighs in on Devin Nunes role in Russia investigation #morningjoe pic. twitter.  Tuesday on MSNBCs Morning Joe, Rep. Adam Schiff ( ) the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said his counterpart on the committee chairman Rep. Devin Nunes ( ) had no completely absolved himself from the committees investigation into allegations the Russian government interfered in the 2016 presidential election.  Nunes had recused himself earlier this year. However, Schiff said he was still insisting on signing off on subpoenas and that he was conducting oversight into the unmasking of American citizens in raw intelligence in a way that was not helpful to the Russia investigation. Partial transcript as follows: MICHAEL SCHMIDT, THE NEW YORK TIMES: Congressman, what role is Devin Nunes, the member of your committee, playing in the investigation? He had said he was going to step aside and then there were some     some notion that maybe he was still signing subpoenas and playing a role in the investigation. How involved is he, and does that concern you? SCHIFF: Well, his only involvement in the Russia investigation, but it does concern me, is that he is still insisting on signing off on the subpoenas in the Russia investigation. That authority, by our rules, can be delegated to Mr. Conaway with consultation with myself. Thats what should have been done by now. It hasnt been done. So that does concern me. JOE SCARBOROUGH: Why     why hasnt it been done? SCHIFF: He simply refuses at this point. SCARBOROUGH: But     but     but you mean even related to the Russian investigation? SCHIFF: Yes. Yes. SCARBOROUGH: But he recused himself. SCHIFF: Well     exactly. SCARBOROUGH: But     but isnt that     isnt that one of the most important aspects of     MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Questions     SCARBOROUGH: Of running an investigation, the power to subpoena witnesses? SCHIFF: It absolutely is. And its indefensible. You know, the only thing I can say is, thus far we have only sought to issue four subpoenas. He did sign off on them, but its still inexcusable that hes ultimately a check on what the Russia investigation can do. BRZEZINSKI: Yes. SCHIFF: The other part of it is, theres this unmasking oversight going on. That is something that he is conducting. And I think some of the timing of what he has done there has been designed is helping propagate the administrations message in a way that is not helpful to the Russia investigation.

"Police: 2 officers killed, 2 inmates on run in Georgia",CNN,Devon M. Sayers,6/13/2017,"(CNN) Two prisoners involved in the fatal shootings of two corrections officers on a bus Tuesday morning in central Georgia apparently have ditched their prison uniforms for stolen clothes.  An expanding manhunt is underway for Donnie Russell Rowe, 43, and Ricky Dubose, 24. They were on a state corrections bus with 31 other inmates about 6:45 a. m. when the pair somehow got out of what should have been a locked, gated rear section of the bus, officials said. Rowe and Dubose entered the drivers compartment and overpowered and disarmed Officers Christopher Monica and Curtis Billue while the bus was on State Route 16 between Eatonton and Sparta, Putnam County Sheriff Howard Sills said.  At least one of the prisoners shot and killed Monica and Billue, Sills said. They may be armed with the officers Glock pistols. Investigators will analyze footage from video cameras on the bus to determine how they got free and who pulled the trigger, the sheriff said. But as long as the suspects are missing, he called the matter of who opened fire immaterial for now. They are dangerous beyond description, Sills told reporters Tuesday. They need to surrender before we find them.  Sills said later the duo had ransacked a random house, took some food and may have stolen some clothes. The sheriff said there was no reason to believe the two have split. I have their blood on my shoes Rowe and Dubose carjacked an approaching green 2004   Honda Civic with Georgia license plate RBJ6601. After forcing the driver out, the two drove west toward Eatonton, Sills said. Dubose had a prior arrest in the area but no family connections, the sheriff said. Monica, 42, and Billue, 58, were transporting the inmates from Hancock State Prison, in adjacent Hancock County, to the Georgia Diagnostic and Classification Prison, some 45 miles west of Eatonton, Georgia Department of Corrections Commissioner Greg Dozier said. Rowe and Dubose most recently were inmates at Baldwin State Prison in nearby Milledgeville, the corrections department said. It wasnt immediately clear why or for how long they were at the Hancock prison, or why they were being taken to the diagnostic prison. The other prisoners were still on the bus, with doors closed, when authorities arrived at the scene, he said. The sheriff was emotional as he recounted what he saw when he arrived on the scene. I saw two brutally murdered corrections officers thats what I saw, Sill said. I have their blood on my shoes.  Reward offered, Gov. Nathan Deal said the state will use all available resources to track the fugitives down.  Today, two families lost everything in a heinous and senseless act of violence perpetrated at the hands of cowards, Deal said. Our heartbreak is matched only in our resolve to bring their murderers to justice. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation (GBI) has raised the reward to $70, 000 from $60, 000, according to their verified Twitter account.  The sheriff of Oconee County, whose jurisdiction is north of where the killings occurred, wrote a post on Facebook to the escaped convicts.  Donnie and Ricky, I hope you are reading this. What is done is done. However, I am asking you to surrender yourselves to the nearest law enforcement officer as soon as possible. You made your escape, but you wont be out long. . .. There is no one you can trust . .. and nowhere you can go that we wont find you, the sheriff wrote. Bus was going from one prison to another, It is standard protocol to have two officers    armed but not wearing ballistic vests    transport prisoners on a bus, said Dozier with GDOC. Monica, a sergeant, worked for the department for almost eight years and leaves a wife. Billue, a   employee, is survived by a father, a brother and a sister, Dozier said. Rowe, who is 6 feet 1 inches tall and 181 pounds with blue eyes and brown hair, was serving a sentence of up to life in prison for armed robbery and aggravated assault in a 2001 case, according to the Georgia Department of Corrections website. Dubose, 6 feet 1 inches tall and 140 pounds with blue eyes and brown hair, was sentenced up to 20 years in prison for armed robbery, aggravated assault and theft in 2014, the website shows. He also was convicted of theft and identity fraud in cases from August 2010. The other prisoners on the bus were taken to the sheriffs office where about 3 p. m. some of them were put on another corrections department bus. Two guards with long guns watched as the prisoners, wearing cuffs on their ankles and wrists, shuffled toward the transport. Eatonton, Putnam Countys seat of government, is about 65 miles southeast of Atlanta."
Katy Perry and the gospel of Witness,CNN,Hunter Schwarz,6/13/2017,"(CNN) To promote her new album Witness, Katy Perry has been live streaming her life on YouTube 24 hours a day since Thursday from a home in Los Angeles. Ive found myself surprisingly captivated, tuning in throughout the weekend to watch her get her makeup done, be interviewed, and even sleep. There were plenty of political moments, like an interview with activist DeRay McKesson Saturday and a dinner last night that included guests Caitlyn Jenner, and CNN commentators Van Jones, Ana Navarro and Sally Kohn. To anyone vaguely familiar with Katys politics, there was nothing particularly surprising    shes aggressively earnest and compassionately liberal    but what struck me was the missionary zeal with which the former Christian singer takes her politics. The Washington Post called her album  . During the live stream she almost like a convert, newly aware of social injustice and privilege, having faced blowback for controversies like wearing cornrows in her music video for the song This Is How We Do or making a joke referencing Britney Spears breakdown seen as insensitive to those with mental health problems. I listened and I heard and I didnt know, she said during a podcast interview with McKesson, the activist. I will never understand some of those things because of who I am, but, I can educate myself, and thats what Im trying to do along the way. Witness isnt just the name of her album, its a way of life.  She said during the livestream she wants to be an active witness, she talked frequently about how she has political disagreements with her parents but still loves them and listens to them, she atoned for her insensitive and politically incorrect comments in the past (The whole world is keeping me accountable and I hope that we can keep each other accountable, with compassion) and she wished everyone well, from   makeup artists who seemed a little too thirsty in their sudden proximity to celebrity to even Taylor Swift.  God bless you on your journey, she would say time and time again. Ive previously called Katy the Hillary Clinton of pop, and this seemed like a continuation of that,   on Clintons campaign message of stronger together and love and kindness. Shes also someone who can be extremely transparent in what influences her, following fellow pop stars or the latest Internet memes a little too closely or a little too late. After Lady Gaga stunned the VMAs with multiple flashy costume changes during the 2010 show (the meat dress was just one of her looks that night) Katy did her own version of the multiple costume change at the 2011 VMAs. But it felt like a stale stunt, ~reductive~ if you will, and Gaga spent entirety of the 2011 show in drag, dressed as her   Jo Calderone.  I remember thinking at the time Katy felt late to the party, left in the dust.  Even as Katy follows her political icon, Clinton herself has moved on.  Stronger Together didnt win an election, and Clinton these days is often throwing punches and willing to pick fights. Katy seems stuck in 2016, promoting an album with love and kindness even as critics pan the record and her pop rival Swift plays petty, dropping her entire discography on streaming services perhaps to steal the spotlight. But Katy seemed unbothered by any outside storm, eternally optimistic, and driven by her mission.  I want to spread love and hope and kindness to all the people of the world, she said."
Could football help ease tensions between North and South Korea?,CNN,James Griffiths,6/13/2017,"(CNN) Tensions in northeast Asia are among their highest in decades, amid continued missile testing by Pyongyang and   from Tokyo, Beijing and Washington.  Could sport be the solution? South Korean President Moon   apparently thinks so. In discussions with FIFA President Gianni Infantino this week, the South Korean President suggested  a regional bloc including both Koreas, China and Japan could join forces to host the 2030 football World Cup.  A jointly hosted tournament could help create peace between the South and North and in the northeast region, Moon said, according to a spokesman.  He also suggested it could lead to a European   security and economic partnership between countries in the region.  Heightened tensions, If Moon were to achieve his vision, it would require a difficult balancing act.  Since his election in May, Moon has been trying to improve relations between Pyongyang and Seoul, amid a heightened security situation on the peninsula and   North Korean missile testing.  While Moon has said he would be willing to visit Pyongyang and meet with Kim Jong Un, last week North Korea rejected an offer by a South Korean civic group to provide   supplies, the first   exchange approved by Seoul since January 2016.  Throwing cold water on hopes from many in Moons circle for improved   relations, Pyongyang said it wouldnt allow the visit due to new UN sanctions against it that South Korea supported.  Moon has also struggled to patch up things with China, which was angered when Moons predecessor approved the deployment of a US missile defense system in South Korea. Further   of the THAAD system has been delayed by Moons administration pending an environmental assessment.  Even South   relations arent particularly positive, amid an ongoing dispute between Seoul and Tokyo over   comfort women held by the Japanese imperial army during World War II.  Sporting culture, Despite their longstanding differences    the two countries are still technically at war    South and North Korea have a strong shared footballing history.  The two teams regularly play each other in friendlies and at international competitions. In April, South Koreas womens soccer team traveled to Pyongyang for an Asian Cup qualifier. Footballing culture is strong in the two Koreas. North Korea has qualified for the World Cup more times than China, a country with a population 54 times larger, while South Koreas national football team is the most successful in Asia.  However, not all sporting overtures have been successful. Pyongyang boycotted the 1988 Olympics, held in Seoul, after negotiations for the two countries to potential sharing hosting duties broke down.  Strong message FIFAs Infantino welcomed Moons suggestion this week, adding that while there could be difficulties in achieving his goal, it is important to make such an effort based on belief.  It could send a strong message just by mentioning such a vision, Infantino said, adding that he would bring up the matter with Chinese President Xi Jinping at a meeting later this week.  International diplomacy aside, northeast Asia is well situated for the World Cup. South Korea, Japan and China all have extensive sporting facilities    South Korea and Japan   the successful 2002 World Cup, the first time the tournament was held in Asia. Beijing hosted the 2008 Olympics, while Tokyo is due to host the 2020 games.  If the three countries, along with North Korea, put forward a joint bid, it would likely be a compelling one, without the need for extensive stadium development as in Qatar, which is hosting the 2022 World Cup.  However, even if Moon manages to thread the diplomatic needles, his vision will also face strong opposing bids from the UK, and Uruguay and Argentina, which are putting forward a joint bid to host the tournament on the hundredth anniversary of the inaugural World Cup in Uruguay."
Warriors dethrone Cavs for 2nd title in 3 years,CNN,Jill Martin,6/13/2017,"(CNN) Kevin Durant joined the Golden State Warriors to win his first NBA championship. Mission accomplished.  The Warriors defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers   in Game 5 of the NBA Finals, clinching their second title in three years and their fifth in team history, avenging the loss to Cleveland after blowing a   lead a year ago. Durant led Golden State with 39 points, seven rebounds and five assists and was named NBA Finals MVP in a unanimous vote. He scored 30 or more points in all five Finals games.  I couldnt sleep for two days, Durant told reporter Doris Burke. I was anxious. I was jittery. I just wanted to lay it all out there. Following Mondays win, he embraced his mother, Wanda Durant, on the court. Im proud of you, son, she said. Said Stephen Curry of his teammate: The way that he embraced the opportunity in The Finals, it was unbelievable. Durant: Its all about the group This was the first time in NBA history the same two teams met in the NBA Finals for a third straight time. The Warriors won the title in 2015 in six games, while the Cavaliers dramatically won in 2016 in seven, becoming the first team in NBA history to win a series trailing  . Durant, who famously called his mom the real MVP when he won the NBA MVP Award in 2014, knew what it felt like to lose a   lead    and losing to LeBron James. In the 2012 NBA Finals, Durant was playing for the Oklahoma City Thunder and lost to James    who was then with the Miami Heat    in five games. After the Cavaliers won the title in 2016, Golden States focus turned to a player who wasnt in the NBA Finals: Durant. He was entering free agency after the Thunder gave away a   lead against the Warriors in the Western Conference finals. It spurred the most frenzy surrounding an NBA free agent decision since James announced in 2014 that he would return to the Cavaliers after spending four seasons with the Heat. With a superstar in Durant teaming with another in Curry    as well as with Draymond Green and Klay Thompson    it made Golden State a super team. The only unknown was if the team chemistry would be disrupted with Durants addition. The answer: An emphatic no. The group was close to unstoppable in the regular season and postseason. While the Warriors didnt surpass their NBA record of 73   from 2016 (they settled for 67 this year) they still had the NBAs best   record. Golden State went   in this years playoffs, good for the highest winning percentage (. 941) in a single postseason, surpassing the Los Angeles Lakers from 2001 (  . 938). Twelve of the Warriors 16 playoff wins this postseason were by double digits. Not only could Durant coexist with Curry and the rest of the Warriors, but they also thrived. I hear all the narratives throughout the season that I was joining, I was hopping on bandwagons, I was letting everybody else do the work, Durant said. But then that was far from the truth. I came in and tried to help my team. Like I said, tried to be myself, be aggressive and sacrifice as well. Theres some games I might not get shots, as many shots as Im used to getting. Some games where Steph is going to go off and hit 13 threes or Klay might hit 60 or Draymond might get a   with no points. But nobody cared, as long as we won. Andre Iguodala, who is right there, he continued to preach that every single day. Its all about the group. If your intentions are good, then that means as a team that were moving in the right direction. So I just tried to think about that, but also add my flair to the game. And it feels amazing to win a championship with these guys. I cant wait to celebrate for the rest of the night    well, maybe the rest of the summer. To go with Durants numbers on Monday night, Curry had 34 points, 10 assists and six rebounds. Iguodala added 20 points. Green had 10 points and 12 rebounds, and Thompson had 11 points. You got a bunch of guys who are talented and can shoot and pass and dribble, and theyre unselfish, Warriors head coach Steve Kerr said. There was never any question in my mind that this was going to work. So, this is the culmination of a year where they grew together and learned each others games and got better and better all year, and it was just phenomenal to be part of. Kerr: Tonight was a little different  The Warriors also did much of this without their head coach on the sideline for an extended period of this postseason. Kerr coached the first two games of Golden States   playoff series against the Portland Trail Blazers in April but stepped away because he was experiencing complications from back surgery from two years ago. During his absence, Kerr was still involved at practice, but he handed the game day responsibilities to assistant coach Mike Brown. Golden State went   during that stretch before Kerr returned for Game 2 of the NBA Finals. This is Kerrs seventh championship, five of those as a player and two as a head coach. Kerr is the fourth coach in NBA history to win two championships in his first three seasons, joining Phil Jackson (1991, 1992) Bill Russell (1968, 1969) and John Kundla (1949, 1950) according to the Elias Sports Bureau. He was seen tearing up after the game. Winning is fantastic, Kerr said. Ive been so lucky to be part of so many championship teams as a player and now as a coach, and it never gets old. But tonight was a little different, just based on the things Ive had to go through during this time. James: Golden State built to last a few years Mondays loss denied the Cavaliers a chance to repeat as champions and for James to get his fourth championship ring. It was his seventh consecutive trip to the NBA Finals, the only   Celtic to do so. It also kept the Cavaliers from becoming the first team in NBA history to come back from trailing   to win a    series. As far as that team, theyre going to be here for a while, James said of the Warriors. Theyre going to be around for a while. Pretty much all their   guys are in their 20s, and they dont show any signs of slowing down. So theres going to be a lot of teams thats trying to figure out ways to put personnel together to try and match that if theyre able to actually face them in the playoff series, both Eastern Conference and Western Conference. Because theyre built for    from my eyes, theyre built to last a few years. James finished with 41 points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and two steals. He averaged a triple double during the NBA Finals. I left everything on the floor every game, all five games, James said. So for me personally, I have no reason to put my head down. Kyrie Irving had 26 points while JR Smith had 25. I broke down, so I couldnt really finish my speech, Cavaliers head coach Tyronn Lue said. A lot of guys cried because they wanted it bad. And thats all you can ask. If you give all your effort and all the fight and all the heart you got, it doesnt necessarily mean youre going to win, and thats whats tough about sports. I credit our guys. I thought they gave everything they had, and we fought, we competed, and we never gave in, but they beat us."
Do you need to be Korean to be K-pop?,CNN,Marian Liu,6/13/2017,"(CNN) Can Korean pop music still be considered Korean if it no longer features any Koreans?  According to EXP Edition    the first   group to be made up entirely of      the answer is yes.  But not everyone agrees.  In the notoriously micromanaged world of   where genuine controversies are rare, the emergence of the born in New York, made in Seoul group has led to heated debates around issues of authenticity and identity. What divides pop from   is the K, said   David Kim, who runs the popular   Youtube channel DKDKTV.  Obviously, you could tell they (EXP Edition) were not Korean, without even seeing their appearance, added Kim, who likened their accents and style to Coldplay.  His channels subscribers, who number more than fourty thousand, have so far agreed. Videos of the   group have become a lightning rod for fan anger, with thousands posting their disapproval.  At the center of this furor is the issue of race. Critics say not only are the band   they are foreign intruders who are taking over what was supposed to be a safe space for Asians artists.  Its really interesting that a crew from America is trying to figure out how to, essentially, hack the   market, said Tamar Herman, who covers   for Billboard. com.  They have definitely figured out what it is that   fans like       talented men singing and performing sleek choreography. But, for many in the   fan community, perfect complexions and polished dance moves are not enough.   I dont think they really count as   because they dont fit into any of the existing parameters of what   is, said Herman.  First white   group, Although EXP Edition is not the first to feature      groups like GOT7 and UNIQ include Chinese members in addition to their Korean ones    they are the first to feature white members.  I never imagined getting this kind of backlash from people for just doing  said EXP Edition member ime Kota. I honestly love and enjoy being a part of  . . .. I hope people see our energy and our music, and dont just limit everything to our nationality. Kota, who is Croatian, is one of three white members of the group, alongside Frankie Daponte Jr (Portuguse American from Rhode Island) and Hunter Kohl (American from New York). The groups fourth member   Koki Tomlinson is    . All four are in their  .  They released their first single last month, the dual    Feel LIke This, which failed to chart, and are preparing to release a second single this summer, followed by an album.  While theyve provoked debate, its not clear whether the group are having any commercial success. They raised $30, 600 via a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 before their arrival in Seoul in 2016. As for where the money to cover their living costs comes from, the group have been cagey, offering only that they have investors, without giving further details.   An experiment EXP is an abbreviation of the word  experiment, a literal play on the groups origins as a student project exploring global culture and identity.  I was thinking about cultural flow, originality, hybridity and appropriation, said Bora Kim, 34, who came up with the idea of forming a   pop act while completing a Masters of Fine Arts at Columbia University.  Three years ago, the Seoul native held auditions for a documentary about becoming a   star. Thousands showed up for six available spots. Last year, under the guidance of Kim, four chosen finalists moved to Seoul to pursue her dream.  A   fan since her youth, Kims primary criteria when selecting members of the group was talent.  We actually made them do a lot of things in the audition, sing pop songs, see if they could act. We asked if theyre okay with wearing a lot of makeup and we expected them to perform. Kim teamed up with Karin Kuroda, whom she met at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, to create an entertainment company in Seoul, called IMMABB Entertainment (It stands for: Im making a boy band).  As a fellow   fan, Kuroda was also eager to explore the genres racial dynamics. The    was born in Switzerland, of Japanese descent, and grew up in New York. No role models, Koki Tomlinson, the groups only Asian member felt the same way. There are no Asian pop icons in America, in acting or music or anything like that. I didnt have anybody to look up to when growing up . .. So, this was an opportunity for me to do pop, because the chance is not available in the states right now. But race is not the only issue confronting EXP.   Many fans, such as YouTube fan channel administrator Kim, maintain the biggest difference is training.    stars are never discovered   instead, they are carefully created from a young age, under the watchful supervision of record labels. During this period, they undergo a period of rigorous training, preparing the artists for a life in the spotlight.  (The band) is offensive to towards hardcore   fans who know their groups have gone through a lot of pain, said Kim.   Nevertheless, EXP describe their own training as intensive, often putting in up to eight hours a day, six days a week, with extra Korean classes on top.  Kohl said they are now doing interviews and TV segments in Korean, but still have a long way to go. On June 20, they will be featured on a variety show that follows the lives of foreigners in South Korea,My Neighbor, Charles. They were also invited to the largest music and arts festival in Denmark, Roskilde Festival, happening June 28 to July 1.  It was interesting that a conversation was created about what people think defines a genre of music, said leader Daponte. I see music as a universal language that brings all people together."

Russia cloud settles in over White House,CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/12/2017,"Washington (CNN) The Russia cloud is growing over President Donald Trump and threatening to wreck another week for the embattled White House as one of his closest allies tries to avoid a public spectacle on Capitol Hill. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announcement that he would testify before Senate Russia investigators caught everyone    including the intelligence committee    by surprise. Now, before he even testifies, the focus is both on Sessions and whether or not he would appear before the TV cameras like former FBI Director James Comey did last week, when 19. 5 million Americans watched. RELATED: Source: Sessions plans to testify surprised Senate intelligence panel members, Trump team has struggled to move the focus away from Russia. The White House is hoping this week to drive a message focused on his agenda. His daughter and top adviser, Ivanka Trump, is leading events focused on workforce development and college affordability. But Russia    and Trumps own tweeting    threaten to swallow that effort whole, much like last weeks largely forgotten Infrastructure Week. In addition to Sessions possible testimony, the question remains whether or not Trump taped his conversations with Comey. The President himself tweeted early Sunday morning touting his economic record.  The #FakeNews MSM doesnt report the great economic news since Election Day. #DOW up 16%. #NASDAQ up 19. 5%, Trump wrote in the first of two tweets. Minutes later, Trump demonstrated the White Houses messaging problem, immediately shifting to Comey and kicking off another news cycle: I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal? Very cowardly!   Adding to the tension for the White House are   deadlines in Congress to approve a health care bill before a September 30 deadline and agree on a tax reform plan    both top campaign promises, which appear to be longshots.  Trumps chief White House liaison to the Hill, Marc Short, admitted last week in a call with reporters that Russia questions had sucked much of the oxygen out of the room. Sessions: Will he or wont he? The attorney general is coming off a disastrous week of his own. After the White House wouldnt give Sessions a   public endorsement, Comey told senators that Sessions may have had a third, undisclosed meeting with the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak. RELATED: If there are tapes, can the White House be forced to turn them over? He had been scheduled to answer questions before the House and Senate spending committees Tuesday, but instead wants to show up to the intelligence committee instead. That possibility could mean a closed hearing, unlike the drama of last Thursday with Comey. In an odd twist for Congress, senior members of the Senate intelligence committee were unsure if Sessions would even be allowed to appear. I dont know whether it will happen    dont know whether its going to be public, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat, told CNNs Brianna Keilar on State of the Union Sunday. Feinstein, who used to chair the Senate intelligence committee and is the top Democrat on the Senate judiciary committee, tossed a curveball back at the attorney general, arguing he should testify publicly before the seasoned lawyers and prosecutors of the Judiciary Committee. I challenge the jurisdiction, to some extent. Im on both committees, as you know, she said. There is an opportunity to look at the law with respect to obstruction of justice, to hold a hearing, and also to have those relevant people come before the judiciary committee. Meanwhile, behind the scenes, Democrats on the Senate intelligence committee believe Sessions is trying to use their venue to duck public scrutiny. Sen. Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat on the committee, who pressed Comey last week on why Sessions was involved in his firing if he had recused himself, argued that Sessions had no reason to seek a classified briefing. The American people also deserve to hear the attorney generals answers to these questions, as well as others related to his meetings with the Russians and his failure to disclose those meetings to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Wyden wrote Sunday in a letter to intelligence panel leaders. None of this needs be classified. The test comes as special counsel Robert Mueller appears to be ramping up his probe    hiring away a handful of seasoned federal criminal investigators that could hint at deeper, more serious legal trouble for Trump and his team. Meanwhile, Trumps own Russia team, led by Marc Kasowitz, brought on veteran Republican communicator Mark Corallo, a former spokesman to   General John Ashcroft who is steeped in crisis communications from his time helping defend Karl Rove in the midst of Valerie Plame case. Moving on? Trumps allies attempted to move the national storyline away from Russia on the Sunday talk shows, arguing that Comeys testimony about former Attorney General Loretta Lynch to call the Hillary Clinton email investigation a matter was more compelling. Im calling for an end to the investigations about the President Trumps campaign colluding with the Russians. Theres been no evidence of it. I dont think that should continue, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel said on Fox News Sunday. But even Republicans in the Capitol have continued pressing for answers in the Russia probes. Senate judiciary committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Feinstein formally requested Comeys memos of his meeting with Trump from Comeys friend Daniel Richman. House Russia investigators, led by Texas Republican Rep. Michael Conaway and California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, sent a formal request to the White House for any records of Trumps private meetings with Comey."
Equality marchers push for progress on LGBT rights,CNN,Paul P. Murphy,6/12/2017,"Washington (CNN) Dont think because they won marriage equality in 2015 they would rest easy.  The LGBT community came out en masse in Washington for the Equality March, pressing the new White House to continue progress made by the previous administration. The march Sunday was vibrant, in attire and color.   There were rainbow pride flags, trans pride flags, even American and Puerto Rican flags with rainbows as their stripes. The energy was palpable, even as they lined up sporadic cheers would overtake the crowd, interrupting percussive protest chants. And then it suddenly got quiet.  Soft singing soon overtook the soft fluttered of flags in the breeze, Oh, say can you see. ..  The national anthem. More and more joined the chorus as the song neared its apex, roaring towards the final lines. As it concluded, the crowds let up a thunderous cheer.  The march had begun. Wayne Pawlowski and Ted carried one of those bright rainbow pride flags near the front of the parade.  Ted declined to give CNN his full name he knows that his marriage and his sexual orientation could get him fired. Wayne and Ted have been together for 35 years, married for nine of them. Ted, like three out of five Americans according to the Human Rights Campaign, could be fired simply for being gay.  Theres a lot of basic rights that we as gay people dont have that a lot of Americans do and take for granted, said Ted.  We need to change that. But Ted, 62, and Pawlowski, 71, have a unique historical artifact     their rainbow pride flag.   They flew it at the capitals first ever LGBT protest on October 14, 1979.  And theyve brought it to every single Pride celebration and protest theyve ever gone to since.   Jasmine and Nette Archangel made the trip North from Louisiana to be here     they brought their whole family.  For them, the march was about being visible. We want our family to be normalized, not just tolerated, said Nette, 32.  Our familys made out of love.   Last year, the couple made a big move from rural Louisiana into New Orleans, a place they feel more accepted.   Jasmine, 33, is a bit more shy.  I want my sons to know no matter what they decide to do, we love them regardless, she says through a smile.   The Archangels werent the only family to travel from Louisiana.  Erin Crisham and Monica Herbert brought their    son Cullen to the march.   We want to make sure that voices are still being heard, said Crisham.  Legislation continues to progress and not stall.  Crisham, like many in the community, saw a number of LGBT rights victories.  Now, with a new President at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, they want to maintain that progress.   We dont want to see anything stay stagnant, she said.  We dont want to see anything take steps back.  We really want to see things continue to move forward. The community won those   victories by the grassroots organizing of their organizations.  They rapidly and fundamentally shifted American public thought on a variety of LGBT issues by coming out     to their families, friends and coworkers     and pressuring their politicians. So how will the community pressure continued progress on LGBT issues in President Donald Trumps America? Theyll stay involved and start at home, just like they always did.  Crisham and Herbet are going to work with local LGBT family organizations     just like the Archangels.  And they agree with the Archangels their family needs to be treated like anyone elses. She says sometimes people just arent used to having different types of families around them.  Its a matter of getting them used to it.    Sometimes, were the educators for that, she said.  For Ted, its simple.  Hes going to make sure hes at the ballot box each election voting for   candidates, whenever we can.   His husband Wayne is going to support the organizations that helped make marriage equality the law of the land.   We are going to go back to Florida tomorrow, he said.  The first thing were going to do is send more donations (supportive organizations including Human Rights Campaign and the American Civil Liberties Union) . .. the organizations that fight for us in ways that we cant individually. Clayton Whitehead, 29, agrees.  He sprained his ankle playing flag football earlier in the week but did not let that, or the crutch he has to walk with, stop him from marching.   The march was, only the beginning.   We have to get involved at the local level, he says.  Have the courage to speak up.  Go to your community meetings.  Your council meetings.  Vote in your local elections.  Those are just as important as our national elections. Lou and John Thompson, both 69, came to Washington from Conway, Arkansas, for their first Pride and their first political protest.   They held a sign that reads, We love our (single) gay son!  Their son Brocks sign read, I love my (annoying but  ) straight parents!  We need to make a stand at times, said Thompson, who thinks now is not the time to be silent. In our churches. City council.  Just every little opportunity that you get to make a stand, I think you need to say something. Brock Thompson agrees. Were going to march every day if we need to, he says, beaming."

Two Million Americans Drop Out of Obamacare Since Signing Up in January - Breitbart,Breitbart,Sean Moran,6/12/2017,"Two million Americans withdrew from Obamacare insurance plans since signing up on a federal exchange in January. [On Monday, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published two reports detailing that nearly two million Americans had not paid their insurance premiums to maintain health insurance coverage.  The Effectuated Enrollment Report explains that 12. 2 million Americans selected an Obamacare plan at the end of the open enrollment period. However, only 10. 3 million decided to pay the required premiums to maintain health insurance coverage as of March 15th. CMS Administrator Seema Verma explained, Consumers are sending a clear message that cost and affordability are major factors in their decision to cancel or terminate coverage.  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price explained that Americans face less affordable health insurance options under the Affordable Care Act. Price said: Not surprisingly, as costs continue to go up, fewer Americans can afford to pay more and get less for healthcare. Many individuals and families across the country are tired of having their healthcare options dictated to them by Washington     particularly when those limited options are unaffordable. Thats why every day we are working on behalf of President Trump on solutions that will show a little humility from the federal government, equip states to serve their unique and diverse populations, and put healthcare decisions in the hands of patients, families, and their doctors. House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) issued a statement, condemning the continued collapse of Obamacare. He said: These reports are further proof that Americans dont want to buy what Obamacare is selling: expensive insurance that fails to meet their health care needs. So far this year, nearly 2 million more people didnt keep their coverage through Obamacares individual insurance marketplace     in large part because of doubling premiums, dwindling choices, and less access to the care thats right for them. As the Senate moves forward with our effort to repeal and replace this failing law, the House is continuing to take action this week with legislation that will protect and expand access to affordable, quality health care options for our veterans, workers, and families. Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price commented on the fewer choices that Americans now face under the Affordable Care Act. Price said, Not surprisingly, as costs continue to go up, fewer Americans can afford to pay more and get less for healthcare.

"ZUMWALT: On Anniversary of Reagans Tear Down This Wall Speech, Radical Islam Trumps Great Challenge - Breitbart",Breitbart,James Zumwalt,6/12/2017,"Thirty years ago today, President Ronald Reagan gave one of the most moving motivational speeches to people who had long lived under the yoke of communism. While he spoke in Berlin, Germany, his speech was broadcast internationally and, thus, so too was his message. [He paid tribute to the character of the West Berliners who had endured the destruction of World War II, emerging from their   shelters to build their city and nation anew, albeit a divided city and nation. Able to seek their greatest potential under the protective shadow of the U. S. and with the generosity of the Marshall Plan, West Berliners     like the fabled Phoenix rising out of the ashes of destruction     turned want into abundance.  Reagan spoke within sight of the Brandenberg Gate   the passageway through the great wall separating the city where Checkpoint Charlie was situated providing guarded access between   East and U. S.  West Berlin. The Gate provided the linchpin in competing Cold War interests. Its peaceful removal would bring a     conflict to an end. At the time of Reagans speech, there was still uncertainty about Soviet intentions and if its leader in 1987, Mikahil Gorbachev, would take his country down a more, or less, aggressive path in Cold War relations. Accordingly, Reagan called for a sign of true Soviet intentions by demanding, Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this Wall     a demand that met with cheers from his audience. Interestingly, several of the points Reagan made in his 1987 speech are just as applicable today in the face of a new and perhaps greater threat. Instead of communism, it is now Islamism threatening us. And that threat is greater, for a big difference exists between the two ideologies. While communist leaders always acted tethered to the reality of ensuring their own survival, Islamist leaders do not. The great liberty that nurtured success and abundance in Germany and elsewhere in Europe following World War II flourished as the dictatorial restraints that once contained it no longer did so. Sadly, such liberty is   in   countries today, constrained by chains on creative thinking imposed by both the Quran and sharia. Reagan extended a challenge to the Soviets to tear down a wall dividing their two ideologies, one allowing prosperity for people subjected to it the other denying such prosperity. Historically, undemocratic Muslim nations have failed to flourish economically in part due to the absence of liberties empowering their people to do so. This stems from one basic flaw, not of Islamism, but of Islam itself. It is the belief that those who have accepted Islam deserve superior treatment to   some of whom   such as the Jews   are declared to not exist as humans but are descendants of apes and pigs.  The implementation of this belief is most glaring in the imposition by the Islamic State on kuffar in conquered territories of the jizya, or infidels tax, and conversion to Islam, or death. It is this disconnect between the West and the Islamic world from which unrest has existed for 1, 400 years. It is this disconnect that today in Germany, despite welcoming almost two million Muslim immigrants, has given rise to a disproportionate increase in social problems and crimes. It has embedded into the Muslim mindset the belief that wherever Muslims go, it must be Islams way or the highway     even when they are guests in a country of  . It is why many Muslim preachers and political leaders warn followers not to integrate as immigrants residing in such countries, but to maintain their Islamic purity by  . This lack of commonality in the value of human life has been addressed twice in the United Nations. When the organization endeavored in 1948 to pass a declaration that all human life was equal in a document known as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) Saudi Arabia abstained. Later, a block of Muslim nations, acting as a group under the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and motivated by Irans mullahs to do so     approved the Cairo Declaration, asserting inaccurately the Cairo Declaration did not replace the UDHR but was complementary to it. However, the Cairo Declaration only recognizes the value of human life as set forth under sharia. Thus, it is a direct repudiation of the UDHR. Any effort to instill trust and understanding between the Muslim and   world will only succeed if there is a mutual appreciation for human equality. There are leaders of the former who recognize this and have suggested Islam is in need of reform. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah   made a plea for this during President Barack Obamas tenure in office, only to have it fall on deaf ears. President Donald Trump, meanwhile, completely understands this, which has led him to reach out to Sisi as well as Jordans King Abdullah II and Muslim leaders sharing a similar mindset, encouraging a Martin Lutheresque reformation of Islam. While President Reagan stirred the emotions of   people everywhere with his challenge to the Soviets to tear down a wall, President Trump needs to issue a similar challenge to the Muslim world. His should be, not to tear down infrastructure, but to build a bridge of understanding between the two worlds based on the same foundation that all human life is of equal value. Lt. Colonel James G.

"Tory Peer Warsi: UK Should Forget About About Integration, Tackle Islamophobia Instead",Breitbart,Virginia Hale,6/12/2017,"There is no point putting Muslims in Britain under scrutiny after three terror attacks in three months, according to Baroness Sayeeda Warsi, who argued the UK should include Islamophobia in its definition of extremism. [Asserting that Britains relationship with its resident Muslims should be reset from scratch, Warsi demanded an end to pressure on the Muslim community, which she declared to be united in fighting terror.  Highlighting how imams and young people have taken to the streets and Muslims have raised money for the victims the former Conservative Party chairman said Muslims in Britain have played their part in opposing Islamist terror attacks and suggested anger at terror attacks is even stronger within the Muslim community than amongst the general public. Ive never seen as much anger. The language used to describe the terrorists has never been sharper, angrier, and, I would say, the level of anger towards the terrorists from British Muslims is even greater than it is within the mainstream, she said. Because of this, the Baroness urged the government to show restraint in its response to terrorism, telling The Guardian: Theres no point saying we need to go deeper into the Muslim community, because in all cases they reported them [the terrorists] it was obvious to them who was radicalised.  According to Warsi, the government should instead be reviewing how it defines extremism, and consider Islamophobia to be a problem similar to that of Islamism. There is still no definition of   extremism, she lamented. The only definition of extremism that exists within government policy is Islamism. We also have no definition of what is Islamophobia.  The Baroness also condemned calls made by policymakers for Muslims to integrate into British society. The majority of terrorists speak good English, she insisted, pointing out that the perpetrators of many of the recent terror attacks lived Westernised lifestyles at some stage. Describing integration as a   pastime Warsi argued the only way the government can tackle the problem of extremist and separatist religious communities in Britain is by improving Muslims situation with regards to economics, poverty, life chances."

London Bridge Terror Ringleader May Have Plotted to Attack Wimbledon,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,6/12/2017,"The ringleader of the London Bridge terror attack secured an interview with a security firm providing personnel to Wimbledon, sparking fears he was plotting to strike the tennis tournament. [Khuram Butt, who was a known extremist on a list of British police extremist suspects, landed the interview with the unnamed firm that also supplies staff to Premier League football matches.  Wimbledon is the oldest and most famous tennis tournament in the world, attracting 493, 928 spectators over 14 days in 2016, and   police are now investigating Mr. Butts motives for trying to work at the iconic event, The Sunday Telegraph reports. The security firm would check his background but it does not have access to the police watch list or have knowledge of any MI5 investigation. There would have been no reason for him not to get the job, a security source told the paper. They added: Butt could not only have caused serious damage but potentially helped other terrorists get into one of these events.  The revelation comes as Scotland Yard released photographs of the three London Bridge attackers fake suicide belts Sunday night. Mr. Butt was a supporter of notorious hate preacher Anjem Choudarys banned terror group   and appeared on a Channel 4 television documentary called The Jihadi Next Door in 2016. He was reported to police for radicalising children in a park and was followed around the clock in 2015 whilst intelligence services were intercepting his communications under a warrant signed by the home secretary. Officers wound down the investigation, however, amidst concerns that there was not enough evidence to convict the suspect and get him off the streets sources told The Sunday Times. The security insider continued: We knew Butt was up to no good. We got to know him intimately. We wanted to get him off the streets. But the view was that we may not have enough to convict.  The   British citizen, who came to the UK as an asylum seeker, was considered by police to be low priority despite warnings from whistleblowers. After he led last weekends attack, which resulted in the death of eight and 48 injured, there are calls for police to   how they handled his case."
Left-Wing Hot Take: James Comeys Like a Victim of Sexual Harassment - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/12/2017,"The left has come up with a takeaway from fired FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee last week: The man who was in charge of the worlds premier security and   forces is a victim of sexual harassment. [Elle compared Comeys    meeting with President Donald Trump to a terrible date:  It goes like this: Comeys new boss invites him out to a work dinner when he arrives, he finds that what he assumed would be a group event has somehow turned into a    meeting. Comey is disturbed that his new boss calls him so often whereas his previous supervisor had initiated just two   conversations with him in two years, the new one insists on having nine    conversations in four months    three in person and six on the phone. Those   conversations, like the work dinner that wasnt, have an air of uncomfortable intimacy before beginning, the boss waits for everyone but Comey to clear the room. Elle concluded that because Comey wouldnt go along with his abuser, he was fired. Dough Porter of the San Diego Free Press said Republicans blame the victim, just as is often the case for rape victims. Women who have ever reported rape   sexual harassment must have been experiencing a strong sense of deja vu with the pattern of Republican attempts to blame   Comey, Porter said. Porter than cited Robin Abcarians column in the Los Angeles Times, which he said, set the scene perfectly.  Is there a working woman alive who cannot identify with poor James Comey right now? The former FBI directors boss tried to seduce him. When the seduction failed, his boss fired him. And then called him crazy, a real nut job, Abcarian wrote. Hell hath no fury like a scorned President Trump, Abcarian wrote. The parallels between Mr. Comeys experiences with President Trump and the facts of a sexual harassment case     I am not the only one to notice them     should perhaps not be that surprising, a Vox writer opined. And rather than focusing on how Comey admitted he helped presidential candidate Hillary Clinton by obeying   General Loretta Lynch order to downplay the investigation into Clintons  mishandling of classified information or how Comey leaked to the press the content of his private conversations with Trump, Vox focused on the workplace issue.  The Vox writer claimed: Sexual harassment is a workplace issue, one in which a supervisor abuses structural power over a subordinate. Americans tuned in, at least in part, to see if Comey would level allegations of improper use of power by his boss, so there was a sense in which the hearings were already set to cover ground familiar to many of us. The Washington Post called Comeys testimony a performance of a lifetime that involved playing two roles at once     the prototypical   and the aggrieved victim of an undisciplined,   president.  In both roles, the play ends with Comey, the deposed FBI director, in a new and uncomfortable place     as the whistleblower, warning the nation about a president who schemes, lies and seeks to corrupt public servants under the guise of loyalty, the Post reported. The Post actually turned to an acting expert to analyze what clearly was the vindication of Trump after months of speculation that he was under investigation for colluding with the Russians during his presidential campaign and practiced obstruction of justice for interfering with the investigation by firing Comey     both confirmed as not true by Comey. Derek Goldman, a theater director and founder of the Laboratory for Global Performance and Politics at Georgetown University, wrote: This was an unusually explicit example of someone in public life walking a tightrope between roles. Comey was trying to get across that Im trustworthy and I acted with integrity, on behalf of the greater good. That requires both his aw, shucks dignity and a capacity to speak truth to power, to blow the whistle. Meanwhile, Newsweek called the Comey hearing Washingtons Super Bowl, based on the crowds that filled D. C. bars at 9:30 a. m. Thursday to drink and watch it unfold on big screen televisions. To many of the women watching, the   seemed uncomfortably familiar, Newsweek reported, citing a liberal Hollywood writer. Nicole Serratore,  a theater and travel writer, tweeted that it read so weirdly like a date with terrible guy. Her   tweet was quickly followed by a more serious string of messages. If you substitute sex for loyalty in all these exchanges its like a guy who does not understand consent  wont stop until he gets his way, she wrote.  So much of Comeys dinner story echoes accounts of FOX sexual harassment. Its hard to miss the weird parallels, including documentation.     emily nussbaum (@emilynussbaum) June 8, 2017,  So Comey told Jeff Sessions he didnt want to be alone with Trump. Women across the country can relate.     Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) June 7, 2017,  On Twitter, several women agreed with Serratore, adding that the committees questioning of Comey sounded like the   of sexual assault survivors, Newsweek reported. In response to Democratic Senator Dianne Feinsteins question: Why didnt you stop and say, Mr. President, this is wrong. I cannot discuss this with you? Nell Scovell, a liberal TV writer and director, tweeted about the Comeys testimony, describing date rape.    rapeI remain puzzled by your response. When he said Flynns a good guy, why didnt you say X? Why did you stay in his room?     Nell Scovell (@NellSco) June 8, 2017,"
L.A. #ResistMarch: The Day the Gay Rights Movement Ended - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/12/2017,"The conversion of the Los Angeles Gay Pride march into the   #ResistMarch on Sunday marked the effective end of the gay rights movement. [Once, the gay rights movement stood for tolerance: hence the rainbow flag, which is a symbol not only of pride but also of acceptance. But the message on Sunday was that lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer (LGBTQ) conservatives are unwelcome in that spectrum     and are, in fact, aiding the enemy.  The purpose of Gay Pride parades, in L. A. and elsewhere, has historically been to create an environment into which LGBTQ individuals could come out of the closet and express their sexuality without fear of persecution. But the complete transformation of the gay rights movement into a   political monolith has created an environment profoundly hostile to gay conservatives. The gay rights movement has destroyed one closet, only to build another. Aside from the totalitarian,   mentality of some of the movements leaders     which was on full display in the screeching speeches from the front of the march on Sunday     there are two other reasons for the gay rights movements transformation from a force for liberation into a tool for repression. One is that the movement has run out of great causes for which to fight. With the Supreme Courts June 2015 discovery of a right to gay marriage in the U. S. Constitution, the gay rights movement has little left to achieve. It has poured energy and resources into the new cause of transgender rights, but that is a deeply complicated issue that affects a tiny percentage of Americans. The other reason the gay rights movement appears to have adopted a   political approach is that its leaders seem to think that they simply do not need Republican support. Although Americans, and Republicans in particular, have been increasingly tolerant toward the LGBTQ community     with Donald Trump specifically   the movement at the 2016 Republican National Convention     the gay rights movement has generally preferred to fight its cause in the courts rather than appealing to the goodwill of voters. That strategy has largely worked, and the lesson the movement and its leaders appear to have drawn is that they can dispense with Republicans as allies. But it is one thing to ignore Republicans, and quite another to declare war on them. The leaders of L. A. Pride made a conscious decision to turn their annual celebration into a Democratic Party rally, adopting the rhetoric of the   Resistance.  There was not even a perfunctory gesture at bipartisanship. The battle lines were sharply drawn, with even our love, and our music, and our joy denied to people who might vote for the opposing political party. The #ResistMarch willingly cast aside the idea of standing up for LGBTQ people of all political backgrounds. In so doing, it effectively declared the gay rights movement over. Gay Pride is no longer about pride: it is about the mobilization of popular culture for partisan purposes, with LGBTQ conservatives shoved behind the closet door. Joel B.

"If a nuclear bomb goes off, this is the most important thing you can do to survive",Business Insider,Dave Mosher,6/12/2017,"The Cold War may have ended in 1991, but the looming threat of   nuclear attack lives on with more than  wielded by nine nations.     A   nuclear detonation is one of  that the federal government  with state and city governments     just in case.     National planning scenario   is a   nuclear   detonation in a modern US city,    a health physicist and radiation expert at Lawrence Livermore   National Laboratory (LLNL) told Business Insider. A     nuclear detonation is equivalent to 5, 000 Oklahoma City bombings.   Though we call it  its a pretty darn big explosion.        Buddemeier could not estimate the likelihood of such a terrorist   attack, stating its one of these things that changes with   time.     However, its not an unfounded concern with the proliferation of   fissile nuclear material and  in stockpiles.     If a nuclear detonation were to occur, and you somehow avoided   the   flash, crushing blast wave, and incendiary   fireball, Buddemeier says there is one simple thing that could   increase your odds of survival.     Shelter, shelter, shelter, he says. The same place you would   go to protect yourself from a tornado is a great place to go.     What youd be hiding from is sandy, deadly, and arrives just   minutes.     A fearsome   of nuclear blasts is called fallout,   which is a complex mixture of fission products (or radioisotopes)   created by splitting atoms.     Many of these fission products decay rapidly and emit gamma   radiation     an invisible yet highly energetic form of light.   Exposure to too much of this radiation in a short time can damage   the bodys cells and its ability to fix itself, which is a   condition called .     It also affects the immune system and your ability to fight   infections, Buddemeier says.     Only very dense and thick materials, like many feet of dirt or   inches of lead, can reliably stop the gamma radiation emitted by   fallout.        The fireball from a   explosion is so hot, it actually   shoots up into the atmosphere at over 100 miles per hour,   Buddemeier says. These fission products mix in with the dirt and   debris thats drawn up into the atmosphere from the fireball. . ..   What were talking about is 8, 000 tons of dirt and debris being   drawn up into this cloud.     The   fallout can loft more than five miles into the   air. Larger chunks and pieces quickly rain back down, but the   lighter particles can be sprinkled over distant areas.     Close into the [blast] site, they may be a bit larger than      but really what were talking about are things   like   or   particles, Buddemeier says, adding that   fallout doesnt really resemble snow or dust, as movies often   depict. Its the penetrating gamma radiation coming off of those   particles thats the hazard.     A  for a variety of   reasons, says Buddemeier. For one, your ability to know where   the fallouts gonna go, and outrun it, are     well, its very   unlikely, he says. Fallout is carried by   winds   that are often booking along at 100 miles per hour, he adds, so   youd be very unlikely to   or   the fallout.       Plus, streets would probably be full of erratic drivers,   accidents, and debris. Some vehicles may also not work due    or EMP.     But most importantly, you shouldnt assume that the glass and   metal of a vehicle can protect you from fallout, says   Buddemeier. Modern vehicles are made of glass and very light   metals, and they offer almost no protection. Youre just going to   sit on a road someplace and be exposed.     A much better shelter is likely within a quick walk or run of   wherever you may be, Buddemeier says, and the .     Your best shot at survival after a nuclear disaster is to   immediately get into a robust structure and stay there.   Buddemeier is a fan of the mantra go in, stay in, tune in.     Get inside . .. and get to the center of that building. If you   happen to have access to   areas, getting below ground   is great, he says.     Besides cars, the poorest shelters are made of wood, plaster, and   other materials that dont shield much radiation (about 20% of   houses fall into this category). Better shelters, such as schools   and offices, are made of bricks or concrete and have few or no   windows.     Soil is a great shield from radiation, says Buddemeier, so   ducking into a home with a half basement is better than going   into a place with no basement at all.        Next, stay in 12 to 24 hours, he says.     The reason to wait is that levels of gamma and other radiation   fall off exponentially after a nuclear blast as hot   radioisotopes decay into more stable atoms. This slowly shrinks   the dangerous fallout zone     the area where   winds   have dropped the most radioactive fission products.        A recent study by Michael B. Dillon, a colleague of Buddemeiers   at LLNL, suggests that moving to a stronger shelter or basement    if you initially ducked into a flimsy   one. But whatever structure youre moving to should be less than   five minutes away. (Though if youre very close to the blast   site, stay put in whatever you can find.)     Finally, tune in.     Try to use whatever communication tools you have, Buddemeier   says, adding that a   radio is a good object to keep   at work and home, since emergency providers would be broadcasting   instructions, tracking the fallout cloud, and identifying where   any safe corridors for escape could be.     Despite the fearsome power of a nuclear EMP, which has the   potential to damage electronics, Buddemeier says there is a good   chance that there will be plenty of functioning radios even   within a few miles of the event that can provide information on   the safest strategy to keep you and your family safe.     Buddemeier says he hopes no one will ever have to act on his   advice. But if people can find good shelters, he says the blow of   an unthinkable catastrophe could be softened.     We may not be able to do much about the blast casualties,   because where you were were is where you were, and you cant   really change that. But fallout casualties are entirely   preventable, he says. In a large city . .. knowing what to do   after an event like this can literally save hundreds of thousands   of people from radiation illness or fatalities.  A small nuclear bomb set off by a terrorist is. .."
97% of Voters in Bankrupt Puerto Rico Want Statehood - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/12/2017,"The banner headline will read 97 percent of Puerto Rico voted for statehood, but only 23 percent of voters cast ballots on June 11 due to opposition boycotting. [Of the 2, 458, 036 registered voters in Puerto Rico, about 548, 387, or 97 percent, of Puerto Ricans voted in a   referendum for the territory to become Americas 51st state, while approximately 16, 960, or 3 percent, were opposed, according to the Wall Street Journal review of early returns. Turnout was just 23 percent.  Governor Ricardo Rossell and his   New Progressive Party [Republican] held the referendum, despite filing on May 3 for the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States. The island and its   utility ran out of cash and defaulted on its $73 billion of debt. After the filing, Breitbart News reported that Puerto Ricos public pension plans have only $1. 8 billion in assets to pay $45 billion in liabilities. The New Progressive Party, referred to as PNP in Spanish, pushed the yes vote for statehood. President Barack Obama provided the $2. 5 million in funding to hold the referendum. But with the PNP narrowly winning the governorship in 2016, the Republican Partys GOTV (   ) operation funded social media and TV ads in favor of statehood. Jennifer   Puerto Ricos Resident Commissioner and only nonvoting member of Congress, is a strong advocate of statehood as a leader of the PNP. Just after taking office in January, she introduced statehood legislation into Congress, but found little interest in the idea that Puerto Rico would pick up two U. S. Senators. Congressional Democrats with Puerto Rican heritage, including Luis Gutirrez ( ) and Nydia Velzquez (  oppose statehood and urged the islanders to boycott the referendum, according to the Associated Press. Puerto Rico currently suffers from a poverty rate of 45 percent and 12. 4 percent unemployment. The Republicans blame the islands   depression on the confusing status of being a territory. But Democrats enjoy spending the $22 billion in federal subsidies that the territory receives. Puerto Rico faces a huge battle against vulture capitalist hedge funds that have bought its defaulted bonds for as little as 25 percent of face value. The vultures claim that Puerto Rico can regain its solvency by raising taxes and firing tens of thousands public sector workers. Bloomberg reported on Election Day that Puerto Rico and the vultures will soon face off next week in a New York federal bankruptcy court over who owns cash collected by the governments sales tax agency, known by its Spanish acronym Cofina.  The island claims that despite not making any bond payments, it needs the cash to avoid beginning to miss payroll and disability payments by around November 1. Investors claim their bonds should be paid first."
"Ninth Circuit Denounces Donald Trumps Refugee Orders, Says Not Justified - Breitbart",Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/12/2017,"The   U. S. Court of Appeals for the 9th Circuit said Monday that President Donald Trumps March 9 executive immigration order on refugees is unconstitutionally vague. [The   decision declared that President Trump must justify his policies in court by citing agency recommendations and that he cannot unilaterally curb the annual inflow of refugees from 100, 000 to 50, 000 even though prior presidents have raised and lowered the annual inflow of refugees without interference from the judges.  Immigration, even for the President, is not a   show, the judges declared in their   decision, tiled  continuing: The Presidents authority is subject to certain statutory and constitutional restraints. We conclude that the President, in issuing the Executive Order, exceeded the scope of the authority delegated to him by Congress. In suspending the entry of more than 180 million nationals from six countries, suspending the entry of all refugees, and reducing the cap on the admission of refugees from 110, 000 to 50, 000 for the 2017 fiscal year, the President did not meet the essential precondition to exercising his delegated authority: The President must make a sufficient finding that the entry of these classes of people would be detrimental to the interests of the United States.  Further, the Order runs afoul of other provisions of the INA that prohibit   discrimination and require the President to follow a specific process when setting the annual cap on the admission of refugees. Throughout their decision, the three judges     all of whom were appointed by former President Bill Clinton    insisted that the President needs to justify his immigration decisions, including the March 2017 Executive Order, dubbed EO2 by detailing the reasons why migrants or refugees should be excluded despite the impossibility of predicting future behavior based on incomplete records and flexible, hidden personal views.  The lawsuit is titled State of Hawaii: Ismail elShikh vs Donald J. Trump. The case was brought by an Egyptian immigrant cleric based in Hawaii, who claimed Trumps policy could block his old    from moving to Hawaii. The claim was supported by the ACLU, Islamist groups, and many elite lawyers.  The decision by the California judges will either be approved or rejected by the Supreme Court, as soon as the fall. Much of the executive order was already blocked by another group of progressive judges in Virginia, who claimed that it is unconstitutional because of Trumps   criticism of Islam. The California court did not bring up Trumps campaign comments or claim religious animus, but repeatedly emphasized that Trump needs support from agency reports and the courts before he can rewrite the nations immigration policies. To justify its claim for a greater bureaucratic and judicial role in national immigration policy, the court had to deal with a 1952 law giving the president   authority over immigration policy. According to the court: In the INA of 1952, Congress delegated some of its power to the President through Section 212( f) which provides: Whenever the President finds that the entry of any aliens or of any class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, he may by proclamation, and for such period as he shall deem necessary, suspend the entry of all aliens or any class of aliens as immigrants or nonimmigrants, or impose on the entry of aliens any restrictions he may deem to be appropriate. In response, the court argues that: Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States, adding: Section 1182( f) [of the law] requires that the President find that the entry of a class of aliens into the United States would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. This section requres that the Presidents findings support the conclusion that entry of all nationals from the six designated countries, all refugees, and refugees in excess of 50, 000 would be harmful to the national interest. There is no sufficient finding in EO2 that the entry of the excluded classes would be detrimental to the interests of the United States. Also, the president has not produced documents from the bureaucracies to back up his decisions, says the court: There is no finding that present vetting standards are inadequate, and no finding that absent the improved vetting procedures there likely will be harm to our national interests. These identified reasons do not support the conclusion that the entry of nationals from the six designated countries would be harmful to our national interests. The president has not explained in detail why groups of refugees or individual migrants from the six target nations should be excluded, the court declares. The Order does not tie these nationals in any way to terrorist organizations within the six designated countries. It does not identify these nationals as contributors to active conflict or as those responsible for insecure country conditions. It does not provide any link between an individuals nationality and their propensity to commit terrorism or their inherent dangerousness. In short, the Order does not provide a rationale explaining why permitting entry of nationals from the six designated countries under current protocols would be detrimental to the interests of the United States        In conclusion, the Order does not offer a sufficient justification to suspend the entry of more than 180 million people on the basis of nationality. National security is not a talismanic incantation that, once invoked, can support any and all exercise of executive power under  1182( f). The court also relied on President Barack Obamas judgment that upping the inflow of refugees to 110, 000 a year is safe, saying: President Obama previously determined that the admission of 110, 000 refugees to the United States during fiscal year 2017 was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest       To the extent that 60, 000 additional refugees can be considered a class of aliens, EO2 makes no findings to justify barring entry in excess of 50, 000 as detrimental to the interests of the United States. EO2 gives no explanation for why the 50, 001st to the 110, 000th refugee would be harmful to the national interest, nor does it specify any further threat to national security. And there is not any rationale explaining why the previous target admission of 110, 000 refugees this fiscal year was justified by humanitarian concerns or otherwise in the national interest, see 8 U. S. C.  1157( a)(2) but that the entry of more than 50, 000 refugees this same fiscal year would be detrimental to the national interest. Here too, the President did not meet the statutory precondition of exercising his authority under  1182( f) to cap refugee admissions. The decision is found here."
U.S. Envoy To UN Haley Witness To Spat Between IDF and UN Officials,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,6/12/2017,"TEL AVIV     U. S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley was witness to a heated dispute between UN and IDF officials while she toured Israels northern border, Channel 2 reported Sunday. [Haley was briefed by UNIFIL commander Maj. Gen. Michael Berry who told her the situation on the border with Hezbollah was relatively calm and did not require immediate intervention. Maj. Gen. Aviv Kochavi, Deputy IDF Chief of Staff and the former head of the Northern Command, reportedly interrupted Berry, telling Haley the situation was the exact opposite. He added that UNIFIL was failing at its job and was too afraid of penetrating the villages and cities of southern Lebanon for fear of encountering the Hezbollah terror group.  The argument happened after Haley asked Berry, according to the report, whether a change was necessary to better handle the situation on the border facing the strengthening of Hezbollah.  Berry was quoted answering that the region is calm, the situation is good and there is no need for a change.  Kochavi stepped in and reportedly said, Im sorry my friend, we think entirely differently, UNIFIL dont enter villages and cities [and are therefore not as aware of the situation as the IDF is].  Kochavi had called on Haley to help bring about a change in the mandate of the UN interim force, allowing it to disarm Hezbollah. According to the report, an Israeli diplomat later apologized to Haley for the argument, but she said she was not disturbed by it. In fact, she added, seeing the reality of the Israeli side was a good thing that would influence her work at the UN. Last week, Breitbart Jerusalem reported that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Haley had discussed ways to make the   UNIFIL mandate more effective in enforcing Security Council Resolution 1701 passed at the end of the 2006 Second Lebanon War. According to the terms of that resolution, the territory from the   border to the Litani River is to be an area free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Government of Lebanon.  According to Israeli estimates, Hezbollah now has about 150, 000 missiles."
"WATCH: Abbas Senior Adviser: We Wont Give Inch Of Western Wall, It Must Be In Muslim Control",Breitbart,Deborah Danan,6/12/2017,"TEL AVIV     The Western Wall should always remain under Muslim control and we will not give a single millimeter to the Israelis, the Palestinian Authoritys supreme Sharia judge and senior adviser to PA President Mahmoud Abbas said on Friday, contradicting earlier remarks made by a PA official who acknowledged that the Wall is one of Judaisms holiest sites and as such should remain in Jewish hands. [The   wall is an integral part of the Islamic faith and religion, and is associated with the Prophet Muhammad, Mahmoud   said in a sermon broadcast on official Palestinian Authority TV, using the Islamic name for the Western Wall.  It is an Islamic Waqf (endowment) that can never be for  . It cannot be under the sovereignty of  .        The   wall belongs to us and cannot be conceded, he added. We cannot possibly relinquish a single millimeter, a single stone, a single micromillimeter of the   Wall and of the blessed   Mosque.  The Western Wall is the last remaining outer wall of the Temple Mount complex and is the holiest place for Jews to pray. Muslims believe the Prophet Muhammad tied   his winged horse, to the wall when he made his journey from Mecca to Jerusalem. Habashs remarks came days after senior Fatah official Jibril Rajoub said on Israeli TV that the wall is a Jewish holy site and as such must remain under Jewish sovereignty. We understand [the wall is] a holy place to the Jews. In the end, it must remain under Jewish sovereignty. We have no argument about that. This is a Jewish holy place, Rajoub told Channel 2 TV in Hebrew. Rajoub, who is also head of the Palestinian Football Association, was praising U. S. President Donald Trumps efforts to reach a peace deal between Israel and the Palestinians and commenting on Trumps visit last month to Israel and the West Bank. Rajoub, who has in the past stated that he is proud he served time in an Israeli jail for lobbing a grenade at a bus full of IDF soldiers in 1970, later tried to deny he ever made such a statement. In a Facebook post, he declared that his remarks were mistranslated, and that he had not referred to Israeli sovereignty. Last month, Trump became the first sitting U. S. president to visit the Western Wall, but did so as a private visit. Last week, U. S. envoy to the UN Nikki Haley visited the wall in what was also billed as a private visit.

IDF Official: Ramallah Theaters Boycott of Wonder Woman Shows Weakness and Fear,Breitbart,Deborah Danan,6/12/2017,"TEL AVIV     The decision by a movie theater in the Palestinian Authority not to screen the blockbuster movie Wonder Woman because it stars Israeli actress Gal Gadot suggests weakness and fear, a senior IDF official said on Sunday. [Apparently, at the Berg Palestine Theater in Ramallah they are afraid the audience will enjoy the excellent movie Wonder Woman, and cannot separate politics from an American film, Maj. Gen. Yoav Mordechai, the head of the IDFs Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories (COGAT) unit, wrote in Arabic on his Facebook page.  Those who are sure of themselves are not afraid of movies, even if they star Wonder Woman! Mordechai concluded. The movie, which has already grossed nearly $300 million, was banned in Lebanon and and faced boycotts at movie theaters and festivals in Jordan, Tunisia and Algeria. Gadot, who served in the IDF during the 2006 Lebanon war, has come under fire for her open support of Israel, in particular for a tweet during 2014s conflict with Gaza in which she prayed for the safety of Israels citizens."

Dozens arrested as South Korean military conducts gay witch-hunt,CNN,Paula Hancocks,6/12/2017,"Seoul (CNN)Sergeant A doesnt want to give his real name, his exact rank or show his face.  Speaking to CNN, he said he was afraid the South Korean military would find out he was talking to the media. He faces charges for having sexual relations with another man, a crime within the South Korean military punishable by up to two years in prison.  Sergeant A is part of a wider investigation which human rights groups are calling a homophobic   an accusation the military rejects.  Homosexuality is not illegal for civilians in South Korea but human rights groups say the rights of sexual minorities are not always protected.  Witch hunt  Investigators visited Sergeant A in March    telling him they knew he was gay and his   had already admitted their crimes.  They asked him deeply personal and explicit questions, leaving him feeling uncomfortable and humiliated, Sergeant A told CNN.  The atmosphere was very oppressive and humiliating, he said. I was scared.  The South Korea military and the defense ministry declined multiple requests for an interview and referred CNN to an April statement: To keep the military community sound and given the special nature of military discipline, sexual relations with same sex soldiers are being punished as disgraceful conduct under military law.  The military penal code bans homosexual activity under Article   to keep the military community sound.  The law regards   relations between soldiers as disgraceful conduct, akin to sexual assault. One man convicted last month was given a six month suspended prison sentence.  In a statement, Amnesty International East Asia director Roseann Rife called for the conviction to be immediately overturned and the group condemned what it described as an outrageous military gay  .  Gay panic, The recent investigation started earlier this year after a video was posted on social media showing two male soldiers having sex.  Since then, according to human rights groups and local media, at least 32 soldiers have been charged. The military declined to give a number.  Lim   an activist with the Military Human Rights Center for Korea (MHRCK) said the military has been using gay dating apps to try and track down homosexual soldiers.  Sergeant A told CNN his phone was taken and its contents copied, he claimed investigators insinuated his unit would find out about his sexuality if he refused.  They knew that I would not want my identity revealed so they made me cooperate in the investigation, he said.  Amnesty has called on Seoul to repeal this archaic and discriminatory provision in the military criminal code, criticizing the government for being slow to protect the rights of sexual minorities within the country.  During the recent election campaign, now President Moon   drew intense criticism from LGBT groups after he said he was opposed to homosexuality in a televised debate.  Days later he walked that back slightly, saying that it was still a little early to allow homosexuality within the military on the ground that South Korean society was not ready for it. He has not broached the subject since being sworn in."
Swamp Fights Back: Mueller Hires Clinton Foundation Lawyer for Russia Probe - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/12/2017,"Reputed Trump confidant and Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy told PBS Newss Judy Woodruff Monday that President Donald Trump is considering dismissing Special Counsel Robert Mueller, according to a tweet by Woodruff. [.@ChrisRuddyNMX tells me Pres Trump is considering perhaps terminating Robert Mueller as special counsel @NewsHour,     Judy Woodruff (@JudyWoodruff) June 12, 2017,   The news comes on the eve of Attorney General Jeff Sessions testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committe on the Russia investigation. This follows a hearing featuring the testimony of fired FBI director James Comey before the same body. Mueller     who, on his appointment by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, took independent control of the investigation into Russian involvement in the 2016 elections     had a shadow cast on his impartiality when Comey, a   mentee of Muellers who suceeded him at the Bureau, revealed under oath that he deliberately leaked a potentially privileged memo to the press specifically to ensure the appointment of a special counsel. The ploy worked. Rosenstein, who was handling the investigation because Sessions had already recused himself based on his involvement in the 2016 Trump presidential campaign, came under immense political pressure to appoint a special counsel. Mueller was quickly applauded as an impartial choice by voices across the political spectrum. Since his appointment, he has made signals as to the criminal nature of his investigation, hiring Andrew Weissmann, the former head of the DOJ criminal divisions fraud section, and former Deputy Solicitor General Michael Dreeben. A more controversial pick of Muellers was former prosecutor and WilmerHale partner Jeannie Rhee. In 2015, according to Politico, she performed work for the Clinton Foundation, defending it from FOIA requests related to Hillary Clintons private email server. These developements have raised some red flags on the right. For example, Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told Fox News, This is going to be a witch hunt.  Joining the chorus was Americans for Limited Government President Rick Manning, suggesting Muellers role should be curtailed if not eliminated. In a prepared statement, he wrote: Given former FBI Director James Comeys testimony that there is no collusion between President Trump and Russia to do with the campaign, the scope of Special Counsel Robert Muellers investigation should be dramatically narrowed by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to simply the leaks and the Obama administration unmaskings to led to this witch hunt in the first place. If Mueller refuses to investigate these leaks, which are one of the central reasons he was even appointed as Special Counsel, then the Special Counsel should be discontinued. It is not up to the Justice Department to choose who the President of the United States is. The American people already made that decision in 2016. Sessions will testify tomorrow at 2:30 p. m. Eastern Time."
Trump Apprenticeship Plan Aimed at Filling Six Million Job Vacancies - Breitbart,Breitbart,Kristina Wong,6/12/2017,"President Trump is due to announce an apprenticeship initiative on Wednesday that will aim to fill a gap between six million jobs currently available and American workers who can fill them, Labor Secretary Alex Acosta said Monday. [Acosta said despite there being six million job openings in the U. S. there are not enough Americans workers with specialized skills to fill them.  Americans want to work. American companies want to hire, he said at a White House briefing. The issue is a mismatch between available jobs and prospective employee jobs skills.  He highlighted that the current unemployment rate is 4. 3 percent     the lowest it has been in 16 years, since 2001. But, he said, there are currently about 6. 9 million American workers unemployed. Acosta said the new initiative will aim to foster   partnerships between employers and educational institutions such as community colleges so that American workers can gain the skills they need without accumulating massive debt. Those fields will include the   sectors of health care and information technology, as well as the legal field and law enforcement, he said. He said they will also include manufacturing and construction. Acosta said there are currently 360, 000 job vacancies in manufacturing and 200, 000 jobs in construction. Apprenticeships will enable workers to gear their education towards getting jobs and not acquiring huge amounts of debt, Acosta said. For example, he said he spoke to a student at a university who wanted to become a police officer and was studying criminal justice. When [he] graduated, he had student debt, but he didnt have a job because criminal justice doesnt prepare you to be a police officer, he said. So what would things be like if actually a criminal justice degree allowed students that wanted to have the option to also attend a police academy? He said another example would be an education program to receive job training to be a paralegal or legal assistant. Acosta said apprenticeships can also reach certain communities, such as women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math, or STEM. This is going to be a great thing for expanding opportunities, for example, to women and STEM, he said. But, he added, Were looking to push apprenticeships across the board     all people, all industries. This is an opportunity for everyone.  White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who briefed White House reporters after Acosta, said the Department of Agriculture on Monday released guidance for American beef producers preparing to ship beef to Chinese markets for the first time since 2003. Last month, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping reached an agreement to reopen the Chinese market to American beef exports, which Spicer said is a $2. 5 billion market. The presidents goal is a booming and vibrant American economy. The administration will continue to work everyday to turn the presidents promises into policies, he said."
Schweizer: Sessions Ending DOJ Handouts to Activist Groups a Tremendous Victory,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,6/12/2017,"President of the Government Accountability Institute, Peter Schweizer, spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXX host Raheem Kassam on Monday regarding Attorney General Jeff Sessions decision to end Department of Justice handouts for leftist groups, which has come to be known as something of a slush fund. [As Breitbart News reported:  For decades, through a variety of initiatives, the DOJ has insisted on donations to third parties as part of the settlements it reaches with defendants, especially corporations. In the Obama administration, this practice took on the character of a slush fund, which funneled hundreds of millions of dollars from these corporate defendants and put it into the hands of   organizations. Recipients have included   community organizer groups such as the National Council of La Raza, or The Race, a Latino racial advocacy group that supports mass illegal immigration. Other recipients include the National Urban League, the National Community Reinvestment Coalition, and NeighborWorks America, which is a congressionally chartered mortgage aid group that itself has come under widespread criticism. This is a tremendous victory people ought to be very encouraged by, said Schweizer. The idea got its start under Eric Holder as far back as the Clinton administration. The problem is, it got distorted, as so many things do in Washington, DC, added Schweizer. And so rather than going to the victims of what a company might have done, they ended up giving it to activist groups. And many of these activist groups, like La Raza, like others, not only didnt do things to alleviate the activity that had taken place, they actually used the money for things like voter registration.  These were politically active groups, he added. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern. LISTEN:"
Cartel-linked Border Politician Loses Congressional Bid in Mexico,Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz,6/12/2017,"PIEDRAS NEGRAS, Coahuila     A former governor singled out in U. S. and Spanish courts as a surrogate of Los Zetas cartel lost his bid for Mexicos Congress and a chance at receiving prosecutorial immunity. [This week, the Mexican border state of Coahuila was on edge as the region underwent an electoral process plagued with allegations of voter fraud at the highest level. As Breitbart Texas reported, thousands of citizens peacefully protested the alleged theft of the election by members of Mexicos Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI).  For more than 70 years, the PRI has maintained some sort of power throughout Mexico in elections plagued with accusations of voter fraud. As Breitbart Texas reported, the political party has a long history of ties with Mexican drug cartels. Various governors from the PRI were exposed in U. S. court testimony and documents for working with the same drug cartels responsible for violence around the nation. One of those former governors, Humberto Moreira, was blamed for giving protection to Los Zetas in exchange for bribes. After Moreiras term, his brother Ruben assumed power and is about to conclude his term. Election watchdogs expected the oppositino party to succeed following the Moreiras, but were stunned by upset victories thereafter. In that election, Moreira was kicked out of the PRI and ran with the Partido Joven in an attempt to win a plurinominal congressional seat. Mexicos law provides prosecutorial immunity to federal elected officials. That attempt at protection failed this week when the final tally of the votes revealed that his party missed the threshold needed for him to get a congressional seat by only a handful of votes. According to Coahuila state law, Partido Joven needed to achieve three percent of the total votes in order to remain an active party, and for Moreira to win a congressional seat. The party only received 35, 113 votes or 2. 87 percent of the total. Ildefonso Ortiz is an   journalist with Breitbart Texas. He   the Cartel Chronicles project with Brandon Darby and Stephen K.

EXCLUSIVE  Carter Page Requests Release of FISA Warrant Details Concocted by James Comeys FBI - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/12/2017,"PHILADELPHIA     Carter Page, the American financial consultant who was tangentially and briefly associated with Donald Trumps presidential campaign, on Monday sent a request to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein seeking the release of information used to reportedly obtain a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA) warrant to monitor his personal communications. [Page sent the inquiry in an email to Rosenstein shared exclusively with Breitbart News.  The FISA information release request was sent ahead of Tuesdays scheduled Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Page wrote: Whereas this will be an open hearing (with Sessions) I would kindly request the immediate prior release of my illegitimate 2016 FISA warrants which were allegedly concocted by the FBI on Mr. Comeys watch.       I know that your team at the DoJ is currently working on my related request for these documents.  However, the highly   nature of tomorrows SSCI hearing would offer essential context for these discussions before Congress.       I think the really important documents you could release would show a great deal about the nature of not just Comey and his continued lies, but the exceptionally dishonest nature of the Clinton campaign and Obama Administration on whose behalf he was acting.  Thank you in advance for your consideration. On April 11, the Washington Post cited law enforcement and other U. S. officials stating that, as part of its investigation into alleged Russian collusion, the FBI obtained a secret FISA court order last summer to monitor Pages communications. The Post acknowledged it was reporting on leaked information, highlighting that the officials spoke about the court order on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss details of a counterintelligence probe.  The Post further reported on the court order: The FBI and the Justice Department obtained the warrant targeting Carter Pages communications after convincing a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court judge that there was probable cause to believe Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power, in this case Russia, according to the officials. The newspaper allowed that Page had not been accused of any crimes. It reported that the FISA court renewed the   warrant on Page more than once, according to the officials. The U. S. government has not responded to a Freedom of Information Act request from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) seeking information on why Page was surveilled. In April, CNN reported that the controversial   dossier on Trump compiled by a former British intelligence officer served as part of the FBIs justification for seeking the FISA courts approval to clandestinely monitor Page. In his testimony last month before the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on FBI oversight,   Director James B. Comey repeatedly refused to answer questions about his agencys ties to the dossier, including whether it was used in the Russia probe. In subsequent testimony last week, Comey admitted that he pushed back against a request from Trump to possibly investigate the origins of salacious material that the agency possessed in the course of its investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential campaign. The salacious material is clearly a reference to claims made inside the controversial dossier. The partially discredited dossier contains wild and unproven claims that the Russians had information on Trump and sordid sexual acts, including the mocked claim that Trump hired prostitutes and had them urinate on a hotel room bed. The document was authored by former intelligence agent Christopher Steele, who was reportedly paid by Democrats and   Republicans to investigate Trump. In April, Steele conceded in court documents that part of his work still needed to be verified. The Steele document, which Page refers to as the Dodgy Dossier, makes the unsubstantiated claim that Page met with Russian officials as an envoy for the Trump campaign to discuss policy issues and topics related to alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Page has steadfastly denied meeting any of the officials mentioned in Steeles dossier and he says he never served as an envoy for the Trump campaign. Page and campaign, Pages role in Trumps presidential campaign has long been seemingly exaggerated in the news media. In an interview with the Posts editorial board last March, Trump briefly mentioned Page as a member of his foreign policy advisory team. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks clarified that Pages role was informal.  Page has been cited in various news media reports as an   policy adviser to Trumps campaign and a Trump associate.  An article in the New Yorker recently claimed he was a member of Trumps inner circle.  In the letter to the House Intelligence Committee last month, Page states that he never met Trump and that he was an informal, unpaid campaign volunteer and a very junior member of the Trump movement who didnt actually have any direct    discussions or meetings with our candidate.  Page charges that the news media has been inflating his relationship with Trumps presidential campaign in an effort to tarnish the U. S. president.

"Pamela Geller: Sharia Law Is Misogynistic, Anti-Semitic, Anti-Infidel, Anti-Gay, Anti-Free Speech",Breitbart,John Hayward,6/12/2017,"On Mondays Breitbart News Daily, Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, discussed the weekends   law marches with SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam. [Its great to see Americans are waking up, Geller said. Sharia is the most brutal and extreme system of governance ideology on the face of the Earth. It is misogynistic. It is  . It is  . It is  . It is   speech.   She said amputations, stonings, and sex slavery could be found in Muslim countries living under sharia law. It is, as Sam Harris said, the motherlode of bad ideas, she said. And, of course, its been slow in educating the American people because you have this enormous machine, this   machine that controls much of the information battlespace     if its media or culture, movies, entertainment, and even in the coverage of these marches, it was enormously and wildly slanted, which, of course, were used to.  But the American people are waking up. Clearly, theyre waking up in Europe as well, although, of course, I was disappointed, unquestionably, in the U. K. elections because I just think Labor and Corbyn are so to the left of bad, said Geller. Again, its a fight, she stressed. War is in the information battlespace. Its sort of David vs. Goliath, but we know how that wound up. Theres hope.  Kassam pointed out that the U. K. government was quick to block people like Geller, Robert Spencer, and Michael Savage from entering the country because their speech was classified as unacceptably divisive, while 23, 000 jihadis were greeted with, Sure. Whatever. Dont worry about it.  Oh, I completely agree. The fact is, youre not going to have me advocate for May. She did ban me and said Muslims might get violent if I was to appear, Geller said, referring to actions British Prime Minister Theresa May took as home secretary. Well, you know, how did that work out for you, PM May? But Corbyn is, you know, its an abomination, she added, as Kassam interjected to highlight Corbyns past support for Hamas, Hezbollah, and the IRA. Its really shocking that these were your two choices. France was an enormous disappointment as well.  She zinged Muslim activist Linda Sarsour, whom she described as the icon of the left for running down the marches and praising sharia the whole day, the whole of the weekend.  This is who the left holds up as their leader? This is who feminists hold up as leader of the Womens March? she asked. Geller and Kassam ribbed Sarsour for affecting speech patterns that make it sound as if she is an authentic voice of the Arab world or Palestinian territories, when, in fact, she was born in Brooklyn. Thats her schtick, said Geller. But she is the product of an arranged marriage. She never speaks against it. She advocates for this sharia. She supports it. Many of the things she said about really brave women     you know, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is truly a singular, brave woman. For her to run her down that way, this to me shows that the left is off the rails.   Of course, there are going to be women like Linda Sarsour. There are going to be women that hold down their children to be cut in female genital mutilation. But for her to be held up and asked to keynote the CUNY commencement address and speak at Dartmouth while my colleagues and I are blacklisted! she exclaimed.  This is really the blacklist, not McCarthyism, because everybody worked. They still worked. They changed their names a little bit, they tweaked it, but they still worked. This is the real blacklist, and the objective is so that the message does not get out. And its worked, which is why we see people waking up across the world, not just America. Very encouraging, Geller said. Kassam wondered if the left was in danger of disappearing up its own backside by holding up people like Linda Sarsour and Jeremy Corbyn as leaders. They want war, Geller said. Theres no question about it. Listen, we held a massive protest against Linda Sarsour, and then you have their puppets, so to speak, in politics like Mayor de Blasio for example, who, generally, when theres a   its always     listen, Ive been doing this 15 years     its always across the street or its catercorner. He put them not three feet away from us, and they were violent, abuse,        a small group, but very, very dangerous. Afterwards, they attempt to incite to violence, to fisticuffs. We saw this even yesterday after the rallies, you had the left     and its always portrayed in the media as if the violence is on our end. It never is.  Kassam noted the same media narrative is employed when Palestinians are portrayed as having been shot by Israeli soldiers for no particular reason or in the case of demonstrations against the Manchester atrocity, assaulted by     but reported by the BBC as Violence Breaks Out at   Rally.  The BBC cut out the references to Allah in that attack on the nursery school employee, where she was attacked by this Muslim mob that was screaming, Allah, Geller pointed out. The BBC is the enemy. If anybody thinks this is merely a left vs. right     this is some kind of a passive war     Rip Van Winkle, you better wake up.   This is real war, and I believe the left is evil, she said. They use ridicule, the Saul Alinsky tactics, the whole arsenal of weapons. You saw them destroy the Tea Party. You saw them destroy the EDL, okay? This is what they do, through ridicule, through smear, through defamation. But I think people are shrugging and saying, Listen, Im not having it. My children are not safe. My community is not safe. My kids cant walk to school.  Its literally a matter of life or death. Its not politics. Its life or death, Geller stressed.

"On Anniversary of Pulse Jihadi Attack, Media Replaces Radical Ideology with Generic Hate - Breitbart",Breitbart,Adelle Nazarian,6/12/2017,"On Monday, thousands are remembering the lives lost during the deadliest mass shooting in United States history, the Pulse nightclub massacre, a jihadist attack by an Islamic State sympathizer targeting the Orlando clubs Latin Night. [Omar Mateen opened fire on innocent patrons of the club, killing 49 people and injuring scores of others. Mateen pledged his allegiance to the Islamic State during the shooting before police shot him dead.  The media has made little to no mention of the fact that a jihadist, influenced by a radical Islamic ideology, was behind this crime. Instead, most of the stories in the press have painted the incident as a generic form of hate.  An article in the New Yorker about the graveyard caretaker who looks after the plots of the victims of the massacre does not mention Mateen. USA Today similarly makes no mention of Mateens radical motivations or his allegiance to a group hellbent on spreading an Islamic caliphate throughout the world. CNN ran an article highlighting five people who were either related to the victims of the Pulse massacre or survived the atrocity. CNN also failed to address the radical Islamic ideology behind the attacks. While they did mention the word terror, they chose quotes to highlight the views of those who believe in stricter gun laws, and one that blamed the incident squarely on hate.  The one person CNN quoted who believes in gun ownership as a form of protection as a result of what she survived said she does not believe in God. Its hard to say that I am here because of God because, Im sorry, I dont believe that God would take those people the way that they were taken, Jeannette McCoy told CNN. Theres nothing proud about being a survivor. Not for me.  The Washington Post also failed to make any mention of Mateens radical influence. As the Washington Free Beacon pointed out, Despite the Posts piece clocking in at over a thousand words, the words terrorism, terror, ISIS, Islam, Muslim, and   never appeared once. The sole reference to Islamic State occurs in a photo caption, and never in the body of the piece.  Breitbart News previously reported that Mateen said, I pledge allegiance to [Islamic State leader] Abu Bakr   may God protect him, on behalf of the Islamic State, during a 911 call about his assault. In that same piece, Breitbart News detailed how the media worked to portray Mr. Mateen as a scorned, mentally ill, repressed homosexual, but the reports on the incident reveal one crucial point: Omar Mateen ranted at the police about Americas fight against the Islamic State, mentioning the war and air strikes at least 20 times in total.  Several other news outlets also failed to mention the keywords that the Washington Free Beacon mentioned their sole reference to Mateen pledging allegiance to the Islamic State. They include a Toronto,   news site, CP24 and the Associated Press. However, last year, the AP ran a headine with a quote from Mateens imam who said the Pulse massacre Has Nothing To Do With ISIS and instead blamed it on mental illness. On Monday, the City of Orlando participated in what they have called Orlando United Day     A Day of Love and Kindness to honor the lives lost one year ago today. In addition to a series of events taking place in the city and throughout other cities across North America, an event at Pulse nightclub called Reflections and Remembrance began at 11 a. m. At 7 p. m. a memorial event called Orlando Love: Remembering Our Angels will take place at Lake Eola Park. The park is located at  512 East Washington Street.

NYT: Trump Helping Terrorists by Refusing to Talk Gun Control after London Knife Attacks,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/12/2017,"On June 12 the New York Times editorial board claimed that President Trump is helping terrorists by refusing to talk gun control after Londons June 3 terrorist knife attacks. [Moreover, even though terror attacks are becoming more frequent in Britain and the whole of Europe, the NYT lauds Britain for putting  civilian safety before gun rights.  How safe were the civilians who walked on London Bridge June 3? The impetus behind the NYT editorial was Trumps June 4 tweet: Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now? Thats because they used knives and a truck!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  The NYT reacted by describing Trump as the candidate of the National Rifle Association and suggested he did not want to talk gun control after the June 3 attacks because he prefers to discourage any debate in this county about the lethal role played by easily obtainable guns.  The NYT completely misses the fact that the June 3 attacks happened in London, not here, and they were carried out with knives, not guns. They also avoid connecting the dots. That is, they describe all the gun controls Britain has put in place but they fail to recognize that the controls were impotent to stop the June 3 attacks. If anything, those controls made the attacks easier to carry out because such controls meant Londoners would be defenseless. France has gun controls which are very similar to those in Britain, yet in 2015 alone terrorists were able to shoot 142 Parisians to death. This is why Trump spent time on the campaign trail stressing that gun control is not the answer but an armed citizenry is at least part of the answer. During a January 10, 2016, appearance on Meet the Press, Trump stressed that terrorists need to feel the sting of bullets being shot back at them. He said: If in Paris or if in California recently, where the 14 people were killed and probably others to follow   in terms of that group because you have some people who are very, very badly wounded   if in Paris they had guns or if in California [they had guns,] on the other side, where the bullets go both ways, not just in one direction. You wouldnt have had the kind of carnage that you had. Gun control is not the answer. London has gun control   the whole of Europe has gun control   and they also have   terror attacks, knife attacks, truck attacks, and hammer attacks. They face attacks from rudimentary weapons and those attacks are often successful because they people lack a means to defend themselves.

Bill Cosby Awaits Fate as Jury Begins Deliberations in Sex Assault Trial,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/12/2017,"NORRISTOWN, Pa. (AP)     The jury at Bill Cosbys trial began deliberating Monday over whether he drugged and molested a woman more than a decade ago in a case that has already helped demolish the    comedians   image. [A conviction could send Cosby to prison for the rest of his life, completing the stunning   downfall of one of the most beloved stars in show business.  The   case went to the jury of seven men and five women on Day 6 of the trial after closing arguments gave differing portrayals of what happened between Cosby and Andrea Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate. Defense attorney Brian McMonagle told the jury that Cosby and Constand were lovers who had enjoyed secret romantic interludes and that the 2004 encounter was consensual. McMonagle said that while the comedian had been unfaithful to his wife, he didnt commit a crime. Prosecutors countered by saying fancy lawyering cant save Cosby from his own words     namely, his admission about groping Constand after giving her pills he knew could put her to sleep. Drugging somebody and putting them in a position where you can do what you want with them is not romantic. Its criminal, District Attorney Kevin Steele said. Jurors got the case around 5:30 p. m. deliberated for about 90 minutes before ordering dinner, and then asked to see a portion of Cosbys   testimony from a civil suit filed against him by Constand. Jurors told the judge that they wanted to hear the full context of Cosbys testimony about the pills he gave to Constand, which he had described to her as friends.  I have three friends for you to make you relax, Cosby said he told Constand, according to a deposition transcript reread to the jury Monday night. After the prosecution took five days to outline its side, the defense case consisted of just one witness, a detective, and six minutes of testimony Monday. Cosby did not take the stand, ending days of suspense over whether the jury would hear directly from him. Legal experts said testifying would have been a risky move that could have opened the TV star to withering   about some of the 60 or so other women who have accused him of drugging or molesting them. He is charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each one punishable by up to 10 years behind bars. The black comedian once known as Americas Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on The Cosby Show suggested recently that race could have played a role in the case against him. The jury included two black members. McMonagle, in his closing argument, tried to sow doubt about Constands story, saying it had evolved during her interviews with police. He also pointed out that Constand telephoned Cosby dozens of times after the alleged assault. Constand told the jury she was merely returning his calls about the womens basketball squad at Temple University, where she was director of team operations and he was a member of the board of trustees. This isnt talking to a trustee. This is talking to a lover, McMonagle said of one call that lasted 49 minutes. Why are we running from the truth of this case     this relationship? Why? Cosbys wife of 53 years, Camille, was in the courtroom for the first time in the trial. She was stoic during the defense argument but left when it was the prosecutions turn. She sat in the front row, across the aisle from Constand, who didnt react to McMonagles   closing but smiled at the end of it. Constand, 44, testified last week that Cosby gave her three blue pills and then penetrated her with his fingers against her will as she lay paralyzed and  . She denied they had a romantic relationship and said she had rebuffed previous advances from him. She sued Cosby after prosecutors in 2005 declined to press charges. Cosby testified over a decade ago as part of that lawsuit, eventually settling with her for an undisclosed sum. His deposition was sealed for years until a judge released parts in 2015 at the request of The Associated Press, prompting a new set of prosecutors to take a fresh look at the case and charge him. McMonagle told the jury that Cosbys freedom is at stake now, not just his finances. This is not a civil case about money, money, money. Were talking about all the mans tomorrows, he said. In the prosecutions closing argument, Steele said that Cosbys lurid statements from 2005 helped corroborate Constands allegations. Steele also reminded jurors about a telephone conversation in which Cosby apologized to Constands mother and described himself as a sick man.  This is where all the fancy lawyering cant get you around your own words, Steele said. In his 2005 deposition, Cosby said he obtained several prescriptions for quaaludes in the 1970s and offered the   sedatives to women he wanted to have sex with. He also said he gave Constand three   of the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl before the petting began. Prosecutors have suggested he drugged her with something stronger     perhaps quaaludes. The Associated Press does not typically identify people who say they are victims of sexual assault unless they grant permission, which Constand has done."
Convicted Terrorist Oscar Lpez Rivera Booed at NYC Puerto Rican Day Parade,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/12/2017,"NEW YORK CITY     Convicted terrorist Oscar Lpez Rivera made his controversial appearance at the annual National Puerto Rican Day Parade Sunday     and was met by a mix of cheers and boos from the polarized crowd. [The parade had been overshadowed for months by the parade committees decision to honor Lpez Rivera, a key member of the radical Marxist Armed Forces of National Liberation (FALN) in the seventies and eighties, who fought for Puerto Rican independence. The group conducted more than 100 bombings in the United States, killing five people, injuring dozens, and causing millions of dollars worth of damage. Lpez Rivera was convicted.  President Obama commuted Lpez Riveras sentence, and he was released this year after serving 35 years for transporting guns and bomb materials. The committees decision to honor the militant as a national freedom hero led a wealth of sponsors,  including   the New York Yankees, and Univisin, to pull out, along with NYPD and FDNY officials and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo. Lpez Rivera, who has denied being a terrorist, eventually said he would forgo the honor but would march as a humble Puerto Rican and grandfather.  But the New York Daily News  reported that, while some at the parade cheered Lpez Rivera and held signs calling him our Mandela, others booed and jeered the convicted terrorist. According to the paper, one Bronx resident yelled, Fuck Oscar! Fuck him! Hes no hero! as the   leader passed. Nearby cops reportedly shook their heads in agreement. Several cops gave Lpez Rivera and Democratic City Council Speaker Melissa   who was on the float with him,  sour looks, according to the Daily News. I wouldnt be here if I wasnt working. We gotta do our jobs, man, said one officer. This really pisses me off, Bronx resident Mark Rivera told the New York Post. This is a day for honoring the Republic of Puerto Rico, not honoring a terrorist. This man has no place in our parade. He makes me ashamed to be a Puerto Rican.

NBC Freaking Out over Ratings Disaster Megyn Kelly: Report - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/12/2017,"NBC is reportedly freaking out because the networks   talent Megyn Kelly has already been a ratings disaster.   They didnt pay her $15 million for this. They are now worried that her numbers will be bad when she joins the 9 am hour of Today, a source reportedly told Radar Online. If Kelly tanks at 9 am she will also bring down Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb at 10 am.  The debut of Kellys Sunday Night With Megyn Kelly, with its   Vladimir Putin interview, could not even beat out a rerun of 60 Minutes. Her second show got clobbered as well. As Radar Online noted, Kellys interview with Erin Andrews was destroyed by 60 Minutes, which scored 7. 66 million total viewers. Kelly got a paltry 4. 35 million people to tune in to her program.  Already in desperation mode, NBC is reportedly scrambling to land big gets like Kathy Griffin or Adrianna Grande because, according to the source, the network seems to have already determined that people are not tuning in to watch Megyn without huge guests.  After reportedly being rejected multiple times, Kelly finally found a producer for her daily   morning show just last Friday. Veteran producer Jackie Levin agreed to produce the show, which is set to debut in September. NBC News reportedly had trouble locking down an executive producer for Kellys daily   show for months. According to one television insider, though NBC and Megyn Kelly would like you to believe her show did not have an executive producer because there are just so many great people lining up for the job, it was quite the opposite.  According to the insiders source, Kelly and NBC had approached some big names and they have all said no.  Kelly reportedly wanted Bill Geddie, Barbara Walters longtime producer, to run her morning show. But he reportedly turned her down in addition to other top names because no one wants to take the gig and most of the blame if Kelly flops at NBC.  NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack has reportedly been busy lowering expectations for Kelly to the networks affiliates. When news of NBCs hiring of Kelly broke, one executive reportedly said that the degree of difficulty would be extremely high for Kelly and if she does not succeed, she could end up fading into obscurity, especially since her trial run at Fox News for a   show was panned and got terrible ratings."
Elizabeth Warren: Sessions Needs to Be Fired - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/12/2017,"Monday on CNNs The Axe Files, a podcast from the University of Chicago, Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) said Attorney General Jeff Sessions needed to be fired.   Sessions is testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee Tuesday, where he will be questioned about Former FBI Director James Comeys testimony last week about the attorney generals role in Comeys meetings with President Donald Trump. Sessions recused himself from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election because he failed to disclose two meetings with the Russian ambassador during his confirmation hearings. In referring to the incident where Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell ( ) shut down Warren for criticizing Sessions, she said, I opposed Sessions for being Attorney General of the United States. And you may remember, I got sent away from the Senate for that and got shut down and not allowed to speak again until after the vote. That was the rule. I could not speak again until the Senate had had a chance to vote on Jeff Sessions.  She added, He needs to be fired. He needs to be taken out of that job.

Mexican Soccer Fans Boo the Star Spangled Banner at World Cup Qualifier - Breitbart,Breitbart,Robert J. Marlow,6/12/2017,"Mexican fans booed, jeered, and whistled during the Star Spangled Banner on Sunday before a   soccer contest between our southern neighbors and Team USA. [The outrageous behavior by the thousands of fans tainted the World Cup Qualifier, which was held at Estadio Azteca in Mexico City.   Both of the bordering nations walked away from the match without a victory but tied at  . The only losers at the stadium were the Mexican supporters who chose an important international game to disgrace themselves by failing to respect another countrys flag. The American and the Mexican teams showed some respect for each other when they met in Columbus, Ohio, in November agreeing to share a pregame unity photo, reported USA Today.  However, during Sundays game, Mexican fans showed their disfavor for America and its president, donning   and carrying banners with  . S. messages. The negative reaction by Mexicans to President Trumps intention to build a wall to stop illegal immigration is highly hypocritical. The Red Cross has protested rampant police corruption, intimidation, and bribery schemes targeting illegal aliens [in Mexico] for years, reports the National Review. One Mexican Soccer fan, Francisco Cisneros Solano, 27, posed for pictures with friends wearing a   with, (Expletive) Trump.  I did it just for the humor, he told USA Today Sports. But this game is the biggest one of all for us (in qualifying).  Mexico soccer team supporter Hector Rivera said, We have nothing against the American team apart from the fact we want to beat them.   He added, But it is nice for us to say something to (Trump).  USA Coach Bruce Arena shared his opinion on the issue of the highly charged political climate between the two countries. Im ashamed that theres perhaps some discord on the political side, Arena said. But believe me I think most Americans appreciate the Mexicans that have come to America to make a better future for themselves and their families and the way they have contributed. We have the greatest respect for Mexico, its people, its football team. I live in Los Angeles. I experience on a daily basis people of Mexican heritage. Theyre wonderful people, they contribute greatly to our society in many ways. We think the world of them."

[Kelly shared a preview clip of the interview with Jones on her Twitter account Sunday.  In the clip, Jones defends against being called the most paranoid man in the world, calls the September 11 terrorist attacks in the U.

Teen Vogue Calls The March Against Sharia Hate Speech - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/12/2017,"magazine Teen Vogue called ACT for Americas nationwide March Against Sharia protests hate speech. [The protests     which took place in more than 20 cities, including New York, Dallas, and Atlanta     were an example of hateful speech as a free speech issue.   For example, on the question of sharia     the topic of Saturdays marches     there is wide space for people to learn more about what sharia is, Asma Uddin and Firdaus Arastu wrote in an   for Teen Vogue. For many Americans, it sounds scary     we hear tales of a system where hands are chopped off and adulterers are stoned. But this is not the sharia of America.  Sharia is a set of legal rules that deal with a range of issues from the minutia of washing hands and feet to purify oneself before prayer to inheritance rules. Its also about spirituality, Uddin and Arastu wrote. Sharia Law is the brutal and often oppressive   islamic law, practiced, in varying degrees, in several   countries     Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Qatar, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Sudan. Such barbaric tenants of Shariah Law, including imprisonment or death for apostasy (abandoning Islam) mental and physical subjugation of women, and genital mutilation of girls are still practiced throughout the Muslim world. Act For America Founder and Chairman and leading terrorism expert Brigitte Gabriel wrote, in a recent Breitbart News article, that her organizations protests were about protecting women and children from Sharia law and its impact on Muslim women and children, including honor killing and Female Genital Mutilation.

Madrid Buses Ban Men Manspreading - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/12/2017,"MADRID (AP)     If youre taking a bus in the Spanish capital, be sure to keep your legs to yourself. [Madrid authorities on Monday started putting up signs banning the practice of manspreading     opening ones legs so wide you invade others seating space    on city buses as part of their new etiquette guidelines.  EMT municipal transportation company says the sign is designed to discourage physical postures that bother people. The sign features an illustration of a man with splayed legs with a red X above. The text beneath urges passengers to respect the space of others.  There are no sanctions or fines for those indulging in the practice. The bus company incorporated the ban following an internet signature campaign by a womans group, Mujeres en Lucha (Fighting Women). In their campaign petition, the women said it was a very common practice.  La @EMTmadrid aade una nueva seal a bordo del bus para evitar el #manspreading: Respeta el espacio de los dems. https:  .  pic. twitter.      Ayuntamiento Madrid (@MADRID) June 6, 2017,  Its not difficult to see women with their legs closed and very uncomfortable because theres a man beside them whos invading their space with their legs, it added. The group said women were taught to sit with their legs together whereas men are ingrained with the idea of territorial hierarchy, as if the space belongs to them.  EMT said it felt its initiative, which also includes asking passengers not to eat or drink on buses, to keep their backpacks on or put their feet up on seats, was being well received. Again, there are no sanctions for any of these other requests. When a person opens their legs so wide it disturbs others, this is rude, said Alvaro Gomez Jordana Moya, 60, as he waited for a bus in Madrid. Its also uncomfortable having to ask someone, Please, can you close your legs.  Its a problem because people dont respect seating, said another bus passenger Maria Carmen Ventosa, 46. It should change things, if only out of respect for others.  Madrids underground train company said it had no plans to follow suit."
EXCLUSIVE: Ted Cruz Suggests U.S. Military Response to Mexican Cartels,Breitbart,Brandon Darby,6/12/2017,"LUBBOCK, Texas     U. S. Senator Ted Cruz suggested that the U. S. military should be used against Mexican transnational criminal groups (cartels). The statements were made during a    interview with the senator at the end of May at the Bayer Museum of Agriculture in Lubbock, Texas. The senator made clear that he was not suggesting unilateral U. S. military action in Mexico, but rather a cooperative effort, as seen in Colombia. [The portion of the interview pertaining to Mexican cartels follows.  BRANDON DARBY: One of the things thats very interesting about Texas on the border, as you know, theres nine sectors on the Southwest Border, five of which are in Texas. Part of the problem that we have in Texas is that two of the most brutal criminal groups south of the border, which actually operate north of the border as well, as you know, are Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel. But unlike most of the other criminal organizations in Mexico along our border, which would be Sinaloa, Juarez Cartel, Tijuana Cartel. Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel are extremely brutal. In fact, the videos they release resemble ISIS videos. We try to challenge them as much as possible, but what more could the U. S. do? Theres talk of declaring certain factions as foreign terror organizations so you could appropriately go after the money and the politicians. Again, Tamaulipas, a state below Texas, the last two governors are fugitives from U. S. justice for being surrogates of the Gulf Cartel. Several of the governors in Coahuila are now in trouble because they were Los Zetas. What more could the U. S. do to to challenge Mexican transnational criminal groups who operate in our country, who kill our kids? What could we do to challenge them? SEN. TED CRUZ: We could do a great deal more. What has happened in the last decade with Mexican drug cartels has been nothing short of tragic. Mexico is a great and wonderful country. The Mexican people are wonderful people. Growing up in Texas, we spent a great deal of time in Mexico. Most Texans have long and deep commitments to Mexico. Whether family ties, or business ties, or cultural ties. Where Texans vacation in Mexico. Mexicans vacation in Texas. In the past decade, we have seen the control and reign of terror of the cartels wreak enormous damage to the nation of Mexico. Where ordinary citizens are terrified for their lives. Where crime and kidnapping becomes almost routine and the corruption that goes hand and hand with billions of dollars of illegal narcotic trafficking resources combined with vicious violent transnational criminal cartels has done enormous damage to Mexico and enormous damage to America. What can we do about it? One of the things I think we should explore very seriously is something along the lines of what we did in Colombia: Plan Colombia. Where President George W. Bush worked with President Uribe to target the cartels and take them out. It was treated less as a law enforcement matter than as a military matter. Where our military went into Colombia and helped destroy the cartels. It did so on the invitation of the Colombian government. Look, we should not engage in a military action in Mexico without the active cooperation of the duly elected government there. DARBY: Im going to interrupt you and I apologize for doing so. How do, this is the issue with Mexico: Mexicos ruling political party, the PRI, is in fact largely funded by transnational criminal organizations. The current Mexican president, Pea Nieto, and I dont expect you to respond to it. Im saying. He was largely put into office by money from the Juarez Cartel. The line between Mexican cartel and Mexican political leader on the highest levels is so fine, if even maybe nonexistent. How do you do that in a country where theres so much public corruption? CRUZ: Its an enormous challenge and rule of law in Mexico is profoundly imperiled. Where the justice system doesnt operate. Where far too many of the police and the prosecutors and the judges are corrupt. Where cartel enforcers, even if they are apprehended, are released within hours. It creates an environment that makes it profoundly difficult for government leaders to take on the corruption. We need American leadership to try to work to find Mexican government officials willing to do so and we need to use the tools we have in our country to secure the borders and shut down the trafficking. Shut down the narcotics trafficking, the human trafficking. And do everything we can to protect the American citizenry from the enormous damage being inflicted by the cartels.

Ivanka Trump Surprised by Level of Viciousness in Washington D.C.,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/12/2017,"Ivanka Trump said she was surprised by the level of viciousness in Washington, D. C. after her family moved to the city to join her father President Donald Trump in the White House. [It is hard and there is a level of viciousness that I was not expecting, she admitted in an interview with Fox and Friends. I was not expecting the intensity of this experience.   Trump made an appearance on the network to discuss her work on job training and skills based education to help people looking for work. Im trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people, Trump said, reminding viewers that life was more difficult for people who were laid off or for a mother that lost their child to opioid abuse. My fathers administration intends to be transformative and we want to do big, bold things. Were looking to change the status quo, she said. President Trump will travel with his daughter Ivanka to a technical school in Wisconsin this week to highlight the importance of   education and apprenticeships. Ivanka Trump said she was also surprised by the amount of photographers outside her home in Washington, D. C. That is a weird experience, she laughed. Im looking for alternative routes out of my home but you know, there is a scrutiny and there is an interest that exceeds anything that Ive ever experienced before."
"There are only two rules  Facebook explains how hackathons, one of its oldest traditions, is also one of its most important",Business Insider,Matt Weinberger,6/12/2017,"If youve ever tagged a friend in the comments of a Facebook post, changed the  or even used the Like button, youve benefitted from one of the social networks oldest traditions: the .  As you may guess from the name, a hackathon is a coding marathon where teams work together to finish a project over the span of a night, day, or weekend. And theyve been intrinsic to how Facebook does business for the last decade. Sometimes, those projects end up turning into viable products, like those famous examples above. Usually, these projects are   and end up only used interally at Facebook. Often, theyre just plain weird. At a Facebook hackathon, the only criteria is that whatever your project happens to be, youre passionate about it. There are only two rules: You have to work on something outside your day job, and if its your first hackathon, you have to hack, former Facebook director of engineering Pedram Keyani . Last week, Facebook threw a special hackathon to commemorate the 10th anniversary of its platform for developers. I got invited to attend, where I talked to a few   Facebook executives about the history of the hackathon     and why a Facebook without hackathons wouldnt be Facebook at all.  The most famous Facebook hackathon was held the This special event ran overnight, all the way up until Mark Zuckerberg rang the opening bell at the NYSE. The idea, then, was to signal that even though Facebook was now a   company, it hadnt lost sight of its roots.  In Facebooks first few years, hackathons were just an informal thing that Zuckerberg and his team did sometimes. But gradually they became more of a ritual as leadership looked to promote   even as Facebooks ranked swelled. Over the years, there have been at least 50 Facebook hackathons. Every six weeks or so, Facebook employees would gather after work at a construction crane at its old campus in Palo Alto. Then it was off to an   coding session, with Chinese food provided by Facebook. All participants got a   themed to the particular hackathon. That tradition carries through to this day. When I attended Facebooks   hackathon last week, it was at an upscale event venue in San Franciscos    Dogpatch neighborhood. Instead of an     it was spread across two days, for about 10 hours a day, with most engineers finishing before time was up. And the Chinese food had been replaced by   hot food catering, complete with a coffee bar. But the spirit of the event hasnt changed at all, Im told. Hackathons are largely the same now as they were 10 years ago or longer, says Facebook director of product management Eddie ONeil, whos been with the company since 2011. The crane was even moved onto the current campus. A few years ago, it was decided that Facebook was simply too huge to regularly run   hackathons. Now, each department within the company runs their own hackathon events. This   hackathon was thrown by the Facebook developer platform     which is fitting since the platform itself started as a hackathon project. To Facebook VP of platform and marketplace Deb Liu, the challenge of the Facebook hackathon isnt so much about technical skill, as it about passion: In two days, what can you convince people to be excited about?  Thats the beauty of the hackathon, by Lius reckoning. The best hackathon projects come about when someone in the company identifies a problem, and recruits others to work on it with them.  A lot of times, its a passion for them, says Liu. It might not even be their own product [that they hack on].  Its a mental break from the daily grind, a chance to meet fellow employees, and an opportunity to drop everything and fix whatever needs fixing. Regardless of your job title, or your seniority level, you can join a project or create one, Liu says. Its just a mental health break, says Liu.  Facebook director of engineering Vijaye Raji says chasing your passion can make a big splash. He recalls that, circa 2012, he presented a better way of working on Facebooks code to Mark Zuckerberg and his team     an experience that was as nervewracking as it sounds. They thought it was so cool, and passed it off to the right team to take to fruition. Five years later, the ideas in Rajis prototype are still part of Facebooks standard tools. The impact was huge, says Raji. That passion can manifest itself in   ways, too. While flashy Facebook features like and came out of prior hackathons, a lot of the most successful projects are quieter.  At this particular hackathon, everyone was welcome: In addition to the usual roster of programmers and designers, a team of office administrators had enlisted some Facebook developers for their own hackathon project. Over the course of a previous hackathon, those office administrators had come up with a hack that would show them which office any given employee in the directory was working out of. At this hackathon, the team came up a version 2, which also showed the names of the administrative assistant assigned to any executive.  For instance, I talked to Facebook software engineer Matthew Robertson, who normally works on the companys server infrastructure. At Facebooks recent F8 conference, outside developers mentioned to him that the companys API documentation     basically, the instruction manuals for building software that integrates with Facebook      was lacking. This documentation is outside of his normal responsibilities. Still, he had an idea on how to improve it. So when the hackathon rolled around, he recruited 10 or so of his colleagues to help him prototype an upgrade. His version would include an interactive element, so developers could play with the code without leaving Facebooks documentation websites.  This has been on my radar for a while, says Robertson. A major ancillary benefit of the hackathon, beyond just coming up with ways to improve Facebook, is around preserving the companys famous values around the hacker way. At a lot of tech companies, increased age and size means an increasingly fractured company culture. Facebook sees the hackathon as a way to avoid that fate. When a company thinks in too many values, its easy to lose sight of them, says Raji.  A major aspect of that is how it encourages developers to look to each other for help and support. Liu describes the hackathon as a way for teams who dont work together, to work together. ONeil describes the hackathon as the connective tissue that keeps Facebook teams on the same page.  Even after the hackathon is complete, Liu says, Facebook employees stay in touch. And later, down the line, if an engineer remembers that they met an ace designer, or database expert, or frontend engineer at a hackathon who would be perfect for their project, they can give them a call. We want to constantly be learning from each other, says Liu. If youve ever tagged a friend in the comments. .."
Exclusive: Dennis Rodman heading to North Korea,CNN,Joshua Berlinger,6/12/2017,"Hong Kong and Washington (CNN) NBA Hall of Famer Dennis Rodman is expected to arrive in North Korea Tuesday, according to two officials in that country who spoke to CNN.  CNN spotted Rodman at Beijing International Airport, where he declined to answer questions. Rodman would be arriving in Pyongyang at a time of heightened tension between Washington and Pyongyang, which is currently detaining four Americans. Its unclear what the purpose of Rodmans visit to the secretive country could be, but the eccentric former basketball player    and a former contestant on Donald Trumps   reality TV show Celebrity Apprentice    is one of the only Americans to have met current North Korean Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. When asked by CNN journalists in Pyongyang, unnamed North Korean officials confirmed that Rodman is expected to arrive in Pyongyang Tuesday. They gave no further details. Basketball diplomacy, Rodman has visited the country at least four times, with three of the visits taking place between 2013 and 2014. A senior US official said the State Department was aware Rodman was planning to travel to North Korea, but stressed he is not there in any official capacity.   His last visit came in January 2014, when Rodman and a group of other former NBA players took part in an exhibition basketball game. It was supposedly a birthday gift for Kim whos said to be a big basketball fan.  Rodman was filmed leading a   of Happy Birthday to the North Korean leader, a man he calls a friend and a very good guy, but is widely seen as a brutal dictator who once lauded the execution of his own uncle. Rodman has described his series of trips to North Korea as a basketball diplomacy project and defended the trip for Kims birthday in a CNN interview saying it was a great idea for the world. Im sorry for whats going on in North Korea, the certain situations, Rodman told CNN after returning from Pyongyang in 2014, but he didnt specify what exactly those situations were and wasnt contrite about the visit itself. That trip generated a string of negative headlines and an outburst from Rodman during the CNN interview. He was heavily criticized in the US for not bringing up the case of Kenneth Bae, an American imprisoned on charges of hostile acts who spent 735 days in North Korean custody before being released in 2014. When Rodman left Beijings airport on Monday, he was wearing a black   with the logo of Potcoin    a digital currency for the cannabis industry, according to its website.  The company later tweeted images of Rodman at the airport with the message, Stay tuned.   prison camps, Rodman maintained then that he wasnt a diplomat, and it wasnt his job to talk about Bae. But once he was released, Bae thanked Rodman for the rant on CNN, claiming it brought attention to his case.  The former basketball star was also accused of ignoring North Koreas human rights record. Pyongyang has reportedly imprisoned more than 100, 000 of its own people in draconian,   prison camps and spends millions on its military programs instead of its impoverished population.  This time around, four Americans are being held in North Korea, including Kim Sang Duk and Kim   two academics who worked at the Pyongyang University of Science and Technology University of Virginia student Otto Warmbier and businessman Kim Dong Chul. A new visit?  Rodmans expected visit to Pyongyang would be the first under Trump, a man with whom he has a personal relationship. Before entering politics, Trump praised one of Rodmans 2013 trips to North Korea in an interview with Fox News. Rodman, who appeared on Trumps reality TV show in 2009 and again in 2013, went on to endorse Trumps candidacy in 2015. But relations between Pyongyang and Washington were considerably less tense in 2013 than they have been in recent months. North Korea has fired 16 missiles this year. Experts say each launch gets the country closer to its stated goal of developing a   weapon capable of reaching the United States.  North Korea believes its missile program is the only way to deter Washington from trying to overthrow the Kim regime. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson denied that charge last month, saying the US is only seeking denuclearization, but the Trump White House has publicly abandoned the   strategy of strategic patience.  Trump weighed in on Twitter last month that North Korea is looking for trouble and urged China to help. If not, we will solve the problem without them! U. S. A. he added.  The Worm and the dictator, Kims passion for basketball was likely inherited from his father, Kim Jong Il, and has been a rare area of common ground for the two nations.  Madeleine Albright, the US Secretary of State under President Bill Clinton, brought Kim a basketball autographed by Michael Jordan during a visit in 2000.  Nicknamed The Worm, Rodman won two championships with the Detroit Pistons and three with the Chicago Bulls. On the court he was known for his ferocious defense and rebounding ability. But he grabbed just as much attention off the court for his piercings,   hair and   antics. On his first trip to North Korea, Rodman was accompanied by members of the Harlem Globetrotters and a crew from VICE News. RELATED: Dennis Rodman Fast Facts  I come in peace. I love the people of North Korea! Rodman said on Twitter as he arrived. The group traveled for a basketball exhibition that pitted the Americans against North Koreans. Though the game ended in a   tie, all eyes were on the jarring sight of the rebellious    ball player sitting next to the the short,   dictator in a Mao suit. Rodman told Kim he has a friend for life. The purposes of Rodmans visits to North Korea have never been fully transparent. Hes claimed some were about trying to use basketball to bridge the divide between the two countries. But another was strictly about the game and for the love of basketball."
Exclusive - Pro-Trump VA Gov Candidate Corey Stewart Makes Final Appeal to Populist Voters on Eve of Primary - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/12/2017,"Former Virginia chairman of the Donald Trump for President campaign and candidate for Virginia governor Corey Stewart spoke to Breitbart News Monday as voters prepare to go to the polls in Tuesdays GOP primary. [Stewart has campaigned as an   Trumpian populist, placing the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his policy portfolio and rousing the ire of the mainstream media and the political left with his steadfast defense of Virginias numerous monuments to its Confederate war heroes.  I led the nations toughest crackdown on illegal immigration in 2007. Its still in place today. So far we have handed over to the federal government more than 7, 500 criminal illegal aliens, Stewart told Breitbart News, referring to his time as a Prince William County Supervisor where he first came to national notice for his introduction of a county policy requiring police to look into the immigration status of those they arrest. Stewart continued his pitch for serious immigration enforcement, focusing on the transnational criminal gangs that have been terrorizing Virginia, committing a string of gruesome crimes evocative of their central American origins across the state. Stewart said: I am determined to put in place the toughest statewide crackdown on illegal aliens in the country in Virginia, especially rooting out and destroying  . I am going to do that through the 287( g) authority, which would mandate that every locality, every jail in the state will check immigration status        and hand inmates over to the federal government if theyre here illegally. Stewart sought to draw a contrast between his own immigration agenda and that of his main opponent in the GOP primary, putative   and narrowly defeated 2014 U. S. Senate Candidate Ed Gillespie, whom he called a squish Republican despite his own pledges to be tough on immigration. Stewart has hit Gillespie for serving as a lobbyist for Tysons Food as it was charged, and later acquitted, in a human smuggling investigation in connection with its labor practices. Tysons widespread use of refugee and   immigrant labor has continued to come under criticism from   immigration groups. Ed was paid money not only to downplay human smuggling charges, but also to lobby for amnesty, Stewart told Breitbart News. Thats not being tough on illegal immigration, thats being complicit in illegal immigration.  He never reneged on his statement that he supports the Gang of Eight amnesty, Stewart continued, referencing Gillespies   endorsement of a path to citizenship on CNBCs Larry Kudlow. The Amnesty for twelve million illegals, he called it good politics and good policy.  Gillespie also told Kudlow in that 2013 interview that the Gang of Eight bill was not perfect.  His campaign website insists he was never supportive of the bills amnesty provisions. Gillespie campaign spokesman David Abrhams took issue with Gillespies characterization on his immigration record. Were done commenting on Coreys constant stream of attacks, fabrications and falsehoods. Eds focused on the issues that matter to the voters of Virginia, and were looking forward to tomorrows primary, he told Breitbart News. While Stewarts hardline immigration stances have caused sparks between him and his GOP primary opponents Gillespie and State Senator Frank Wagner, it is the controversy surrounding his defense of Virginias Confederate heritage that pushed his campaign into the pages of the national press. The issue exploded this spring, as cities like New Orleans began to tear down   monuments built to the southern heroes of the War Between the States to the applause of civil rights groups like the Southern Poverty Law Center and their allies in both major political parties. In Virginia     cradle of the Confederate capital birthplace of such   revered generals as Robert E. Lee, J. E. B. Stuart, and Thomas Stonewall Jackson host to almost all of the   conflicts most   battlefields and source of more Confederate war dead than any state     the march to erase the  ugly Confederate past ran into an obstacle. In Charlottesville, home to University of Virginia, which a little over 150 years ago provided the Confederate Army with more than 1, 400 officers including slavery opponent and pioneer of mobile warfare John Mosby, the city councils efforts to remove   statutes of Lee and Jackson were met with lawsuits and defiant protests. Stewart, alone among prominent politicians, stood, much to the chagrin of the mainstream media, with those who sought to preserve the reverent memory of the Confederate dead of the Old Dominion. Outlets like Politico and the Washington Post quickly published dismissive pieces on Stewart linking him to racial hatred when he refused to condemn the monuments and those who defended them. Stewarts likely opponent in Novembers general election should he win Tuesdays primary, Democratic   Tom Perriello, made a stand with the leftist agitators and liberal local governments calling for the widespread removal of historic Confederate monuments across the state, accusing Stewart of touting an ignorant,   view of Virginia with his insistence they be left alone and calling the Confederacy our greatest sin.  Perriello later tweeted that Stewart was a Confederate apologist trying to use racism to score political points, as he used the incident to hit his   general election opponent Gillespie, who had said he would vote for Stewart if he won the primary instead of him. Not even a Confederate apologist trying to use racism to score political points can draw condemnation from @EdWGillespie. Says it all. https:  .      Tom Perriello (@tomperriello) April 25, 2017,  What Ive found is that those liberal like Tom Perriello who preach tolerence are some of the most intolerant people there are. He is intolerent and has a hatred and disgust of Virginias heritage and history, Stewart said to the implication: Anyone trying to destroy [the monuments] is trying to rewrite and erase our history for their own ends. Im trying to defend it and for that he calls me a bigot and a racist and  . Im not trying to live in the past        but that doesnt mean we let go of our culture and of our values, and doesnt mean that we denigrate those men who fought to protect Virginia. Asked what he thought Perriellos own view of Virginia was, in contrast to the ignorant,   once ascribed to him, Stewart replied: Tom Perriellos vision for Virginia is transgender bathrooms at every rest stop, every school, and every business, millions of illegal aliens coming into Virginia taking peoples jobs, committing crimes and then not having them deported. His vision is having more restrictive environmental regulations on Virginia businesses and continued job losses. His vision is the shutdown of the coal industry in southwestern Virginia. His vision is misery and poverty. Perriellos campaign declined to comment for this article. Polling for the race had put Stewart well behind Gillespie. A poll released Sunday by new   firm Change Research, however, has Stewart with a narrow lead and up by nine points against his GOP rivals among the voters who will definitely vote for their preferred candidate. Breitbart News could not independently verify the methodology of this poll, but the same outfit forecasted Greg Gianfortes victory in his special election for Montanas U. S. House seat within one point the actual result. Polling places open Tuesday at 6am and are open until 7pm."
Ex-SF Mayor Willie Brown Warns Dems: Pushing Trump Impeachment Could Backfire - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/12/2017,"Former San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown warned Democrats that pushing for President Donald Trumps impeachment could backfire.  As tempting as it is for the Democrats to push the idea that Trump could be guilty of obstruction of justice and push for impeachment, that could ultimately backfire on them   it raises public expectations, but if it doesnt happen, it looks like you tried to do something and failed, Brown wrote in his San Francisco Chronicle column over the weekend. That wouldnt just hurt the party this time. If a real Trump scandal comes along, the Democrats will be haunted by a decision to spend their political capital and credibility on a scandal that came up short.  The legendary California Democrat said the facts are not there yet to make the case for impeachment. He added that former FBI director James Comeys testimony was great entertainment, but for all the hype, the Senate Intelligence Committee hearings did not deliver a knockout punch.  You are not going to get another All the Presidents Men out of this story, he said, adding that so far, there is no silver bullet that will bring the president down.  California Democrats like Reps. Brad Sherman ( ) and Maxine Get Ready for Impeachment Waters ( ) have been leading the charge for impeachment. Rep. Ted Lieu ( ) has publicly stated that he is reading up on impeachment. And potential gubernatorial candidate and liberal megadonor Tom Steyer has also called for Trumps impeachment. Browns advice to Democrats: Let the questions hang out there in the publics mind, and leave the speculation to MSNBC."
A very weird and peculiar thing: Preet Bharara describes Trumps unusual attempts to forge a relationship,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/12/2017,"Former   US attorney Preet Bharara on Sunday described   several unusual interactions he had with President Donald Trump   following the 2016 election.     In an Bharara said Trump called   him during the presidential transition just to shoot the   breeze, and described the calls as a little bit uncomfortable   considering the US attorneys mandate to remain impartial toward   subjects within his jurisdiction, which included Trump.     Bharara, who earned a reputation as the Sheriff of Wall Street,   said he suspected the president attempted to forge a relationship   between the two men.     Bharara compared his interactions to those former FBI Director   James Comey said he had in his  in which Trump attempted to   forge a closer bond between himself and Comey, who was   investigating members of the Trump campaign at the time.     Theyre unusual phone calls and it sort of     when Ive been   reading the stories of how the president has been contacting Jim   Comey over time, felt a little bit like deja vu, Bharara said.     The former US attorney for the Southern District of New York also   said  the day before  but Bharara said he felt   that it would be inappropriate to return the call, and reported   to the attorney generals office that Trump was trying to   cultivate some kind of relationship.     Bharara explained that he and the other US attorneys sought to   have some kind of arms length relationship with the president   in order to stay impartial in the event they investigated   interests related to Trump. Bharara also pointed out that during   his presidency, President Barack Obama never called him.     Im not saying that he was going to ask me about a case,   although there was some evidence in the record now that after a   period of time, given the Jim Comey testimony, theres some   evidence that Donald Trump didnt think anything of asking a high   level law enforcement official to take a particular action that   he wanted for himself on a criminal case, Bharara said.     He pointed out that Trump frequently blasted former President   Bill Clinton for  at an   airport last year, which raised questions about Lynchs ability   to remain impartial in investigating Hillary Clintons use of a   private email server:     Trumps decision to fire Bharara earlier this year raised   eyebrows, as many critics pointed out that Trump . Bharara was also    at the time he   was fired,  Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Prices   stock trades.     tttWATCH: In 7. 5 years  never received a phone call from Pres Obama.

"Moms Demand Pushes #DisarmHate For Orlando Pulse, but Everyone in Pulse Was Disarmed - Breitbart",Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/12/2017,"For the   anniversary of the heinous attack on Orlando Pulse nightclub, Moms Demand Action is pushing a #DisarmHate campaign. In so doing, they fail to note that everyone in Pulse was disarmed it was a   zone. [This is one of the inconvenient truths the gun control movement does not acknowledge because it is hard to push gun control on the back of a heinous attack if Americans are given all the information. And all the information includes the fact that Orlando Pulse had a ban on guns, period. t was actually an illustration of the failure of gun bans, rather than justification for implementing them.  It was actually an illustration of the failure of gun bans, rather than justification for implementing them. Consider so many of the other horrific criminal   terrorist attacks that gun control proponents use in hopes of pushing their agenda: the Virginia Tech University (April 16, 2007) the Aurora movie theater (July 20, 2012) Sandy Hook Elementary (December 14, 2012) the DC Navy Yard (September 16, 2013) Fort Hood (April 2, 2014) Umpqua Community College (October 1, 2015) San Bernardino (December 2, 2015) UCLA   (June 1, 2016) and Orlando Pulse (June 12, 2016) to name a few. And what do all of these horrific events have in common? The common thread in all is that they occurred in   zones. But as it turns out,   zones do not #DisarmHate. Instead, they actually give vent to it.   zones give hate a place it can be unleashed because the attacker does not have to worry about facing an armed response. Regardless of these facts, Moms Demand Action has spent the day tweeting and retweeting people who have used the hashtag #DisarmHate or who are attending #DisarmHate marches and rallies. Their tweet of 13 attendees at a Washington state rally exemplifies what they are tweeting: Seattle and Tacoma @MomsDemand represent at Seattle Pride! #DisarmHate pic. twitter.      NW Mama (@PhdTeresa) June 11, 2017,  The cold hard truth is that the people in Orlando Pulse were disarmed, so they had no way to fight back. Following the horrific Orlando Pulse attack, Gwendolyn Patton, spokesperson for the LGBT gun rights group Pink Pistols, warned people not to be fooled into blaming guns for the attack. Patton stressed: Let us not reach for the   fruit of blaming the killers guns. Let us stay focused on the fact that someone hated gay people so much they were ready to kill or injure so many. A human being did this. The human beings tools are unimportant when compared to the bleakness of that persons soul. Patton also pointed out that one of the viable responses to the attack is to keep a gun close for   not to disarm. In fact, less than a month before the attack on   Orlando Pulse, the Pink Pistols announced, We teach queers to shoot. Then we teach others that we have done so. Armed queers dont get bashed.

Alan Dershowtiz: Report He Will Help Defense in Female Genital Mutilation Case Fake News by New York Times,Breitbart,Michael Patrick Leahy,6/12/2017,"Famed attorney and retired Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz told Breitbart News a New York Times story published on Saturday that he has been hired to help the defense in the Michigan female genital mutilation case is misleading and another example of fake news by The New York Times. [On Saturday, the Times reported, Recently, the    an organization overseeing smaller Shiite Muslim sects, hired two   lawyers, Alan Dershowitz and Mayer Morganroth, to help the defense, The Associated Press reported.   Misleading, Dershowitz said of the Times report. Ive written a letter to The Times correcting its story, Dershowitz told Breitbart News. Another example of fake news by The New York Times. I hope theyll print my letter, but you never know, Dershowitz told Breitbart News in a phone interview from Vienna, Austria on Monday morning. So heres the story. This group rejects female genital mutilation. I agreed to consult with them and to work toward an acceptance of merely a symbolic pin prick, not even of the clitoris, but just of the clitoral hood, which is the equivalent of the foreskin, Dershowitz said of his consulting agreement with the    the governing body that oversees members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect of Islam. He went on to say: The idea really is the functional equivalent of what Jews do. If a   kid were circumcised at birth, as many are, but didnt have a bris, didnt have a religious circumcision, and he wants to convert to Judaism, or his parents want to convert him to Judaism, he has a little symbolic pin prick,  it draws one tiny bit of blood, and that takes the place of a circumcision, and thats what Ive proposed&gt, World wide, there are about one million members of the Dawoodi Bohra sect, which is based in Mumbai, India. Muffaddal Saifuddin is the current spiritual leader. The sect has at least six mosques in the United States, located in Michigan, Houston, Chicago, New Jersey, Washington, D. C. and Fremont, California. While it is not known exactly how many adherents of the sect currently reside in the United States, at least three of them have run afoul of the law recently in Michigan. Dr. Fakhruddin Attar was arrested in the Detroit suburb of Livonia, Michigan Friday, accused, along with his wife Farida Attar, of involvement in the same female genital mutilation conspiracy that led to the landmark arrest last week of Dr. Jumana Nagarwala, Breitbart News reported in April. All three defendants are part of a small   community known as the Dawoodi Bohra, which was at the center of an Australian   prosecution that sent three people to prison in 2015, the Detroit Free Press reported: In the wake of the case, an organization that oversees the Dawoodi Bohra community in Detroit has defended the group, stating: The Dawoodi Bohras do not support the violation of any U. S. law, local, state or federal. We offer our assistance to the investigating authorities. Any violation of U. S. law is counter to instructions to our community members. It does not reflect the everyday lives of the Dawoodi Bohras in America.        We take our religion seriously but our culture is modern and  .  Dershowitz again stated that The New York Times got the story wrong and that he is not helping the defense of the individuals charged with committing the federal crime of female genital mutilation in Michigan: Im consulting   The Times mischaracterized my role   Im not representing any of the people who are charged. Im just consulting with the group in an effort to try to create a world wide alternative to female genital mutilation. If we can get everybody in the world who today practices female genital mutilation, this group does not, every group in the world who practices it, if we can get them all to substitute the symbolic pin prick, which is the equivalent, for example of a 15 year old kid having your ear pierced, which is legal, it causes just about the same amount of harm to have your ears piereced as to have  a tiny prick on the labial hood, that to me would be a great accomplishment. It would also help resolve the conflict between religious freedom and the interests of the state in preventing child harm. So thats my role in the case, as a consultant to try and move the world away from female genital mutilation toward a much more benign sterilized pin prick. They dont practice FGM, lets be clear about that, Dershowitz said of the group    adding: My goal is to help create a model all over the world for groups that do practice, to be able to comply with the law. What I want to do is get the U. S. government to agree that a sterilized benign symbolic pin prick would not violate the law. I think that if we can do that we would have accomplished a great deal. Breitbart News asked Professor Dershowitz if this is just a false flag to create the impression there is widespread use of the symbolic pin prick as an alternative to female genital mutilation when in fact the traditional barbaric practice of female genital mutilation will continue as before. Im not concerned about this group, Dershowtiz said. He went on: This group wants to obey the law, and has been trying to obey the law. They will do everything in their power to obey. This group never practiced clitoral cutting  or anything of the kind, so I am very comfortable representing this group and trying to get the law to change, or really to get the law to recognize our position, which is the law doesnt apply to the pin pricking. If we can get the U. S. government to accept that, we think were going to improve both the situation facing young girls today and the freedom of the religion of the group. So for me this presents the possibility of a   a win for the first amendment and a win for young girls who would no longer be exposed to anything beyond the symbolic pin prick. I want to emphasize the pin prick is literally no different than ear piercing and in virtually every state in the union today, parents have the right to have their 10 year old, 8 year old, 6 year old have their ears pierced. Theres no medical good that comes from that, but theres also no medical harm. If you can do it for cosmetic purposes you can certainly be able to do it for religious purposes. Dershowitz told Breitbart News he first became interested in the issue of female genital mutilation when he got a call from this group. I had read a few things about it. I had read works by Richard Schwader, who is a liberal anthropologist, and who has been pushing very hard for this pin prick approach. I was influenced by his advocacy as well. I met with him and met with the group and came away believing this would be the best overall solution, he said. Dershowitz also said he has no idea how prevalent the pin prick procedure he advocates as an alternative to female genital mutilation is in those countries where female genital mutilation is a documented health problem for women. I would never ever ever under any circumstances defend the practice of female genital mutilation and I want to state that on the record. I would never ever ever under any circumstances defend or support the practice of female genital mutilation. Im not doing that here, he added. The New York Times was not the only media outlet to get Dershowitzs consulting relationship with    wrong. Famed constitutional law scholar and attorney Alan Dershowitz has joined the defense team in the nations first female genital mutilation case in federal court, The Detroit Free Press reported on June 1."
Dem Rep Jeffries: Every Racist in America Voted for Donald Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Hanchett,6/12/2017,"During a speech on the House floor on Monday, Representative Hakeem Jeffries ( ) argued that while not all Trump voters are racists, every racist in America voted for Donald Trump.   Jeffries said, Since January 20th, weve seen a disturbing increase here in America in         and   acts. And the question is, is this just a coincidence, or could it possibly have something to do with the election of the 45th president of the United States of America? Now, in part, what were seeing is connected to a historic backlash that has often occurred throughout this journey that weve been on here in America, that whenever we make significant progress, theres always a backlash amongst some in America whove got a problem with the fact that weve done things designed to be more consistent with our values of liberty and justice for all, equal protection under the law.  After listing historical examples of this, Jeffries stated,  And then, of course, weve got Barack Obama, who was elected in what many of us viewed as an incredible step in the right direction,   having gone from the outhouse to the White House. Eight years of tremendous progress in moving this country forward, followed by the election of Donald Trump, a man who spent five years perpetrating the racist lie that Barack Obama was not born in the United States of America. And many of us are wondering, why were so many people who worship at the altar of white supremacy drawn to Donald Trumps campaign? What was it about this individual that so many folks dripping in hatred flocked to his candidacy? Thats not to say that every American who voted for Donald Trump is a racist. We do know that every racist in America voted for Donald Trump. thats a problem.  He concluded, And so, again, I just ask the question in closing, is this all a big coincidence? We know part of it is the backlash that has often occurred whenever weve made progress in America, but this president has a responsibility to address the rise in hate crimes that have taken place on his watch, whether or not his election is directly connected to it.

"Gorka: Efforts to Block President Trumps Executive Orders Are Clutching at Straws, Desperation",Breitbart,John Hayward,6/12/2017,"Dr. Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, formerly National Security editor for Breitbart News, spoke with Breitbart News Daily on Monday about the upcoming Supreme Court battle over President Trumps proposal for a temporary travel ban. [U. S. Code, U. S. law, is absolutely explicit. 8 U. S. Code 1182 says it is the presidents decision if there is a national security need, to limit, to vet, to even stop the immigration of individuals from certain countries, Gorka pointed out.  We inherited     this is the irony     from the Obama administration a list of nations that were of greatest concern, where there is the caliphate, where there is terrorism. We used that analysis to issue two executive orders, and they have been attacked for overt political reasons, he said. There was an attempt made to make these seem as if there was some underhand ulterior motive to do with Islam itself, or to do with a certain racial group, when, of course, that cannot be true     because if there were any dread motives, then the fact that the largest Muslim nation, Indonesia, the largest Arab nation, Egypt, are on neither of the executive orders proves the point that this is purely about national security, he contended. Gorka reported that the latest update on the case is that the Department of Justice has requested to the Supreme Court that they hear this case, this attempt to block our executive order, as soon as possible.  Hopefully, that will be the case, Raheem, he told SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam. Kassam mentioned the novel legal theory deployed against the executive order that Trumps rhetoric on the campaign trail a year ago invalidates his exercise of presidential authority by revealing dark motives at odds with the White House justification for the travel ban. Its a pattern that weve been witnessing now for twenty weeks. Its very strange, Gorka said of this reasoning. I was on CNN for my sins last week and I had to discuss for 16 minutes with the host one tweet by the president, as if a tweet is a policy statement or an executive order, he recalled. I think its just clutching at straws. I think its desperation. The campaign trail is not U. S. policy, so I think its desperation on their behalf, and thats why I think we will succeed.  Kassam asked if there was any truth to rumors that President Trump would cancel or delay his upcoming state visit to the United Kingdom following a disastrous election for Prime Minister Theresa May. I really have to use this opportunity, Raheem, to bolster the Breitbart is the factual purveyor reality, Gorka replied. Lets go to the horses mouth: the prime ministers office gave a public statement. The queen, Queen Elizabeth, has issued an invitation to the President of the United States. Nothing has changed since that invitation was sent to the White House. Those are the facts of the matter.  Kassam described it as the latest false   story to generate headlines for a few days, only to be quietly corrected later when the leakers turn out to be wrong. How is it that they get away with this stuff when if we made one tiny little spelling error or typographical error on Breitbart News, I dont hear the bleeding end of it? he asked. I dont even think the moniker fake news is sufficient at the moment. I think we really have to talk about propaganda, Gorka observed in response. But your point is well taken. The lack of consequences for the left in their media has led to the reality where most voters simply dont care. Look at viewing figures for CNN. Look at how the finances of newspapers like the Washington Post     they have to be saved by billionaires because theyre simply not viable in the private market.   Yes, there are double standards, but eventually, at the end of the day, whos listening to them? Just that echo chamber that Ben Rhodes was so proud of creating, he said, referring to President Barack Obamas deputy national security adviser, who has boasted of his ability to manipulate the media. Gorka said the White House planned to spend the coming days talking about economic growth and some big foreign policy stories, such as the diplomatic crisis surrounding Qatar. Just look at the stock market, look at the U. S. economy. Finally, people are being unfettered, small businesses are being allowed to function in ways that actually make them money and not the government, he said. On the national security front, the Qatar situation is fascinating, he observed. The president goes to the heart of the Muslim world. He asks for action. Action is taken, and now we have to see the sponsorship of terrorism end. Thats a big one for me, Raheem.  Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m.

Donald Trump Jr. appears to corroborate Comeys version of the Oval Office meeting with Trump,Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/12/2017,"Donald Trump Jr. appeared to confirm on Saturday that his father   indeed suggested that former FBI Director James Comey should   shut down the FBIs investigation of former National   Security Adviser Michael Flynn.     In an interview on Fox News, Trump Jr. said President Donald   Trump was vindicated by Comeys admission that when he   left the FBI, the bureau wasnt specifically investigating the   president in the probe into potential collusion between the Trump   campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.     But the presidents son also appeared to corroborate Comeys   depiction of an Oval Office meeting in which Trump asked the     to call off the investigation into Flynns   links to Russia and Turkey, an interaction Comey noted in a   personal memo.     You and I both know my father a long time, Trump Jr. told Fox   News Jeanine Pirro. When he tells you to do something, guess   what? Theres no ambiguity in it.     Theres no     Hey, Im hoping     You and I are friends. Hey I   hope this happens, but youve got to do your job.  Thats what he   told Comey. And for this guy, as a politician, to then go   back and write a memo: Oh, I felt threatened.  He felt so   threatened     but he didnt do anything.     Trump Jr. s comments appeared to contradict his fathers   assertions about the incident. The  denied that Trump   asked Comey to drop the Flynn investigation.      In a  Trump   suggested that Comey lied under oath when he told the Senate   Intelligence Committee about Trumps Flynn request.     I didnt say that, Trump . And thered be nothing wrong with   it if I did say that, according to everybody that I read today,   but I did not say that.   Comey explained his concern about   his meetings with the president, saying he did not feel   comfortable being in a room alone with Trump, as he felt the   president was attempting to seek personal loyalty from the FBI   director, despite the departments duty to remain neutral.     The former FBI director said he publicly   disclosed memos about his meeting with Trump because he felt   the White House may deceive the public about the nature of the   meetings and Comeys firing.     First, I was alone with the . ..  Comey said of   why he took notes. The subject matter: I was talking about   matters that touch on the FBIs core responsibility and that   relate to the president,   personally. And then   the nature of the person: I was honestly concerned that he might   lie about the nature of our meeting, so I thought it important to   document.     tttEarlier I sat down with .

"Democrat Sherrod Brown Under Fire for Inaccurate Claim that Breitbart, Bannon, Gorka Anti-Semitic - Breitbart",Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,6/12/2017,"Democratic U. S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio finds himself in serious political trouble after he inaccurately accused Breitbart News Network and chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon of being   last week. Bannon is the former executive chairman of Breitbart News. [Last Tuesday, Brown appeared at a Zionist Organization of America (ZOA) event in Washington, D. C. and bashed President Donald Trumps White House and Breitbart News Network. He spoke after Dr. Sebastian Gorka, a former Breitbart News national security editor who is now a senior White House aide. Now, Brown is under fire as both the head of ZOA and the Republican candidate for U. S. Senate in Ohio in 2018   Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel   are calling him out publicly as he continues to refuse to apologize and correct his inaccurate statements.  I listened to the words of Mr. Gorka, Im not going to engage in a political debate but a conversation I had with the Prime Minister of Israel in a small group   a bipartisan group   about a month ago, I told the Prime Minister I know youre happy with this new president standing up on Israel. I know youre happy with his support on QME [Qualitative Military Edge]. I know youre happy with his support on sanctions legislation as I am but, I said, there are a whole lot of members of the Senate in both parties and a whole lot of people in my state that are very concerned about the bigotry and the   in the White House, Brown said when he took the stage at ZOA. And I see, I know that doesnt necessarily play well with this group but you invited me to speak my mind. I know that the beginning of Donald Trumps career in politics was continuing to insist that year after year after year on something that I know the Jewish tradition found abhorrent and that is that this president of the United States [Barack Obama] wasnt born here. I know that Mr. Gorka mentioned Stephen Bannon   I even saw some people cheer when he mentioned Stephen Bannon   I think we know the history of Breitbart.  The audience at ZOA   the oldest   advocacy group in the United States   began loudly booing Browns comments, and Brown thought the audience might have been booing Bannon. Im not sure if those cheers are for Bannon or cheers are for me, they may be more for Bannon and Im okay with that, Brown said. But I also know that   I also know   I also know I could come in here and say what I believe about Israel and you would like that and I will always stand strong on Israel. But I also feel its my duty to speak out when I see what is more and more common in this country, whether its issues of race, issues of religion that frankly bother me. I grew up in a Lutheran family where my faith is important to me. I also grew up having a number of   a good bit of exposure to the Jewish faith. I know the history of Judaism. I know the history of the belief and fight for social justice that your faith teaches better than perhaps any of us are exposed to. I am very, very appreciative of that. I am very worried about this presidents attitudes towards people who are a little bit different and thats why I say that.  Almost immediately, ZOA denounced Brown for making the inaccurate insinuation that Breitbart News, Bannon and Trump are somehow  . ZOA external adviser Arthur Schwartz told Axios Jonathan Swan that the comments were unacceptable. We were deeply disappointed by Senator Browns attacks on President Trump, Steve Bannon, Sebastian Gorka and others that serve in this White House, Schwartz said. We work closely with Mr. Bannon and Dr. Gorka they are true friends of the Jewish state of Israel. The same cannot be said of Senator Brown, a supporter of the catastrophic Iran Deal.  This weekend on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 on Sunday evening, Breitbart News offered Sen. Brown the opportunity to appear on the radio program for an hourlong special on these comments   and the ability to retract the inaccurate comments and apologize. Brown did not make an appearance on the show. Instead, ZOA president Mort Klein and others including Browns GOP opponent in next years Ohio U. S. Senate race did appear to denounce Brown further. This was the Zionist Organization of America, ZOA, mission to Washington lobbying for strong U. S.  relations, Klein told Breitbart News Sunday. Thats why we were there. That was the focus. Thats all we wanted to talk about. In fact, when I was sitting with him at the table before he went up, I said Sen. Brown this is a great opportunity to let our people   hundreds of people from all over the country   know that Democrats are also  . Too many people think its only Republicans. Even though the Democrats are not as strong for Israel, there are many good Democrats who are good on Israel. I said this is the time to let people know you are a strong supporter and you are a Democrat. I told him that and yet all he did when he came up was when he got up to speak was attack Donald Trump, attack the administration as filled with bigots and   and attack Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon, Breitbart has never had a   or racist or David Duke type article ever. Ive never seen it. The articles I see are articles fighting   and articles telling the truth about the   war against Israel and promoting Israel. But Ill tell you where this phony image comes from, when Steve Bannon said that Breitbart is a platform for the  Steve Bannon meant a platform for those who are     mainstream people. Too many people thought wrongly [when he said that] that   meant   and David Dukes. Frankly, Ive urged him to make it clear that he never meant that and thats where this distortion of meaning about Steve Bannon came. But whats shocking to me is that even if this were true, we were there about Israel and not there about Donald Trump or Steve Bannon. So it showed to me the intense enmity that Sherrod Brown and many Democrats have toward the Trump administration   a really irrational enmity that makes no sense. In fact, Breitbart   as you mentioned   hired an Orthodox Jew to be head of its Jerusalem station in Israel and he has hired two other Orthodox Jews to work with you over the years. Joel Pollak is still working with you, who is an Orthodox Jew.   rarely hire Orthodox Jews.  LISTEN TO MORT KLEIN OF ZOA ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY: Klein said that Brown furthering inaccurate accusations against Breitbart News, Bannon, Gorka and the Trump White House hurts efforts to hold real   accountable. It makes charges about others that are   not as believable, if people see that these charges against people who are the opposite    Klein said. In fact, the ADL   after attacking Steve Bannon   the   League, and after I defended Steve Bannon saying this is absurd and he is     they came out and said the truth is we do not know of anything he has written or said that is  . So they actually told the truth ultimately, but never said anything again. Its really painful to see this extraordinary lie continue, and theyve done the same with Sebastian Gorka, calling him a   and  . I know both Steve Bannon and Sebastian Gorka. Ive met with them at the White House. I havent met more   two people who are more supportive of Jewish people and Israel than those two guys. And if they were in any way shape or form hostile to Israel or hostile to Jews, I would be all over them. I am a child of Holocaust survivors, the head of the oldest   group. I would be all over them.  Klein wrapped the interview discussing President Trumps recent trip to Israel where he became the first sitting U. S. President to visit the Western Wall. He said the trip was a great success and called on the administration to follow through on moving the U. S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem. He also praised Breitbart News as a positive force in the media, saying this outlet is one of the media beacons of the world, and that Im so grateful for you.  Ohio State Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican candidate for U. S. Senate against Brown in next years midterm U. S. Senate elections, appeared on Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot on Sunday evening as well. Mandel nearly defeated Brown in the 2012 U. S. Senate race, coming up just short of victory as now former President Barack Obama carried the state of Ohio and dragged Brown back into the Senate on his coattails. Now, a different story is brewing in Ohio after Trumps landslide victory in 2016 in the Buckeye State as Mandel makes a second run at Brown in 2018. The rematch between Brown and Mandel is expected to be one of the   Senate races in the 2018 midterms and offers Republicans one of many national opportunities for pickups in the upper chamber of Congress. In his appearance on Breitbart News Sunday, Mandel lambasted Brown for his inaccurate attacks on Bannon, Gorka and Breitbart. I think hes trying to pander to his   base, Mandel said of Browns inaccurate comments. This guy has voted with Elizabeth Warren 97 percent of the time and this is not Ohio. The fact that he is falsely accusing Steve, and falsely accusing Breitbart, of this is in my mind grotesque and also he lacks courage because he wont even come on to talk about it. He can say it behind a microphone but when he is invited on a show like this to actually discuss it my guess is he didnt have the time to come on. Its pure politics. Id rather him sticking up for the people of the state of Ohio. Rather than doing whats right by the people in our state, hes just playing politics and trying to pander to his   base. Like I said, he has voted with Elizabeth Warren 97 percent of the time so part of his base is out there in Massachusetts and East Coast coastal elites and part of his base is on the West Coast in California where theres coastal elites as well.  LISTEN TO JOSH MANDEL ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY: Mandel wonders how Brown can claim he supports Israel when he backed the Iran deal from the previous administration. Exactly, Mandel replied when Breitbart News raised the question about how Brown could say he supports Israel after backing a deal that saw pallets of cash get dropped off in Iran but didnt end the Islamic Republics nuclear program. And how is it  ? Iran is funding terrorism in different parts of the globe and its a radical Islamic regime there in Iran and I believe it threatens people here in the United States and   people in other parts of the globe. You know, its interesting how he as ranking member of the Banking Committee he voted and opposed Iran sanctions. As you mentioned, he was one of the people who supported the presidents Iran deal where they transferred American money   the money of hardworking citizens throughout Ohio and the country, paid to our government   transferred it over to this radical Islamic regime in the Middle East.  Mandel pointed to the protests around America this weekend against Sharia law, and said that if Brown wants to fight bigotry   as he says he does   then he should be standing up against these components of Sharia law not against people who are serving our country at the highest levels in the land, not against journalists like yourself who are trying to hold public officials accountable. It just rings intellectually hollow and it doesnt make much sense, but, again, knowing him     as we do here in Ohio     hes just pandering to his liberal base on the coastal elites.  Cuyahoga County, Ohio, GOP chairman Rob Frost also appeared on the program to call out Brown for his inaccurate attack on Bannon and Breitbart. LISTEN TO ROBERT FROST ON BREITBART NEWS SUNDAY:"
Politico: Democrats Complain DHS John Kelly Is Not Following Their Commands,Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/12/2017,"Democratic Senators think homeland security chief John Kelly is not doing enough to implement their Democratic priorities, according to a litany of partisan complaints showcased by Politico. [The Democratic priorities for Kelly include him ending the enforcement of immigration laws which keep Americans wages from disappearing in a flood of cheap labor and cheap drugs, him publicly backstabbing other leaders in President Donald Trumps cabinet, and him sabotaging Trumps   promise to build a border wall.   I would like to think he would be a moderating force        He has an understanding of why people want to come to this country, so I would think, hopefully, that would be part of his thinking, a disappointed Nevada Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto grumbled to Politico. Look, weve had some arguments, the secretary and I, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey told Politico. I want to try to do whatever I can to work with him, but I think we probably have some basic differences.  Instead of complying with the Democrats priorities, Kelly is building Trumps border wall, and is complying with Trumps Hire American priorities by declining to increase the annual inflow of roughly one million contract workers into the United States. I know we already have large numbers [of contract workers] that come in and have been coming in over the years, but        in the current administration, this is all about American jobs versus people that come in and do the work, Kelly told Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp at a June 6 hearing.  Kelly and Trump have made a few compromises with Democrats     but they have been gotten nothing in exchange except more Democratic hostility and growing worries among their   supporters.  For example, Trump has reversed a campaign promise to shutter the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals   that now allows roughly 765, 000 illegals to work in the United States. We are not, not, not targeting DACA registrants right now, Kelly said June 7 at a hearing called by the House Committee on Homeland Security.  But neither Trump nor Kelly have got anything from the Democrats in exchange for this gift     no cash for the border wall, no promise to curb sanctuary cities, no commitment to reduce companies use of foreign contract workers, and no curbs on company hiring of illegals. Kelly does show his impatience with grandstanding by the legislators who try to make him do the unpopular things that they dare not do     such as importing more contract workers or turning a blind eye to more illegal immigration. One June 7, for example, at a hearing of the House Committee on Homeland Security, he told one legislator who complained about DACA program that: My [response] back to them is If you feel so strongly about it, you clearly do, why dont you do something about it? Why dont you work with your colleagues, both sides of the aisle, because there is a lot of support for this and change the law and Ill follow the law. According to Politicos account of the Democratic complaints: Today, its tough to find anyone on the left willing to defend Kelly. He has alienated potential allies on Capitol Hill, including Democrats who voted to confirm him, and is endangering his reputation as a nonpartisan figure in a presidential administration that has relatively few. I think Secretary Kelly has drank the  said Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey, who was among the Democrats who voted to confirm Kelly in January. Hes not the person who I thought I was voting for.         The secretary has said that if Democrats dont like his enforcement of immigration laws, they should change those laws or shut up.  That bluntness has further infuriated Democrats, who note they have been trying for years to reform immigration laws but have been stymied by Republicans. Kelly owes his job to the fact that Trump ran against the Democrats very unpopular   reform of immigration laws that would have transferred even more money away from Americans pay packets over to Wall Street, according to Congress own budget office. He now looks secure in his job, but Senator Menendez is facing a criminal case that may end his tenure in the Senate this winter, long before Kelly packs his retirement bags.  So Kelly does his job amid growing Democratic complaints. I have my marching orders from the president, he told the House Committee on Homeland Security on June 7."
Delta pulled its sponsorship of a Shakespeare play that showed a Trump-like figure getting stabbed,Business Insider,Mark Abadi,6/12/2017,"Delta Air Lines pulled its sponsorship from New York Citys   Public Theater on Sunday because one of its   plays depicts the assassination of a politician who looks   like President Donald Trump.     The theater companys production of Shakespeares Julius Caesar   features actors wearing modern dress and a blond, business     title character. The character is stabbed to death   in a bloody scene midway through the play.     No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging   of Julius Caesar at this summers Free Shakespeare in the Park   does not reflect Delta Air Lines values, Delta said in a   . Their   artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards   of good taste.     The play is running through June 18 as part of the Public   Theaters popular Shakespeare in the Park series in Manhattans   Central Park.     Hosts of the Fox News morning program Fox and Friends   criticized the play earlier Sunday.      A disgusting New York City play depicting the president brutally   assassinated, all while being funded by your taxpayer dollars, a   Fox host said as she introduced a segment about the play.     Donald Trump Jr. chimed in as well, tweeting a Fox News   article about the segment and asking Serious question, when does   art become political speech & does that change things?     Before pulling its sponsorship, Delta responded to the Fox News   tweet with the statement, We do not support this interpretation   of Julius Caesar.     A note on the plays website, from director Oskar Eustis,   addresses the provocative scene.     Julius Caesar is about how fragile democracy is. The   institutions that we have inherited from the struggle of many   generations of our ancestors, can be swept away in no time at   all, it reads, in part.     The difficulty in determining the protagonist of Julius Caesar       there are at least four credible candidates     is not a formal   weakness of the play, but rather essential to its structure. When   history is happening, when the ground is slipping away from under   us and all that is solid melts into air, leadership is as   transitory and flawed as the times.  Delta Air Lines pulled its sponsorship from New. .."
Trump Supporters Plan Protest at CNN Headquarters in Atlanta to Decry Fake News - Breitbart,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/12/2017,"Debbie Dooley of Main Street Patriots is hoping hundreds will gather at the headquarters of CNN in Atlanta on Saturday to protest what its members consider fake news being produced by the giant media corporation. [Specifically, Dooley told Breitbart News that they object to the fake news being put out about President Donald Trump.  Were encouraging people to come out and support our president, said Dooley, one of 22 national   of the Tea Party and   of Main Street Patriots. And to condemn the extreme biased coverage at CNN.  Dooley said she hopes the crowd is large enough to surround the building. So far, people from Georgia and neighboring states have signed on to participate, including one man from Pakistan who told Dooley he was having a fake news   made for the protest. Dooley said: CNN threw objective journalism out the window once Donald Trump was elected President and have begun to report DNC talking points as news. CNN can no longer claim to be a news organization that reports facts without bias, because they report innuendo with no facts as news with the intent on bringing down a   President. They have simply become an entertainment network not to be taken seriously. Time for Trump supporters to get active and show the Democrats that we are very passionate about our support of President Trump and we will fight hard to pass his agenda, the notice of the event states on Main Street Patriots website. Bring your signs and lets show CNN that we support President Trump and call them out for becoming an arm of the DNC intent on bringing down President Trump with biased coverage and false innuendos, the invitation on Main Street Patriots Facebook page states. Main Street Patriots was   by Ralph King, a Tea Party activist who served as a Trump delegate from Ohio, served as a Presidential Elector from Ohio in the Electoral College, and is the national   of Tea Party for Trump. The protest will take place from 11 a. m. to 12:30 p. m. Saturday at CNN, located at 190 Marietta St. NW, Atlanta, Georgia."

Inside Venezuela: The Socialist Haven on the Brink of Total Collapse - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/12/2017,"CARACAS, Venezuela     Even at Bogot airport in Colombia, the closest major capital city to Venezuela, a look of curiosity comes over the faces of staff when you tell them you are heading to Caracas. [Entry visas into Venezuela remain fairly accessible, although journalists are not allowed without a special visa. Although I claimed I was there as a tourist, this seemed   even to the likely   immigration authorities. What is the real motive of your visit? the officer asked me. Seeing my girlfriend, I replied.  She smiled. Welcome to Venezuela.  As you travel down from Simon Bolvar International Airport into the city center, the difference between Caracas and Bogot     formerly one of the worlds major drug war battlegrounds     is stark. Armed police stand on almost every street corner. Every physical space is dedicated to promoting the success of the late Hugo Chvezs socialist revolution and Nicols Maduros authoritarian regime. The opposition undermines official government propaganda with its own graffiti, effectively accusing the regime of destroying the country with the highest oil reserves in the world. The rise in   messaging stands out compared to my visit last November.   propaganda shares the streets with graffiti denouncing the regime on nearly every block.  This is the new Bolivarian toilet paper     a reference to Maduros proposed changes to the Venezuelan constitution, rejected by the people in a vote last year. Maduro is depicted holding a pocket constitution.  If hunger kills the people, the people will take out the government.  A billboard calls for the release of opposition Leopoldo Lpez, who was imprisoned by the regime in 2014 for organizing a peaceful assembly against Maduro. Nearly every day,   marches take place across Venezuela, nearly all of which attract violence. So far, as many as 84 protesters have been killed since daily protests began in late March, as police use water cannons, rubber bullets, and smoke bombs to control the situation. Protests have the feel of an    soccer crowd. There is a feeling of solidarity among people, most of whom are wearing Venezuelan flags. On the side of the street, salesmen sell what can only be described as protest merchandise, including Venezuelan flags, horns, and  . Below, the shirts read from left to right: S. O. S. Venezuela Whosoever Tires Will Lose Resistance: Dont Surrender! Closer to police and military barriers, the protests become more tense, with the menace of violence constantly present. Many of those protesting are boys and young men in their  .  This is a fight for our families, for our future, a group of masked protesters tell me. We will risk our lives every day for as long as it takes to bring down this dictatorship.  A group of young protesters pump themselves up as they prepare to face off with police. On a visit to the Universidad Central de Venezuela, the countrys biggest university, something seemed not quite right. The university itself seems like any other, with department buildings scattered around a campus, as well as grandiose facilities such as sports stadiums and a stunning concert hall. Yet, despite it being a Wednesday, there are barely any students around. The situation is too serious right now for students to dedicate sufficient time to studying, English professor Lilliana Cspedes tells me. Many prioritize attending   marches or trying to earn money to support their families. During some of my classes, just a handful of students turn up.  One of the most frustrating things about trying to understand Venezuela is the high level of security at places the regime would like to hide. As I enter a   supermarket, security guards check my pockets to see what I am carrying. They find my camera. No photos here, they say. A similar routine takes place on the way out. I also tried my luck at a Venezuelan state hospital, although this time armed guards asked me to put the camera away. Nearly every public place in Caracas is guarded by police keeping a watchful eye over the situation. Most are very meagerly paid, but still officially remain supportive of the government.  Sitting in a hospital waiting room, armed guards soon ask me to put away my camera. Failing to comply would likely mean facing arrest. Amid the crisis, some Venezuelans have accused others of not doing enough to fight the Maduro regime. The only way I see out of the current regime is a military coup, my taxi driver, Nelson lvarez, tells me. Some people have accused me of indifference towards the current political situation, but I have a family to look after. No matter how many or how violent the opposition protests, the key to bringing down this government are the military.  Everything about Venezuela suggests this is a nation on the brink of collapse. Whether it is the ongoing violence, the extreme poverty, or the enormous piles of garbage in the street, nothing is working as it should be. In January, inflation reached over 800 percent, while some analysts predicting it could reach 1500 percent by the end of the year. Even at one of the citys most exclusive hotels, breakfast offerings remain scarce and electricity and internet connection regularly cut out.  Thousands of notes are now required to buy anything of value. However, the government recently introduced higher denominations.  Many streets are covered in landfill. People can be regularly seen searching through garbage for scraps.  Im Hungry While some still solely blame the current crisis on the collapse in oil prices in 2012, a vast majority of Venezuelans believe the country needs serious economic reform. After 17 years of hardcore socialism, egged on by   elites around the world, many in leadership appear hesitant to accuse the socialist system itself     and not the people running it     of being the problem. Many within the oppositions leadership structure are members of the Socialist International (SI). Popular Will, the party led by Leopoldo Lpez before his arrest, belongs to the SI. Lpezs colleagues often find it easier to lay the blame at Maduros feet and call for elections, rather than demand a free, capitalist society, rebuilt from the ground up. Yet the students and street protesters, who have put their lives on pause to fight Maduro, seem to understand that the institutional rot goes way beyond Maduro. As one student put it to me: Chvez succeeded in creating an equal society by making everyone poor.  You can follow Ben Kew on Facebook, on Twitter at @ben_kew, or email him at bkew@breitbart. com"
Trump is starting to draw battle lines with Congress on an issue with huge implications for the global economy,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,6/12/2017,"By sometime later this summer, Congress will have to       raise the nations debt ceiling.     The deadline that led to the night President Barack Obama once    of his presidency is once again   on the horizon in Washington.     Raising the debt ceiling: At its core, a seemingly simple   function of Congress. But the battle over raising the   cap on how much debt the federal government can   incur emphasizes divides not only in Congress but also   within President Donald Trumps administration.     Failing to reach a deal to raise the nations borrowing limit,   however, could be disastrous for the global economy and possibly   undermine large swaths of the international financial   system.      I want to emphasize that the sooner they do it, the less   uncertainty there is in the market, Treasury Secretary Steven   Mnuchin said of Congress on Friday.     The timeframe for dealing with the debt ceiling has crept up amid   recent developments.     I respectfully urge Congress to protect the full faith and   credit of the United States by acting to increase the statutory   debt limit as soon as possible, Mnuchin    when a temporary suspension of the limit expired in March.     Since then, the Treasury has used extraordinary measures   to extend the timeframe on the debt ceiling by suspending   some investments in federal retirement funds and slowing the pace   of debt issuance. Originally, the Treasury and Office of   Management and Budget indicated the ceiling would be hit sometime   in the fall, though the exact timing is only a best estimate.     Mnuchin said recently, however, that the pace of tax receipts the   department generated was slower than expected over the past few   months.  ,   Mnuchin told the House Ways and Mean Committee in a hearing   on May 24.     On Friday, however, Mnuchin did seem a bit less alarmed, saying   the Treasury has backup plans if the limit is not raised by   August. He did not specify those plans.          Mick Mulvaney, the director of the Office of Management and   Budget, also said  that the slower pace of tax   collections would mean the debt ceiling could be breached   sooner than previous projections.              tax receipts seem to be in part a problem of   Trumps own making. Trumps promise to cut taxes and recent   rollout of a   tax outline seems to be  of the lower rates.   said tax receipts between October and April were 3%   below the offices projections from January. The CBO said   that could be in part due to Trumps tax promise.     The reason that payments for 2016 activity were smaller than   anticipated may be that income growth was weaker than expected in   calendar year 2016, or that taxpayers shifted more income than   projected from 2016 to later years, expecting legislation to   reduce tax rates to be enacted this year, the CBO report said.   has also reported that wealthier Americans   have been deferring tax payments on   income in order to   take advantage of the lower rates that Trump says are on the way.   an analyst at   the Congressional Research Service, the idea of an official debt   limit stretches back to The Second Liberty Bond Act of 1917.   There has been an aggregate limit on the level of federal debt   since the 1939.     Prior to this Congress, had to approve debt offerings by the   Treasury on an individual basis. The debt ceiling, on the other   hand, allowed Congress to exert some influence over spending   and debt issuance while making it easier for the Treasury to   effectively finance operations. That was especially   important for bond issuances to finance American involvement in   World War I.     Since the debt ceilings inception, it was repeatedly raised with   little fuss     until the 21st century.       fights, especially amid massive deficit   increases following the 2008 financial crisis, have   become more difficult and politically contentious.     Perhaps the most famous came in 2011, when it appeared   that Republican leadership in the House did not have enough votes   from its conference to pass the debt ceiling bill just hours   before it was set to be breached. Obama, in an interview in   January, called the moment the most   of his   presidency and said he had prepared a speech in case the US went   into partial default on its debt.     Obamas fear was warranted, given the massive impact failing to   raise the debt ceiling would have on not only the finances of the   federal government, but also the global economy.     In the most basic sense, if the debt limit is not raised the   government  and many elements of   the federal government .     During previous debt ceiling fights, the major     agencies all said a default would lead to a serious   downgrade of the USs credit rating. In 2011, the   simple fact that the US got so close a breach   led Standard & Poors to downgrade the countrys     rating      of the nation.     Further lowering the credit rating would increase borrowing   costs for the government, make issuing new debt more costly, and   cause serious disruptions in global credit markets.     Outside of the effect on the US governments   financial situation, the loss of faith that the America   would always pay its bills would ripple out into the global   economy.     For instance, even the prospect of a default in 2011 caused a   steep decline in US stock markets. A report on the macroeconomic   effect of the 2011 ceiling fight from  said that the S&P 500 index of   equity prices fell about 17% in the period surrounding the 2011   debt limit debate.        Amadou Sy, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, pointed   out just how important the US maintaining good standing is for   global investors in a post before the 2013 debt ceiling increase.          Since the US dollar is the considered the worlds reserve   currency and US government bonds are key assets in much of   the worlds investment portfolios, undermining the worlds trust   in these financial products could be devastating.    on the economic impact of such a default   concluded that the failure to raise the debt ceiling would be   catastrophic.     From the report:     Given the necessity of raising the ceiling, the argument over the   limit often becomes a battleground for various ideological   arguments and politically motivated riders. This time, it has   split not only Congress, but the Trump administration as well.     Mnuchin, for one, has said he favors a clean raise       legislation solely to raise the ceiling.     On the other hand, Mulvaney has advocated for legislation   that includes some spending cuts designed to rein in some of the   debt increases in the future. Such a move would likely be a   poison pill for Democratic support and make it difficult to pass,   given the thin Republican majority in the Senate.     Trump, for his part, has appeared to take Mnuchins side, telling   congressional Republican leaders that Mnuchin is that guy        Mulvaneys position, however, is supported by his former   colleagues in the hardline conservative House Freedom Caucus       and by some in the House GOP leadership.     The Freedom Caucus, which continually pushes for debt reduction   and curtailed spending, even went as far as taking   an official position in May that it would not support   any debt ceiling bill without concessions on spending cuts.      House Speaker Paul Ryan has also said the party   should target spending reductions to go along with a limit   raise, but did not guarantee they would have the votes to do so.     Yes, that can be achieved, Ryan told reporters at a press   conference Thursday. The question is can we assemble the vote   coalition to do that. So, were not taking any options off the   table, were talking with our members about what is the best way   to proceed, and how can we meet these fiscal deadlines we have.     Hardline deficit hawks in the Senate, like Sen. Rand Paul, also   have  as a part of debt   ceiling legislation.        Democrats have long pushed for a clean raise, and so far that is   their official position.                               By sometime later this summer, Congress will. .."
Jeff Sessions Senate Intel Committee Testimony Will Be Public,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/12/2017,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee will be made in an open hearing. [The announcement came last week that Sessions would follow up   Director James Comeys testimony before the same committee with his own appearance, but it was speculated that appearance would be in a closed session. The Intelligence Committees chairman, Sen. Richard Burr ( ) announced Monday that the attorney generals testimony will be before the public as Comeys was last Thursday.  The subject of the hearing, which will take place Tuesday at 2:30 p. m. Eastern Time in the Hart Senate Office Building, will be the ongoing probe into Russian involvement in the 2016 presidential campaign and the   controversy about Comeys firing from the FBI and subsequently leaks to the press of potentially privileged memos about his conversations with President Donald Trump. Sessions, who recused himself from all involvement in the Department of Justices own Russia investigation, was thrust back into the fracas by Comeys testimony. The fired FBI head strongly implied that the attorney general refused to protect him from or offer advice on how to deal with an overbearing President Trump. He also posited that he was not made aware of the scope and parameters of Sessions recusal. Sessions spokesman categorically denied these claims in a statement Friday, offering an email sent to Comey in March laying out the attorney generals reasons for recusing himself and the extent to which he did so. Among the more striking revelations of Comeys testimony was his admission that he had himself used   friend and Columbia University law professor, Daniel Richman, to leak the now infamous let this go memo on an alleged conversation between himself and the president. Comey further admitted that he did so specifically to force the appointment of a special counsel, a purpose fulfilled when Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who had been heading the investigation, appointed Comeys predecessor and mentor Robert Mueller to that position last month. Also likely on the docket will be Sessions own interactions with members of the Russian government. The attorney generals political opponents have made much of his failure to disclose, during his confirmation hearings and on his security clearance application, certain meetings he had, primarily with Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak, during the 2016 campaign. Despite Sessions insistence that all these meetings were made in the scope of his official duties as a United States senator, voices from the left, such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi ( ) have gone so far as to demand Sessions resign over the matter. Sessions will likely seek to dispel whatever taint Senate Democrats attempt to create over these meetings and clarify the exact chain of events that led to Comeys dismissal, an action he publicly endorsed at the time. Sessions and Comeys testimony in rapid succession before the Senate Intelligence Committee is not the first time the two men will lock political horns. As far back as October, Sessions was expressing his misgivings about Comey. The pairs latest spar will play out before the American public Tuesday afternoon."
The Fruits of Socialism: Venezuela in 20 Photos - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/12/2017,"As Venezuela enters year eighteen of the Bolivarian Socialist Revolution, the international community is finally paying attention, as Venezuelans struggle to find food, medicine, and an outlet for their frustration that will not trigger rampant state violence. [There is no short version of the story of how South Americas wealthiest nation, which boasts the worlds largest known oil reserves, became a nation where 15 percent of people need to scavenge through garbage to eat while the nations dictator dances on state television. Venezuelas decline is the inevitable endgame of socialism, told by the deterioration of its streets, the abuse of its opposition politicians, and the use of the military to maim and kill Venezuelan children as young as 14.  Below, 20 images show the true toll of socialism in Venezuela. December 2011: While the death of Hugo Chvez allowed for socialist leaders to rapidly develop the cult of personality around him as a saint and martyr of socialism, the North   cult worship of Chvez began during his lifetime. In 2011, chavista government officials put together a Christian nativity scene depicting Chvez as the baby Jesus figure, surrounded by founding fathers such as Simn Bolvar. (Lencre Noir)   May 2011: As violent drug and gang activity flourished under Chvez, Venezuelans grew to fear murder at the hands of thugs so much that they prayed to dead thugs to protect them, creating idols known as santos malandros   holy thugs   and offering them small sacrifices in exchange for safety on urban streets.

Homes where Colombian citizens used to live were marked D for demolition, to erase any trace of Colombians there. Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos denounced the move as using Nazi ghetto tactics against a friendly neighboring country.

The other half is one of extreme poverty, where the value of the currency, the bolvar, has been in freefall for years. Even those with money struggle to find a store that is properly stocked. During the Chvez era, finding junk food and unhealthy soda in supermarkets was still possible, but not without encountering   soldiers posted to prevent visitors from photographing the shortages or attempting to buy more than necessary.  During the Maduro era, the government implemented a strict ration card system. (Juan    Images) May 2016: The below image is not an uncommon find in Venezuelan supermarkets.

Woman Wearing Moms Demand Action Button: Murdering President Trump On Stage is Just Theater - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/12/2017,"A woman wearing a Moms Demand Action button on her lapel told Inside Edition that the depiction of President Trump being murdered on stage is just theater and everybody knows its theater.

Pennsylvania Abortion Clinic Shut Down by Health Department,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/12/2017,"A Harrisburg, Pennsylvania abortion clinic has been shut down after the state Department of Health found serious violations affecting the safety and health of patients. [State Secretary of Health Dr. Karen Murphy ordered the Hillcrest Womens Medical Center to suspend its services following a June 5 unannounced inspection found serious deficiencies and violations, said a press release.  Three Pennsylvania state senators responded to the report of Hillcrests violations with questions about why the Department of Health (DOH) has not revoked the abortion clinics license, reports CatholicNewsLive. Hillcrest has violated the states health laws four times in the past six years. State Sens. Joe Scarnati (R) Bob Mensch (R) and John DiSanto (R) wrote to Murphy: The DOH inspection report portrays a facility which is clearly unsafe and unhealthy for both patients and staff alike. Given this, we would like an explanation as to why DOH did not immediately move to suspend or revoke Hillcrest Womens Medical Centers license upon finding such numerous egregious violations. These health and safety violations are obviously deeply troubling. However, even more problematic appears to be DOHs response, which was to allow the abortion clinic to continue operating while granting Hillcrest a six month grace period to correct the cited deficiencies.  During an inspection in February, the abortion clinic was found to have improper staffing     no registered nurse on staff, and failure to show documentation that its physician was a board eligible   the Department of Healths report says. Hillcrest was also found to have failed compliance with the states Child Protective Services Law. The clinic has been treating girls younger than 18 years of age, though at least eight staff members had not had the background checks required for working with children. According to the report, the Department of Health reviewed 12 patient records and found all 12 patients had no nursing care or monitoring while recovering from anesthesia administered during surgical abortion. Murphy said in the departments statement: The health and safety of patients served at any Pennsylvania health care facility is a top priority of the Wolf Administration. On Monday, Department of Health staff conducted an unannounced monitoring visit to Hillcrest Womens Medical Center. The department concluded that it was no longer safe for the facility to continue providing medical services to patients. Therefore, I have ordered the facility to suspend all services until such time that it can demonstrate it is safe for women to receive care. While the June inspection found that a registered nurse was on the premises, additional violations were identified     including expired sterilization and medical supplies     that led to the decision to close the clinic. The Hillcrest Womens Medical Center deserved to be closed down, but the truth is that the March deficiency report was far from the worst we have seen in our research of abortion facilities, says   Operation Rescue president Troy Newman. All abortion facilities that cannot pass health inspections should be closed. We urge every state to conduct unannounced inspections of abortion facilities so they can see the real conditions and practices women face at these abortion dumps on an everyday basis.  Hillcrests violations come after Pennsylvania enacted a law in 2011 requiring abortion clinics to be subject to unannounced inspections. The law was passed following the case of West Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell, who was convicted in 2013 of murdering babies born alive during abortions by cutting their spinal cords. Gosnell, who operated a clinic that became known as the house of horrors because of its filthy conditions, also was found guilty in the death of one of his patients. The abortion industry and its political and media allies continue to fight against states in court that pass health and safety laws that would raise the standard of care in abortion clinics to those of other outpatient treatment facilities. The abortion lobby claims these laws are unfair to women who wish to access the procedure. In its latest investigative report,   organization Americans United for Life (AUL) provides details of hundreds of violations of state laws regulating abortion clinics. The   report, titled Unsafe: The Public Health Crisis in Americas Abortion Clinics Endangers Women, challenges the narrative advanced by abortion advocates that the U. S. Supreme Courts decision in the recent Texas case of Whole Womans Health vs. Hellerstedt prevents state legislatures from requiring health and safety standards in abortion clinics."
Trump decision on Afghanistan still weeks away,CNN,Jeremy Diamond,6/12/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump is not expected to make a decision on the US strategy in Afghanistan for several more weeks, a senior administration official told CNN. Trumps national security team was expected to present him with recommendations on the path forward in Afghanistan    including adding several thousand more troops    in early May, and a US official told CNN at the time that Trump likely would make a decision upon returning from his first foreign trip. But two weeks since his return, a senior administration official said the fully fleshed out interagency recommendations are now not expected to reach the Presidents desk for another couple weeks. The delay comes amid an uptick in violence in Afghanistan that in just the last two weeks saw 150 people killed in a major terrorist attack in Kabul and three US service members killed during a joint   military operation. The official insisted the review process had not stalled, but acknowledged the administration had expected to be further along in the process. This thing isnt done, the official said, adding that the complexity of the problem and different perspectives from various government agencies have slowed the process. Despite the increase in violence, the senior administration official said the Presidents national security advisers are still preparing to recommend Trump commit no more than 5, 000 additional US troops. US officials are also seeking an increased troop commitment from NATO military partners. The official said Trump will be presented with an ambitious review of the USs policies in South Asia that will go beyond recommendations on the US fight in Afghanistan to include US policy toward neighboring India and Pakistan. Trump has not been briefed on the full strategy, but has been receiving periodic updates, the official said. Trumps top Cabinet officials on national security matters, the National Security Council and the US ambassadors in Afghanistan, Pakistan and India have all been involved in formulating the administrations policy review, the official said. The US faces a slew of complex problems in Afghanistan that go beyond the United States military campaign against the Taliban and   which dates back to 2001. Now, the US is also facing an increasingly aggressive insurgency from ISIS Khorasan, the terror groups Afghanistan affiliate, and is also becoming increasingly wary of Irans deepening influence in the country. There are about 8, 400 US troops in Afghanistan, most of whom are involved in the   mission to train and advise Afghan troops. About 2, 000 US service members are also engaged in a counterterrorism mission in Afghanistan aimed at targeting groups like   and ISIS. The proposal to increase troop levels in Afghanistan, which is supported by Trumps national security adviser Lt. Gen. H. R. McMaster and Defense Secretary James Mattis, continues to face pushback from West Wing officials allied with Steve Bannon, the Presidents chief strategist. On Tuesday evening at a hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Mattis made clear that administration is taking a regional approach: Were looking at everything from the situation between India and Pakistan, Pakistan and Afghanistan, obviously Iran, that whole South Asia area. . .. We are going to have to recognize that problems that come out of ungoverned space like that, . .. those problems do not stay there, they can come home to roost here. Mattis also said that he wanted more support from US allies: Weve got to determine what level of support is necessary, and how we orchestrate the international community, not just the Americans, but the international community to deal with this. Trumps decision to deepen the USs military footprint in Afghanistan would follow President Barack Obamas attempts to draw down that troop presence and would cut against Trumps campaign rhetoric, in which he lamented the USs   involvement in Afghanistan and vowed to put a stop to the USs   policies. The White House is also facing increasing pressure    and frustration    from Congress to make a decision on the future of the US fight in Afghanistan. Elliot Engel, the top Democrat on the House foreign affairs committee, noted after the Kabul bombing late last month that the Trump administration still has no strategy to wind down the conflict in Afghanistan."
Trumps Cabinet ranked by over-the-top praise,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/12/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump held a super weird Cabinet meeting Monday afternoon. In it, he sat silently as each member of his Cabinet lavished praise on him. Seriously. I wrote about the whole thing here. But    with the help of super intern Liz Stark, who graduated college Saturday and was at work Monday morning(!)    I went through the transcript and ranked the Cabinet members by just how obsequious their encomiums to Trump actually were. Before we go any further, an important note: The people on this list are those who required Senate confirmation plus Vice President Mike Pence. So, no White House chief of staff Reince Priebus who deserves honorable mention for this gem: We thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that youve given us to serve your agenda and the American people. To the rankings! 23. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt, I actually arrived back this morning at 1 oclock from Italy and the   summit focused on the environment. And our message there was the United States is going to be focused on growth and protecting the environment. And it was received well. I admire Pruitt slickly getting the whole        thing into a short statement. But, this was WAY short on direct praise for the President. Do better, Pruitt! 22. Defense Secretary James Mattis, Mr. President, its an honor to represent the men and women of the Department of Defense. And we are grateful for the sacrifices our people are making in order to strengthen our military so our diplomats always negotiate from a position of strength. Thank you. A nice sentiment. But nary a word of direct praise for Trumps commitment to the military. 21. Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, In the five months that Ive been at the job, we have gone a long way to facilitate the    improve the legal movement of people and commerce across our borders, yet at the same time, we have gone a long way to safeguarding our borders, particularly the southern border, working with all of our partners to the south. A clear appeal to Trumps ego by citing the gains made across the southern border. But, heavier on policy than praise, to be honest. 20. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, First of all, I apologize for being late to work. I got bogged down in that swamp that youve been trying to drain. I am going to use this excuse the next time I miss a TV hit. (Related: I am on TV and, therefore, a big deal. Many   books.) 19. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Thank you for the honor to serve the country. Its a great privilege youve given me. Great privilege? Good. But not great. 18.

The other countries are gradually getting used to the (inaudible) the free rides are somewhat over with. Theyre not happy with this, but I think (inaudible) growing recognition that (inaudible) have a chance to help you live up to your campaign promises. Live up to campaign promises is music to Trumps ears. 13. Energy Secretary Rick Perry, America is not stepping back, but were stepping into place and sending some messages, that were still going to be leaders in the world when it comes to the climate, but were not going to be held hostage to some executive order that was ill thought out. And so, my hats off to you for taking that stance and presenting a clear message around the world that Americas going to continue to lead in the area of energy. Affirming Trumps decision on the Paris climate accord will endear Perry to Trump. But he missed a real opportunity to say my cowboy hats off to you. 12. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, Mr. President, its been a great honor to    to work with you. Thank you for your strong support of HUD and for all the others around this table that Ive worked with. Reminder: Donald Trump once compared Ben Carsons pathology to a child molester. 11.

Take note, Dr. Carson. 10. Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, Mr. President, thank you for your support and commitment to honoring our responsibility to Americas veterans.

People know what the United States is for, they know what were against, and they see us leading across the board. And so, I think the international community knows were back. Haley isnt always on the Trump message. But she was today! 8. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, It was a great honor traveling with you around the country for the last year and an even greater honor to be here serving on your Cabinet. Not sure if you guys know this but Mnuchin traveled around the country with the President for a whole year. Beat that! 7. CIA Director Mike Pompeo, Mr. President, its an honor to serve as your CIA director. Its an incredible privilege to lead the men and women who are providing intelligence so that we can do the national security mission. And in the finest traditions of the CIA, Im not going to share a d*mn thing in front of the media.  This one had a lot: a) honor to serve b) incredible privilege and c) media bashing! 6.

Attorney General Jeff Sessions, We are receiving, as you know    Im not sure the rest of you fully understand    the support of law enforcement all over America. They have been very frustrated.

The response is fabulous around the country. You dont even KNOW how much people love you, Mr. President. 4. Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney, Thanks for the kind words about the budget. Youre absolutely right: We are going to be able to take care of the people who really need it. And at the same time, with your direction, we were able to also focus on the forgotten man and woman who are the folks who are paying those taxes. Thanks for being absolutely right, Mr. President. And the forgotten man and woman line was just the cherry on the top there, Mick. 3.

Gianforte pleads guilty to assault in incident with reporter,CNN,Kyung Lah,6/12/2017,"(CNN) Greg Gianforte, the Montana   who was accused of body slamming a reporter, pleaded guilty to misdemeanor assault Monday morning. Judge Rick West sentenced Gianforte to a   deferred sentence, 40 hours of community service, 20 hours of anger management and a $300 fine along with a $85 court fee.  West originally sentenced Gianforte to a four days of jail time, to be completed in part through a work program, but switched instead to the hours of community service and anger management as those guilty of assault charges are ineligible for the work program. A misdemeanor assault conviction in Montana carries a maximum penalty of up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500, according to the state government website. Gianforte has apologized to the journalist, Ben Jacobs, and also pledged to donate $50, 000 to the Committee to Protect Journalists, an organization that promotes press freedom, in the hope that perhaps some good can come of these events.  The encounter happened on May 24, when Gianforte was charged with misdemeanor assault after Jacobs accused the politician of body slamming him at a campaign event.  Gianforte, a Republican, won the election the next day and apologized to the reporter during his acceptance speech.  He also issued a letter to Jacobs last week. My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable, and unlawful, Gianforte said in the letter. I made a mistake and humbly ask for your forgiveness. Jacobs accepted the apology. Jacobs was present and made a statement in the courtroom. Gianforte later asked if he could address Jacobs directly and apologized again. I just want to say Im sorry and if and when youre ready, I look forward to sitting down with you in DC, he said. During their encounter at Gianfortes campaign headquarters in Bozeman last month, Jacobs had been asking the   about the Republican health care plan when the assault took place. Gianfortes campaign initially blamed the altercation on Jacobs aggressive behavior and offered a version of events at odds with an audio recording and witness accounts.  In his letter, Gianforte stated: I had no right to respond the way did to your legitimate question about health care policy. You were doing your job. Throughout the proceedings, Rich said he was trying to give Gianforte the same sentence he would give anyone who plead guilty to attacking someone unprovoked."
EXCLUSIVE - Islamic State Supporters Vow Terror Group Will Retake Mosul as Liberators,Breitbart,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,6/11/2017,"Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the   anniversary of the terrorist organizations capture of Mosul, Iraqs   city. [Despite losing most of Mosul to the U. S.  international coalition, the IS supporters vowed that they would return and take control over the entire city once more.  IS completed its takeover of Mosul from Iraqi forces on June 10, 2014. Over the last eight months, the group has been fighting a difficult battle against Iraqi forces supported by an international coalition led by the United States and has lost control of most of the city except for a few pockets of resistance. Nonetheless, the IS members in the chat room marked the   anniversary, with Abi Aisha Almosulawi writing, Thank Allah who blessed us with the blessing of Islam. Thank Allah who granted us the Islamic State that rules through Allahs sharia. The campaign of conquests began here in Mosul and now were dealing with a brutal crusader Shiite war, but we have not surrendered and will not surrender. We will continue to harm the infidels and continue to disturb their peace even if we lose Mosul three years after liberating it. This isnt over. We will continue to trust in Allah and the victory he is expected to grant us one day.  Abi Huzaifa Almosolawi wrote, Today marks three years since the capture of Mosul and its liberation from the hands of the blasphemous Shiites. This glorious conquest that Allah gave his warriors and gave them the opportunity to implement sharia was the beginning of the fulfillment of Allahs promise to the loyal mujahedeen.    We may lose the land but we will never lose the desire to enforce holy sharia on every meter in our control. We will return to Mosul again as liberators and we will liberate Baghdad, Syria, Egypt, Palestine and all the land to impose holy sharia. Even Rome will be liberated and when we enter it we will yell Allah is great, with the help of Allah.  Abi Talha Almagrebi (the Moroccan) wrote, From the pulpit of the mosque in Mosul, the Caliph Abu Bakr (Al Baghdadi) came out and declared the Caliphate. From here, the land of Mosul. From Mosul, we went forth to liberate Fallujah, Al Anbar and other places. Today we come back to the desert but we do so while clinging to the divine promise. We cling to holy sharia and we wont compromise with the infidels. The right and justice lies with us. We will come back here as liberators. When we return as liberators, with the help of Allah, we will remember our mujahedeen brothers Abi Ali Alanbari (a senior military commander in IS who was killed) and the Sheikh Abo Mohamad Aladnani (an IS spokesperson who was killed).  The U.  offensive in Mosul began about eight months ago, with the terrorist group losing most of the city to Iraqi forces except for an area at the western section of the Tigris river. On Saturday, U. S.  Iraqi forces repelled an IS offensive in the Sunni town of Shirqat, just south of Mosul."
Judge Tells Defendant: I Would Have Shot You Dead if You Broke into My House - Breitbart,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/11/2017,"While sentencing Idahoan Logan John Urrizaga to 15 years in prison, Fifth District Judge Randy Stoker said he would have shot Urrizaga dead if he had broken into his house. [Urrizagas sentencing stemmed from September 2016 charges of beating a victim with a baseball bat. KSL reports the sentence will run concurrent to a November burglary charge and will be served in Idahos retained jurisdiction program.   Magic Valley reports that Urrizaga turned away while Judge Stoker was talking and began whispering to his attorney. At that point, Stoker told him to pay attention and said, If you would have broken into my home in the middle of the night, youd be dead. I would have shot you.  After being sentenced, Urrizaga asked to have a few days before turning himself in so that he could spend those days with his fiance and    son. He also asked if he could give his fiance and son a hug. Stoker denied both requests and said, I understand that you have some stability in the community, but Im taking you out of the community. You are going into the rider program because you need to understand the inner workings of the Idaho State Penitentiary.  Cassia County chief deputy prosecutor McCord Larsen said Urrizaga wrote a wonderful apology letter to his beating victim, but Larsen claimed that Urrizaga followed that letter with social media posts belittling the victim.

Collins: Trump should give a yes or no on tapes,CNN,Eli Watkins,6/11/2017,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Susan Collins said Sunday on CNNs State of the Union that she does not understand why President Donald Trump has refused to give a straight yes or no answer to questions about whether he secretly recorded his discussions with FBI Director James Comey. The Maine Republican added that if any audio recordings do exist, she expected Trump to provide them to federal investigators looking into Russias efforts to influence the 2016 election, saying if he did not, he should be legally compelled to do so. He should give a straight yes or no, Collins told anchor Brianna Keilar. And he should voluntarily turn them over. . .. I dont understand why the President just doesnt clear this matter up once and for all. Comey was leading the FBIs investigation into Russian meddling in the US election when Trump fired him last month. Collins also said she thought Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller, who now leads the Russia probe, would be more likely than Congress to compel the release of any audio recordings. I would be fine with issuing a subpoena, Collins said. But that most likely would come from the special counsels office. Shortly after firing Comey, Trump issued a vague threat on Twitter, saying Comey had better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  The White House has refused to confirm or deny the existence of any tapes or recordings, and Trump hinted at a press conference in the Rose Garden on Friday that there actually arent any recordings of his meetings and phone calls with Comey. Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trumps private legal team, said Sunday on ABC News This Week that Trump will address the existence of any recordings in the coming week. The President also said at the Friday press conference that he would deny under oath Comeys claim that he privately asked him to back off his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. I didnt say that, Trump said of the claim about Flynn, who resigned in February after it emerged that he misled Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he held with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition.  Asked if he would testify under oath to Mueller to that effect, Trump replied: 100 percent, adding, I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you. For his part, Comey told the Senate intelligence committee in testimony Thursday, Lordy, I hope there are tapes because they would back his side off the story, which Trump has challenged. Trump attacked Comey again on Twitter on Sunday morning, calling Comey a coward and suggesting his decision pass his recollection of private conversations with Trump to the press could be illegal. Comeys word vs. Trumps  Trump and his lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, have denied Comey is telling the truth about his    conversations with Trump. Collins said she believed Comey did tell the truth in his testimony, in which he recounted his conversation with Trump about Flynn, but she also allowed for the possibility there was a misinterpretation. Regardless, she said, Trump was certainly wrong to say what Comey said he had about the Flynn investigation.  Collins said she believed Trump simply did not know how to behave and was unaware of the independence that an FBI director should be afforded. She said someone, either in the White House, the administration or Comey himself, should have set Trump straight. The President clearly does not fully understand or appreciate the boundaries, Collins said. But he should. Im not excusing his behavior."
Preet Bharara opens up about his interactions with Trump,CNN,Eli Watkins,6/11/2017,"Washington (CNN) Former US attorney Preet Bharara on Sunday talked about the three times Donald Trump called him, and the one time he didnt answer. Bharara was a US attorney until March, when the President fired him after Bharara refused to resign along with a raft of other   Justice Department attorneys. The sudden showdown came after several interactions with Trump during his transition to the presidency, when Bharara said he had two unusual phone calls with him. When Ive been reading the stories of how the President has been contacting (former FBI Director) Jim Comey over time, felt a little bit like deja vu, Bharara said on ABCs This Week. Trump invited Bharara to Trump Tower in New York a few weeks after the election, and Bharara said Trump asked him to stay on at the time.  Bharara said Trump called him twice during the transition ostensibly just to shoot the breeze. It was a little bit uncomfortable, Bharara said. But he was not the President. He was only the  . The former US attorney said Trump called him one more time    in March, after Trump had taken office.  I refused to return the call, Bharara said.  He said he talked to his team and reported the phone call to Attorney General Jeff Sessions chief of staff, saying it appeared Trump was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship. Bharara explained it was important for him to stay at arms length from the President given the   attorneys jurisdiction over business interests, including the Trump Organizations, in New York.  He also argued that Trump knew such outreach was problematic.  Bharara said 22 hours after he declined to return the call, he was asked to resign along with the other US attorneys.  Obstruction of justice, In the interview Sunday, Bharara said he thought there is enough evidence to open an investigation against Trump for obstruction of justice, but he warned people from jumping to a conclusion either way. No one knows right now whether there is a provable case of obstruction, Bharara said. He said he suspected Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller would look at obstruction of justice as part of the executive branchs investigation, saying it would be a reasonable assumption if Bob Mueller is looking at everything that you would expect him to look at. Good prosecutors look at everything. And this would seem to be one of those things that he was looking at. Bharara attended the Senate intelligence committee hearing featuring testimony from Comey on Thursday. Comey told the committee that Trump asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn during a private Oval Office meeting in February.  In a press conference Friday, Trump denied doing that, but also said there would be nothing wrong if he had. Flynn resigned in February after it emerged that he had misled Vice President Mike Pence about phone calls he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak."
"If there are tapes, can the White House be forced to turn them over?",CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/11/2017,"Washington (CNN) For President Richard Nixon, the controversy over his secret White House tape recordings began with a   at the Watergate Hotel. If President Donald Trump is also keeping recordings of his conversations, any controversy over those will have begun with a tweet. On May 12, three days after firing FBI Director James Comey, Trump tweeted: James Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press! Since then, the possible existence of audio recordings of Oval Office conversations have been a topic of conversation among many on Capitol Hill. The House intelligence committee has called on both the White House and Comey to hand over any material related to its Russia investigation, including memos and recordings, by June 23. But two questions remain: Are there actually audio recordings? And, if so, do Trump and the White House have to hand them over? The short version is, if there are tapes, and if they are subpoenaed, I think the White House will probably have to turn them over, said Stephen Vladeck, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law and a CNN legal analyst. More than four decades ago, the Senate voted to create a special investigative committee to look into the Watergate   and Archibald Cox, the Watergate special prosecutor, subpoenaed the White House tapes from Nixon.  Nixon citing executive privilege, refused to turn them over and sought to fire Cox. After his top two Justice Department officials resigned rather than carry out Nixons order to oust the special prosecutor, Solicitor General Robert Bork, who became acting attorney general, did fire Cox in October 1973 in what is referred to as the Saturday Night Massacre. In July 1974, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that Nixon had to turn over tape recordings of his conversations, and the next month, facing almost certain impeachment, Nixon resigned. Much has changed since then, but legal experts say the precedent set by the Nixon era remains the same. The Nixon example itself teaches us that executive privilege can be overcome, especially when the relevant information is potentially material for an ongoing criminal investigation, Vladeck said. According to Ronald Rotunda, who was an investigator during Watergate, turning over tapes is as much about politics as it is about the law. If there are tapes, it is probably not very difficult for the Justice Department to get them, Rotunda, a Chapman University law professor, told CNN. But whether the Senate or House can get tapes is really more politics than law. There have been disputes over the years    many, many years    between the president and the Congress on turning over material long before there were tapes. Should the White House fight a subpoena, Trumps tweets could end up hurting him. By talking about the content of those conversations publicly by tweeting, the President has already disclosed in substance what happened, Lisa Kern Griffin, a professor at Duke University School of Law, told CNN. And in doing that, he may have waived important aspects of executive privilege. Jay Sekulow, a member of President Trumps private legal team, said Sunday on ABC News This Week that Trump will address the existence of any recordings in the coming week."
Box Office: The Mummy Unravels as Wonder Woman Holds On to Top Spot,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/11/2017,"Warner Bros. superhero tentpole Wonder Woman held on to the top spot at the box office while Universals Tom   The Mummy reboot failed to unwrap big gains domestically as Hollywoods bleak summer continued this weekend. [Wonder Woman     starring Gal Gadot as the Amazonian   World War I peacekeeper     raked in $16 million Friday for an estimated $57. 2 million weekend total in its second week of release, according to Box Office Mojo. The   Patty   film, with a 93 percent fresh rating on reviews aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, fell just 45 percent in its second weekend for a   domestic total of $205 million. The film has fared even better overseas, with its international tally standing at $435 million.  Wonder Womans success     (the 45 percent   drop is the one of the lowest ever for a superhero movie)    provides a   shot in the arm to DCs   universe of superhero movies as Warners preps the launch of Justice League later this year. Meanwhile, Universals monster movie The Mummy debuted to a paltry estimated $32. 2 million   frame to come in second place for the weekend. The Tom   film, meant to launch Universals Dark Universe of   monster movies, reportedly cost $125 million to produce before marketing, meaning the film will have to perform exceptionally well overseas to turn a profit for the studio. For comparison, each of the three Brendan   Mummy films in the early 2000s opened higher than this latest iteration. Mummy did fare far better overseas, where Cruises name still carries a ton of star firepower. The film opened to an estimated $52. 2 million in China, a record for a   film in the country, on its way to an international total of $141. 8 million, the best international launch for any film in the actors career. Universal undoubtedly hoped for a better opening for Mummy, as it was meant to serve as the first film in its Dark Universe series. Upcoming entries in the series are reported to include a Bill   Bride of Frankenstein movie in 2019, and the Johnny   The Invisible Man. Dreamworks Animations Captain Underpants: The First Epic Movie came in third place with an estimated $12. 3 million haul. The animated movie featuring the voices of Kevin Hart and Ed Helms has earned $44. 5 million domestically, according to Box Office Mojo, a solid if unremarkable result for a film that reportedly cost just $30 million to produce. Disneys Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales continued its underwhelming run at the box office with a   estimated take of $10. 7 million and a   finish, bringing its domestic total to around $135 million. Johnny Depps fifth outing as the buoyant Captain Jack Sparrow has delivered overseas, however, with an estimated global tally of close to $600 million. Disneys Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 rounded out this weekends top five with an estimated $6. 2 million in domestic receipts. The James   superhero ensemble kicked off the summer season in early May with a $145 million debut weekend, and until Wonder Woman, was this summers only real box office hit. The films global haul stands at $828 million. Overall, the summer to date has been a disaster for studios, with only Wonder Woman and Guardians breaking out as bona fide hits. The season has suffered with a string of   bombs, including Mummy, the aforementioned Pirates sequel, the Ridley   sequel Alien: Covenant and Warner Bros. Charlie     King Arthur: Legend of the Sword. Other   misfires included Paramounts Baywatch reboot and the Amy   Hawn kidnap caper Snatched. According to Bloomberg, theater companies AMC and IMAX have seen their stock fall precipitously this year due in part to poor box office results. Cowen  Co. analyst Doug Creutz told the outlet that this summers offerings to date have collectively fallen $300 million short of expectations, and summer 2017 could beat out the summer of 2014 to become the worst summer at the box office since at least the  . Industry observers will be holding out hope for other scheduled   releases this summer, including next weekends Pixar animated sequel Cars 3, Michael Bay and Universals Transformers: The Last Knight, and Warner Bros Christopher   World War II epic Dunkirk. Other   movies will include Universals Despicable Me 3,   Pictures  : Homecoming and Foxs War for the Planet of the Apes. View this weekends full box office results at Box Office Mojo.

"Delta, Bank of America Drop Sponsorship of NYC Public Theater over Onstage Trump Stabbing",Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/11/2017,"Update: Bank of America has also cancelled its sponsorship of New York Citys Public Theater, becoming the second sponsor to pull its support from the this summers season of Shakespeare in the Park. [Bank of America supports art programs worldwide, including an   partnership with The Public Theater and Shakespeare in the Park, a spokesperson for the company told the New York Daily News Sunday. The Public Theater chose to present Julius Caesar in a way that was intended to provoke and offend. Had this intention been made known to us, we would have decided not to sponsor it.   Original story below: Delta Air Lines has cancelled its sponsorship of New York Citys Public Theater following backlash surrounding a Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar, a contemporary take on the classic play in which a Donald   twist on the titular character is graphically stabbed to death on stage. Breitbart News previously reported that this summers Oskar   production of Julius Caesar     which opened in previews last month in Central Parks Delacorte Theater     had sparked controversy over its main characters striking resemblance to President Trump. The character sports blonde,   hair and a business suit and tie, and his wife Calpurnia speaks with a Slavic accent, similar to that of First Lady Melania Trump. Video captured at a recent performance shows the   Caesar character graphically stabbed to death during the climax of the play. One attendee recently told Mediaite that the characters resemblance to Trump made the assassination scene particularly shocking and distasteful.  In the wake of the controversy, Delta Airlines has reportedly cancelled its sponsorship of the Public Theater, which stages the free productions of Shakespeare in the Park. No matter what your political stance may be, the graphic staging of Julius Caesar at this summers Free Shakespeare in the Park does not reflect Delta Air Lines values, the company said in a statement Sunday. Their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste. We have notified them of our decision to end our sponsorship as the official airline of the Public Theater effective immediately, the statement added. Other sponsors of the New York Citys Public Theater include American Express, the New York Times and Bank of America. The Delta sponsorship cancellation represents a blow to the Public Theater nearly two weeks after another controversy sparked by a graphic depiction of President Trumps death led to lost sponsorship and business opportunities. In May, comedian Kathy Griffin posed for a photograph with a fake, bloodied head of the president in her outstretched arm. The photograph generated a firestorm of criticism and Griffin was quickly fired from her role on CNNs annual New Years Eve Live broadcast. The comedian also lost out on a commercial deal with a restroom accessories company and had several scheduled performances on her   comedy tour cancelled.

"U.S. Stock Markets Hit Record Highs, but Tech Stocks Tumble - Breitbart",Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/11/2017,"U. S. stock markets charged to record highs last week, but a Goldman Sachs downgrade knocked down the so called FAAMG tech stocks that have led the Trump stock boom. [The Dow Jones Industrial Average [DJIA] rose 89. 44 points, or 0. 42 percent, to close at an    of 21, 271. 97 on June 9. The index, which includes many of Americas largest companies, is up by 7. 64 percent    and up 18. 27 percent in the last 12 months.  Goldman Sachs analyst Robert Bouroujerdi warned that the $600 billion outperformance by the 5 biggest tech stocks known as FAAMG     Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet     had contributed about 42 percent of all stock market gains over the last year. Goldman worries that the boom has created an valuation  similar to the ridiculously high valuations for tech stocks during the   boom, according to Zero Hedge. Bouroujerdi suggested that stock traders consider that after the 500 percent gain for the   NASDAQ index during the   bubble, which lasted from 1995 to 2001, the   bust that lasted until 2003 saw the NASDAQ lose 85% of its valuation. Goldmans    report on June 9 caused Facebook, Inc. [FB] to tank 3. 3 percent. Amazon. com, Inc. [AMZN] dropped by 3. 16 percent, Apple Inc. AAPL plunged 3. 88 percent, Microsoft Corporation [MSFT] was down by 2. 27 percent, and Googles parent Alphabet [GOOG] took a 3. 41 percent dive. There have been a tremendous number of doubters in the latest bull market, which has risen by 260. 5 percent since it began on March 9, 2009. During that period, there have been 12 market corrections of at least 5 percent, according to the Advisor Perspectives blog. During that fabulous run, the U. S. total nominal net worth of households and nonprofit organizations has zoomed from $56 trillion to $96 trillion through the end of the first quarter. That works out to about $292, 000 per capita. Stock market bulls highlight the current positive momentum in the real economy. It is widely known that the U. S. unemployment rate has fallen from 10 percent inn late 2009 to 4. 3 percent, the lowest level in 16 years. But the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics revealed June 6 that its Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) indicator reached an   record of 6, 044, 000 million jobs available at the end of May. Stock market bears are less optimistic. Billionaire commodity guru Jim Rogers, who correctly called the 2008 crash, told the Business Insider that the current combination of record debt and    real estate and stock valuations means that the next economic crash will be the biggest in my lifetime.  A more balanced view of the stock market comes from Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages $150 billion. He wrote earlier this month: Big picture, the near term looks good and the longer term looks scary.  He added, [W]e fear that whatever the magnitude of the downturn that eventually comes, whenever it eventually comes, it will likely produce much greater social and political conflict than currently exists."
12 Injured After Molotov Cocktail Explodes in Paris Restaurant - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/11/2017,"Twelve people, six of them police officers, were injured after a molotov cocktail exploded in a Paris restaurant. [Three people were airlifted to a hospital after suffering severe burns from the fire that started in Aubervilliers, a commune located in the northern part of Paris, around 8:30 p. m. Sunday, the Daily Mail reported.  Six police officers suffered minor burns as they tried to evacuate the building. News. com. au reported that the staff stopped an attempted robbery when the suspected robber threw the bomb at the restaurant. Police have not released a motive for the crime and did not say if it was an attack. Fifty firefighters arrived on the scene with 15 trucks to fight the fire. The restaurant is part of a   building, an emergency services source said. Everything is being done to contain the blaze, and search for other victims.  The incident took place the day of Frances parliamentary elections. France has spent 14 months under a state of emergency as a result of several terrorist attacks that ISIS and   have claimed responsibility for, France 24 reported. French President Emmanuel Macron, however, wants to end the state of emergency soon in favor of making some state of emergency powers, such as property searches without a warrant, part of common law. Police have not yet identified who is responsible for the attack and do not believe it is linked to terrorism."
What Its Like to Make It in Showbiz With Your Best Friend - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Paulson,6/11/2017,"They met at 18, the worst dancers in a college ballet class, and sought refuge in a basement practice room, taking a first stab at songwriting with a tune about adolescents playing hooky and footsie at a suburban diner. They went viral before going viral was a thing     their undergraduate years coincided with the birth of Facebook, and the first song cycle Benj Pasek and Justin Paul wrote, called Edges, was discovered, shared and performed by musical theater majors around the country. Now, at the age of 31, after a decade of being touted as promising,    and    Pasek and Paul have arrived. Their first original musical, Dear Evan Hansen, a daringly   show that explores the charged interplay between collective grief and social media after a misconstrued high school suicide, begins previews Monday, Nov. 14 and is generating prize chatter even before it opens on Broadway Dec. 4. Five days later, their first   Hollywood movie, La La Land, a romantic Ryan   Stone musical fantasia for which they wrote the lyrics, opens that film was the hit of this years festival circuit. But thats not all. In an era in which the film and television industries are showing a renewed interest in musicals, they have written all the songs for a movie starring Hugh Jackman     a P. T. Barnum biopic called The Greatest Showman     which is now in rehearsal and scheduled for release late next year by 20th Century Fox. Disney has hired them to write new songs for a   remake of Snow White.  Oh, and they even have a song in Trolls, the DreamWorks Animation comedy that opened early this month. I love them, said Robert Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment, who hired the pair to write three songs for the television show Smash, and became so enamored that he is now a   on Dear Evan Hansen.  To me, theyre the future of the musical, on stage or screen.  Musical theater history is peopled by   pairings. And even before they graduated from the University of Michigan, Pasek and Paul     thats the branding they fell into as    their surnames in alphabetical order     have been prospectively placed in the pantheon. Rodgers  Hart. Lerner  Loewe. Pasek  Paul? It has a nice ring to it, said a university publication in 2006. They are handsome and charming,   and exuberant, observant, obsessive, and, of course, neurotic. Mr. Pasek writes words, and Mr. Paul writes music, but they have opted, right from the beginning, to share credit for both elements of their songs. They estimate that they spend 350 days a year together, for six to 12 hours at a stretch, sending texts and video clips back and forth when they are not in the same room, and even sometimes when they are. Everything that weve studied and loved has all built to get to be in a moment like this, Mr. Paul said during a joint interview at Sardis, surrounded by caricatures of the industrys greatest talents. Our goal was always, if we could just write songs and tell stories, and get to do that every day, thats our dream.  [A Pasek and Paul primer: six videos to watch] Although their sensibility is contemporary, they are deeply rooted in the musical theater tradition, and their sound is somewhere on the border between show tunes and pop     they are not part of the   revolution on Broadway. They have proven especially deft at musicalizing emotional yearning: The 11 oclock number in Dear Evan Hansen is a poignant effort by an apologetic single mother (Rachel Bay Jones) to comfort her disconsolate son (Ben Platt). In La La Land, the climactic song is a stirring recollection by an aspiring actress (Ms. Stone) reflecting on inspiration at a casting call. I think were attracted to material thats hopeful and messy, and in that mess, theres an attempt at getting at truth, Mr. Pasek said. They are, on the surface, quite different from each other. Mr. Paul, who lives in Harlem, is a churchgoing Christian from Westport, Conn. straight married and the father of a    daughter. Mr. Pasek, who grew up in Ardmore, Pa. and now lives on the Upper West Side, is gay, Jewish and single. But they both began as little boys who loved to sing. Mr. Paul, a talented pianist, started early. At age 3, he was singing gospel music with his father, a pastor, in church. Later, he sang and danced at senior centers with Music Theater of Connecticut and then, at Staples High School, he performed in Into the Woods, conducted the orchestra in Hello, Dolly! and spent his free time poring over Broadway fake books, which help pianists master melodies. Mr. Pasek also sang with a parent: His mother is a developmental psychologist and professor with a propensity for bursting into song. (Shes like a   musical theater character, in the best possible way, he said.) She wrote and performed songs from a childs point of view (They were a big hit on the synagogue circuit, he said) and he remembers guest starring with her at about age 7. Mr. Pasek sang and traveled with the Philadelphia Boys Choir  Chorale, and then, as a student at Friends Central School, performed in musicals including Bye Bye Birdie and 42nd Street.  They compare themselves to brothers, who bicker and bond, knowing their relationship will endure. A recent fight, over whose bad habits were to blame for their difficulty replacing the final first act song in Dear Evan Hansen, sent Mr. Pasek stalking out of their Columbus Circle studio into the street, but then, 10 minutes later, calling Mr. Paul for a lengthy   that prompted the pair to ditch the disputed number and start over. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul met the summer before college, at a freshman orientation weekend, and connected over a shared sense of humor, a passion for the work of Jason Robert Brown and an obsession with Merrily We Roll Along.  (The title Edges alludes to a Merrily lyric.) Mr. Pasek wanted to record some songs he had written as a high school senior, and he recruited Mr. Paul as an arranger and accompanist with that, their collaboration began. They mined their own experiences, and those of their friends, for material, acting out songs as they wrote. I kept watching them observe the social experiment of college and find ways to articulate it, said Nick Blaemire, a fellow Michigan student who is now an actor in New York, recalling a night when he told Mr. Pasek about his difficulty expressing love to a girlfriend, and seeing that become I Hmm You.  Raised in the digital age, and aware of the role social media played in fueling their popularity, they have demonstrated an ease promoting their work     at first with CDs and a homespun tour of Edges, and more recently with producers, performers and journalists     that has served them well. Theyre salesmen, and always have been     they know how to explain what theyre doing and why theyre doing it, Mr. Blaemire said. Michael Gracey, the director of The Greatest Showman, had imagined asking a number of songwriters to contribute songs to his film, but, as he talked with Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul about the movie, abandoned that plan to give them all the work. He even videotaped their songwriting sessions, convinced that they would be of significance for posterity. I cant even begin to describe the enormous impact those two have had on this film, he said. The director of La La Land, Damien Chazelle, had a similar experience: He was looking for seasoned lyricists who could write words for songs composed by Justin Hurwitz when Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul, seeking the gig, gave him proposed lyrics for a song called City of Stars.  That became a signature number. It was screamingly obvious that we had stumbled onto a gold mine with these guys, and we brought them on right away, Mr. Chazelle said. Their promise was evident as soon as they started writing together. Brent Wagner, the emeritus chairman of the musical theater program at the University of Michigan, still remembers the night in 2005 when Mr. Blaemire, then a junior, persuaded him to stop by the Kerrytown Concert House in Ann Arbor to see Edges.  It was a youthful work, and it wasnt completely advanced     there wasnt even music written down     but it was marvelous, and at that moment, you knew you were in the midst of real talent and real understanding of theater craft, Mr. Wagner said. By the time they left school, he said, we knew it would just be a matter of time.  Jeff Marx, the Tony     of Avenue Q, was equally convinced     so sure that he placed a bet on them. A Michigan alumnus, he had taken on Mr. Pasek as an assistant in the summer of 2005. (I looked at his Friendster profile and he seemed like a nice kid. ) The next year, when Mr. Pasek asked to return, Mr. Marx told him he needed to stop interning and focus on writing shows with Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul couldnt afford to write full time     he needed to earn money for school     but Mr. Marx was so intent that he offered to give Mr. Paul money in lieu of what he would have earned from a summer job. Then, when Mr. Paul said he was unwilling to accept charity, Mr. Marx repositioned his offer as a wager, staking him $7, 000, to be repaid only if Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul made it to Broadway within the next decade. It happened, but in an unexpected way. They had a frustrating experience adapting the Roald Dahl childrens book James and the Giant Peach, which was mounted at Goodspeed Musicals in 2010, and has been revised since. They remain proud of their songs, and the show is still being produced at small theaters, but the Dahl estate has decided to restrict professional productions to make room for a different adaptation. Their musical version of the 1991 film Dogfight was presented at Second Stage, Off Broadway, in 2012, and was generally admired, but not well enough to make the leap to Broadway. But after the initial songwriter for the adaptation of the 1983 family film A Christmas Story was let go, they were brought in     and nominated for a Tony Award     when the show, which was developed to tour, ended up transferring to Broadway in 2012. Six years after Mr. Marxs bet, Mr. Paul handed him a check at the opening night party. My money was safe, Mr. Marx said. Other mentors have stepped in, too. Stephen Schwartz, the writer of Pippin and Wicked, has been advising them since Mr. Paul met him as an undergraduate. Mr. Schwartz recommended them to Lynn Ahrens and Stephen Flaherty (Ragtime) who admitted them to a Dramatists Guild fellowship. Ms. Ahrens and Mr. Flaherty assigned them to observe the development of Next to Normal, where they met the director Michael Greif (best known for Rent) who is now directing Dear Evan Hansen.  The new show was borne from an observation Mr. Pasek had about how his own high school community reacted when a former student died unexpectedly he noted the desire of many, including himself, to be counted among the bereaved for someone they did not know well. Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul had talked about the idea for years when a producer, Stacey Mindich, who had helped commission Dogfight, offered to finance their dream project. She introduced them to the work of a playwright, Steven Levenson, who became the Dear Evan Hansen book writer, turning their musings into a narrative. The show, developed through   productions last year at Arena Stage in Washington and this year Off Broadway at Second Stage, features a   performance by the    Mr. Platt (Pitch Perfect). As a high school student he had discovered Pasek and Paul via YouTube, and sang one of the Edges songs at a senior concert. (Mr. Platt is not the only Pasek and Paul fan in his family     his father, Marc Platt, is the producer of La La Land and Snow White. ) The duos work demonstrates an understanding of the contemporary lives of teenagers, but several of their collaborators have also been struck by their empathy for parents. The insight they seem to have into the heart of a   mother has been there as long as Ive known them, said Ms. Jones, who has played Pasek and Paul mothers in A Christmas Story and Dear Evan Hansen.  They use these tiny moments to describe enormous feelings that have no words     a lyric about a Ninja Turtle   or glow stars on the ceiling, she said, referring to a song that was used during the early stages of Dear Evan Hansen.  Both Ms. Jones and Mr. Platt distinctly remember the day Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul brought in a new song, So   Small, in which her character describes the impact of the breakup of her marriage on his characters childhood. It makes you die inside because its so real, she said. Mr. Platt agreed. Everybody was a big wreck.  As they now prepare for the openings of the musical and movie, Mr. Pasek and Mr. Paul describe what looks like sudden success as largely a coincidence. They have been working on Dear Evan Hansen for six years, they finished writing songs for Trolls and La La Land more than a year ago, and they havent yet begun work on Snow White.  But still     on one particularly busy recent day, they started in Dumbo, Brooklyn, at 8:30 a. m. for a Greatest Showman script meeting traveled to Midtown to tweak Dear Evan Hansen arrangements with their orchestrator, Alex Lacamoire split up so Mr. Paul could go to a Chelsea studio to record tracks for Showman while Mr. Pasek sat in on auditions for Mr. Platts understudy went to MoMA for a screening of La La Land hosted by Jennifer Lawrence and then to an   at the Rainbow Rooms Bar SixtyFive. Most days arent nearly that varied or that glamorous. And at the start of each project, it is still the two of them, trying to figure out how to tell a story through music. Nothing changes     the next time we have to write a song were going to sit down at a piano and bang our heads against it for a long time and talk ourselves blue in the face about what it should be, Mr. Paul said. Mr. Pasek jumped in, finishing the thought: Facing the blank page doesnt get any easier."
Left-Wing American Constitution Society Urges Deep State to Undermine Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/11/2017,"The Washington Examiner has published an account of a meeting of the American Constitution Society     the lefts version of the conservative Federalist Society of lawyers     at which participants discussed how to encourage the deep state to undermine President Donald Trump. [Ryan Lovelace of the Examiner reported Saturday:  Forlorn liberals took refuge at the American Constitution Societys national convention in Washington this week, discussing whether to encourage the growth of the deep state resistance inside the government or fight President Trump from outside.        UCLA law professor Jon Michaels said he favors filling the Trump administration with liberals opposed to Trumps agenda. We hear a lot of language about draining the swamp and this idea about a deep state that somehow was going to thwart the intentions or the political mandate of the president, Michaels said. I kind of embrace this notion of the deep state.  Michaels listed his ideas for how to ensure the success of the deep state.  Act as a group     a department, across agency lines, as a community     rather than as an individual when pushing back against Trump from the inside, he said. Once such a coalition is formed, he suggested rogue tweeting or leaking to the media as options for fighting the president. Some present also discussed the possibility of using federalism to oppose Trump. For more than a century, liberals have opposed federalism, preferring rule by the federal government over allowing states to govern their own affairs. However,   states like California have newfound enthusiasm for federalism     although their version has more to do with ignoring federal law altogether, rather than exercising state powers and prerogatives.

"U.S.-Backed Afghan Government Funding Taliban Schools, Hospitals",Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/11/2017,"The U. S.   Afghan government is reportedly funding schools and hospitals operated by the Taliban as the terrorist group attempts to establish itself as a legitimate administration in the large swathes of the country under its control. [They are trying to set up a       if not the actual state     in Helmand, Auliya Atrafi, a journalist from the BBC Afghan service who made a film about the deteriorating security conditions there, told the Telegraph.  In the evening when we sat with the [Taliban] elders and the local leaders, they asked us: Where do you think we will be in 10 years time? We knew what they were thinking. They see themselves in ten years time as the government, added the BBC journalist. Citing the U. S. forces in Afghanistan, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR) revealed that jihadists, primarily the Taliban, contest or control 40 percent of Afghanistan. In particular, the Taliban controls or influences 64 percent (nine of 14 districts) of   Helmand province, located along the Pakistan border next to Kandahar, the birthplace of the terrorist group. The Telegraph reports that the Taliban controls at least 80 percent of Helmand province, considered one of the deadliest provinces of the ongoing    war for the   coalition and their Afghan allies. Taliban jihadists generate 60 percent of its funding from the illicit opium business in Afghanistan, the worlds top producer of the poppy plant, according to the U. S. military. The American government has invested more than $117 billion in U. S. taxpayer funds on reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan. Most of those funds (more than $71 billion) have been devoted to training, housing, equipping, and sustaining the Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) in their fight against the Taliban and other jihadist groups. Nevertheless, the Telegraph points out, the Afghan government is funding schools and hospitals run by the Taliban as the militant group seeks to establish itself as a legitimate administration in large swathes of the country, a new film has found.  A report by a BBC team granted rare access to the groups stronghold in Helmand province found the Taliban has been forced to present itself as somewhat modernized since Afghans have grown used to government services and a different way of life after the group was ousted from official power, it adds. An estimated 300 U. S. Marines have recently returned to the   Helmand. The U. S.  coalition overthrew the Taliban regime in 2001, soon after invading Afghanistan in response to the   attacks on the U. S homeland. Afghanistan has been gripped by a Taliban resurgence since former President Barack Obama declared an end to the U. S. combat mission at the end of 2014. The Taliban has grown in confidence three years since Western troops withdrew from the country, declares the Telegraph."
The people behind the popular Mass Effect games have a brand new title: Anthem,Business Insider,Jeff Dunn,6/11/2017,"The newest title from popular video game developer BioWare has   been revealed, and its called Anthem.     Electronic Arts, the games publisher, gave a very brief tease of   the new game at an event on Saturday. EAs event marked the   unofficial beginning of E3, the biggest annual trade show in the   video game industry.     The company unveiled only a   teaser trailer, with little   indication of how Anthem actually plays. So theres not much to   say just yet. Based on what weve got, though, we can say there   are robot suits, gnarly monsters, and dramatic   undertones.      You can get a sense for yourself below:       If all of this raises your interest, you wont have to wait long   for more details: EA says a fuller reveal will come at   Microsofts planned Xbox event on Sunday.      Anthem is notable for being the  next intellectual property from Canadian   game maker BioWare, which has created a number of   acclaimed action and   games over the years. The   most popular of those is likely the  though that franchises last   installment, this years Mass Effect: Andromeda, was seen as   something of a  .

Fake News: New York Times Targets Breitbart for Reporting Truth - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/11/2017,"The New York Times ran a story on Saturday implicating Breitbart News in what it claimed was a misleading effort to state that former FBI Director James Comey had testified under oath that he had not been pressured to stop an investigation. [The Times Jeremy W. Peters     normally one of its more credible journalists     reported that a tweet by Jack Posobiec led Breitbart News and other conservative outlets to conclude     falsely, in its view     that Comey had exonerated President Donald Trump of wrongdoing, under oath.  Mr. Posobiec wrote on May 17 that Mr. Comey, the recently ousted F. B. I. director, had said under oath that Trump did not ask him to halt any investigation, the Times reported. It mattered little that Mr. Comey had said no such thing. The tweet quickly ricocheted through the ecosystem of fake news and disinformation on the far right, where Trump partisans like Mr. Posobiec have intensified their efforts to sow doubt about the legitimacy of expanding investigations into Trump associates ties to Russia. The Times included Breitbart News in that ecosystem, citing an article at Breitbart News that mentioned Posobiecs tweet. But the Breitbart article was careful to note that Comeys testimony on May 8 had not responded specifically to a question about whether Trump himself had asked him to stop an investigation. It did draw the inference that Comeys comment could have included Trump     but was precise in its language: Although Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) didnt specifically ask about Trump in the question she posed to Comey, the inquiry was about whether or not he had experienced having a higher authority stop an FBI investigation.  The inference is not the only possible one     but neither is the inference that the Times prefers to draw against Trump, and to present as established fact. The Breitbart headline also did not specifically mention Trump. Comey did not volunteer any information about Trump during that testimony. He only accused Trump of having asked him to stop the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn     by allegedly expressing a hope     once Comey had been fired. Joel B.

Drain the Swamp! Feds Cleaning Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool After Parasite Kills 80 Ducklings,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/11/2017,"The National Park Service announced on Friday that the reflecting pool in the shadow of the Lincoln Memorial will be drained and cleaned following the death of about 80 duckling from a parasite that grows on snails. [Chemical treatments cant kill the parasites and snails, so the Reflecting Pool must be drained and cleaned, according to an NPS statement obtained by the Washington Post, the Hill reported.  The park service is expected to start draining the pool today and its expected to be refilled beginning on June 16. The pool draining follows a May project by the Architect of the Capitol, in conjunction with nonprofit City Wildlife, to build a duck ramp to help ducklings go in and out of the Capitols reflecting pool, the Hill reported. Duckling update: The full journey in. pic. twitter.      U. S. Capitol (@uscapitol) May 19, 2017,  The Capitol reflecting pool is located on the opposite end of the National Mall from the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool. Its not the first time the ducklings have made the news. In 1999 the Los Angeles Times wrote about the death of baby ducks from predators and the demand that the National Park Service do something to help them. Baby ducks, born in recent weeks at Constitution Gardens on the Mall, never survived their first swim because predators from the sky and the lake snatched the tiny creatures as fast as they put their webbed feet in the water, the Times reported. A similar fate has befallen nearly every duckling born at Constitution Gardens in the last five years   a stark illustration of natures food chain, according to the National Park Service, the Time reported. Since   more than 90 baby ducks have become snacks for the bass and catfish in the 7    lake, as well as for the herons drawn to the area because of the fish. But the duck community is thriving at the nearby and   Reflecting Pool in front of the Lincoln Memorial.  As long as theres not a human cause for the problem, we try to let nature take its course, said Stephen Lorenzetti, chief of the Division of Resource Management at National Capital Parks Central. You have some people who want to save the wildlife at all costs, and that would be nice, but part of the goal is to keep the area as natural as we can."
Leftist Rage Unleashed Against The Last Night Creator During E3 Gaming Expo - Breitbart,Breitbart,Allum Bokhari,6/11/2017,"The Last Night is a dystopian, cyberpunk game with a Blade Runner feel, offering players a chance to explore a visually striking world that combines 3D and   graphics. [The game, developed by newcomer Tim Soret, turned heads when it was revealed earlier today at E3, the worlds largest gaming expo.  It also attracted the fury of the social justice left, after it emerged that Soret once supported the GamerGate movement, which criticized feminist and leftist attempts to make the world of gaming politically correct. Soret has also said he opposes feminism but supports egalitarianism. Well, there goes my interest in The Last Night pic. twitter.      Elite Bear Agents (@Bearpigman) June 11, 2017,  Sorets claim that GamerGate was an egalitarian movement is borne out by the evidence. Two surveys of the movements political views, including my own, found that a majority of the movement were   liberals who happened to disagree with censorship and political correctness. One survey even found that most GamerGate supporters voted for Barack Obama in 2012. Zoe Quinn, the feminist games designer whose complaints about allegedly sexist internet trolls drove coverage of GamerGate, was quick to condemn Soret for endorsing the   consumer movement. If you laid down with MRAs, abusive ex boyfriends, LITERAL NAZIS, et all, you deserve fleas.     thought daddy (@UnburntWitch) June 12, 2017,  Quinn is famous for Being Mad Online, and has arguably elevated the practice to an art form. She was even invited to the United Nations in 2015 to lecture the world on the dangers of cyberviolence.  Progressive anger is likely to increase when they learn more about the games political message, which offers a moderate critique of the left.  The game takes place in a future dystopia brought about by the rise of intelligent machines. Work has been abolished, and all humans (aside from the games protagonist) are sustained by a universal income. However, the abolition of work     historically a leftist goal     does not lead to utopia. From the games website: Humans first knew the era of survival. Then they knew the era of work. Now they live in the era of leisure. Machines have surpassed human labour not only in strength, but in precision, intellect, and creativity. Stabilised by universal income, people struggle to find their calling or identity, and define themselves by what they consume, rather than what they create. According to Heat Street, Soret originally envisaged the game as a warning against extreme progressivism. I find it interesting to show the danger of extreme progressivism, in the background of the game, the characters, and the story. Finally, well have another take on the cyberpunk oppression instead of Big     companies. What if the surveillance, bullying, marginalization wont come from governments but from the Internet? Leftists have been known to freak out when their favourite entertainers fail to make their acts sufficiently  . If political neutrality is objectionable to leftists, the thought of a smart, visually appealing entertainment product that actually critiques their goals would send them into a tailspin. It remains unclear, however, whether Sorets views have changed since the comments published by Heat Street. In the wake of the controversy, Soret reiterated his belief in equality  inclusiveness but also acknowledged that the game will challenge   progress as a whole.  Controversy time. Thats fine. Lets talk about it, because its important. 1     I completely stand for equality  inclusiveness.     Tim Soret @E3 (@timsoret) June 12, 2017,  3     The fictional setting of the game does challenge   progress as a whole but certainly not trying to promote regressive ideas.     Tim Soret @E3 (@timsoret) June 12, 2017,  Nevertheless, expect little, if any news coverage in the mainstream gaming press about The Last Night, apart from outraged  . Now that its developers former GamerGate sympathies have been revealed, however, politicized elements of the gaming press are unlikely to judge the game by its artistic merits alone. Unfortunately for them, some   gaming outlets already published pieces on The Last Nights launch trailer before news of its creators GamerGate heresy spread on social media. The Verge, a Vox publication, called the trailer gorgeous.  Polygon, regarded as one of the most leftist gaming sites, and hailed it as one of the   indie games showed off by Microsoft at E3. Bleeding Cool praised its vibrant and highly stylized feel, while PC Gamer called it stunning.  The Last Night is scheduled for release in 2018 on PC and Xbox One.

"Justice Department argues its fine for Trump to take payments from foreign governments, citing George Washington",Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/11/2017,"The Justice Department  the US Constitution by   accepting payments from foreign governments without congressional   approval at his litany of Trump Organization businesses, hoping   to have a lawsuit claiming otherwise thrown out in federal court.     The government claimed that if the Emoluments Clause     a section   of the Constitution that bars members of the government from   receiving such payments or gifts from foreign governments without   congressional approval      is interpreted to mean that Trump   cannot accept such payments at his hotels, golf course, and other   venues, that reading would mean even the nations first   president, George Washington, would have been found in violation.     In the Friday filing, the government argued that the clause   does not apply to   transactions, such as hotel bills   or   fees. The Justice Department is asking a New York   judge to throw out a lawsuit filed by the   watchdog   group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, which   sued Trump in late January under the claim that he was already   violating that clause of the Constitution.     In its filing, the Justice Department wrote that neither the   text nor the history of the clauses shows that they were intended   to reach benefits arising from a presidents private business   pursuits having nothing to do with his office or personal service   to a foreign power.     Were plaintiffs interpretation correct, presidents from the   very beginning of the Republic, including George Washington,   would have received prohibited emoluments, the US government   filing said. The filing argued CREW did not have the standing to   file a suit.      CREW, which has been leading force in combating the   administration on   issues, is additionally seeking   access to Trumps taxes in the suit.     Its clear from the governments response that they dont   believe anyone can go to court to stop the president from   systematically violating the constitution, CREW   communications director Jordan Libowitz said in a statement. We   heartily disagree and look forward to our day in court.     Just prior to taking office, Trump announced he had turned over   control of his businesses to his eldest sons, Eric and Donald   Jr. in addition to a top Trump Organization official. The Trumps   pledged to make no new deals outside of the US as a part of the   agreement. But CREW, along with leading Democrats and ethicists,   have called for Trump to either place his businesses into a blind   trust or liquidate his assets.  The Justice Department argued Friday that. .."
Report: Palestinian Delegation to Meet Trump Officials in DC This Month,Breitbart,Breitbart Jerusalem,6/11/2017,"The Jerusalem Post reports: A delegation of five Palestinian officials is expected to meet with US President Donald Trumps administration in Washington, D.

Michael Jordans brand is making one big mistake,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,6/11/2017,"The greatest of all time may be losing his edge.     Jordan Brand, the biggest name in athletic footwear, has been on   a slide recently and it could be weighing on Nike.     During a recent conference call with Jefferies analyst Randy   Konik, Josh Luber, the CEO of sneaker resale platform StockX,   laid out the issues facing the Jordan Brand and how it could try   and combat the problems going forward.     According to Luber, as of January 2015, Jordan Brand made up 96%   of the shoe resale market and Adidas was down to around 1%.   Nowadays, said Luber, Adidas has 45% market share.     So, in two and half years, [Adidas] basically went from   nonexistent or 1 percent call it, to about 45 percent of the   resell market in terms of dollars, Luger said. And all of that   share comes right from Nike and Jordan, because theres nowhere   else really for it to come from, and mainly from Jordan   Brand.      Luber said that the slipping market share of the Jordan Brand is   due to two big issues facing the company:     Luber said that the second issue, oversupply, was the one that   really mattered. Jordan Brand has maintained a relatively lofty   reputation since its introduction due to its limited supply. By   eroding this Brand value, the   negative for Nike could   be substantial.     Additionally, by maintaining a higher reputation this prevents   the shoes from being subject to other factors like the style   issue.     In the end, the solution, according to Luber, is to rebuild   the Jordan mystique by limiting the supply once again. The only   problem is that may have other adverse effects on Nikes overall   business.     And its (  sword) right because I dont know what it   would do to revenues or earnings to start really cutting back on   supply of Jordans, and how do you get that elsewhere, Luber   said.     But long term and for the Brand, for protecting the Jordan   Brand, thats definitely what I think they should be doing.  The greatest of all time may be losing his. .."

Bankrupt Puerto Rico Voting on U.S. Statehood - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/11/2017,"The 3. 4 million U. S. citizens on the Caribbean island of Puerto Ricans will vote today, for the fifth time, on a   referendum to become independent or to apply to be Americas 51st state, despite already declaring bankruptcy last month. [Puerto Rico has a poverty rate of 45 percent, 12. 4 percent unemployment, and 86 percent of residents do not speak English in the home, but the island receives $22 billion in federal subsidies. The top income tax rate is 4 percent and residents are exempt from paying $2 billion in federal income taxes. That explains why 61 percent of residents voted for statehood in 2012, but nothing happened.  As Breitbart News reported several weeks ago, Puerto Rico filed the largest municipal bankruptcy in the history of the United States on May 3. The island and its   utility ran out of cash and defaulted on its $73 billion of debt. After the filing, Breitbart reported that Puerto Ricos public pension plans only have $1. 8 billion in assets to pay $45 billion in liabilities. Christopher Columbus first arrived at Puerto Rico in 1493 and named the island San Juan Bautista. But after gold was discovered in a river, it was given the Spanish name for rich port.  The conquistadors Spanish combined the labor of indigenous Tano and Carib Indian people with African slaves to operate large sugar cane, coffee and tobacco farms. After the   War, Puerto Rico joined Cuba, the Philippines and Guam as war booty paid to the U. S. under the Treaty of Paris of 1898. Puerto Ricans received U. S. citizenship in 1917 and officially became a U. S. Commonwealth in 1952. The island is often referred to as the Oldest Colony in the World.  A U. S. District Court in New York City has jurisdiction over the congressionally mandated oversight board for Puerto Ricos Title III bankruptcy. According to initial bankruptcy filings, the per capita debt for each man, woman and child in Puerto Rico is about $34, 000. The islands median household income was $18, 626 in 2015, versus $56, 500 for the U. S. mainland. Much of the debt is now held by vulture capitalist hedge funds that bought bonds for as little as 25 percent of face value. The investors claim that Puerto Rico can regain its solvency by raising taxes and firing tens of thousands of public sector workers. Bloomberg reported just as the Puerto Rico crisis began, investors and the island have fighting over who owns cash collected by the governments sales tax agency, known by its Spanish acronym Cofina.  The island claims that despite not making any bond payments, the island will miss payroll on November 1 if the sales tax is paid out to bondholders. Breitbart News has suggested that  Puerto Ricos bankruptcy filing represents a massive liability risk for independent auditors, who will likely demand that   states     such as Connecticut, Illinois and California     disclose more liabilities, write down assets, and curtail debt issues. Greater accounting scrutiny of municipal and state finances will lead to credit rating downgrades and requirements for higher pension payments. That may explain why California Governor Jerry Brown warned in his   May Budget Revision update that California is expected to suffer a $20 billion tax crash in the next recession."
Teslas greatest weakness is also one of its key advantages,Business Insider,Matthew DeBord,6/11/2017,"Tesla is now a bigger carmaker, by market capitalization, than General Motors, Ford, and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Its closing in on some huge global players, such as Toyota and Volkswagen. And a  $  valuation has come while constantly losing money and building a small number of expensive electric cars over 13 years of existence. CEO Elon Musk doesnt want anyone at Tesla to get cocky, so lately hes taken to exhorting the company to remain lean and mean, painting Tesla as a little guy thats under constant threat from far more   competitors. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Its convenient to call every new   concept that comes out from a startup or a major automaker a Tesla Killer, but the car business isnt particularly interested in killing Tesla. The reason is simple: For roughly the past five years, since Tesla rolled its Model S sedan, the company has served as   for the auto industry. Musk makes all the grand, daring, wildly costly moves. Then the GMs and Toyotas of the world sit back and see how it goes. GM has already transformed this process into something that puts cars on the road. Prompted by Tesla, the colossal automaker rapidly developed and marketed its own   affordable EV, the Chevy Bolt. It launched last fall, about a full year ahead of Teslas similar Model 3.  Tesla could easily have matched that and put the Model 3 into owners driveways faster. The incentive was certainly there, as the vehicle racked up an unprecedented 400, 000   when it was unveiled in early 2016. Any other carmaker would have seen that number and, if it didnt have the capacity to build vehicles rapidly to satisfy demand, would have brought in a contract manufacturer to do the work. Magna International is the biggest contract manufacturing in the world, assembling cars for the likes of BMW. Musk could have put in a call last spring and had Model 3s . .. well, maybe now.  But that would have been too easy. Teslas pattern is to never, ever push the easy button. Musk is a complicated thinker who likes to do everything the hard way. Humans have been   cars from over 100 years, and in the time have gotten quite good at it. But dont tell that to Tesla. Its cars are pretty superb, but their births are always fraught.  The Model S suffered early production issues. The Model X SUV was three years overdue, and when it finally did arrive in late 2015, its design was so    that initial production and quality control were a disaster. Musk pitched a sleeping bag on the factory floor in Fremont, Calif. and endured six months of what he called production hell, admitting that the Model X was an example of hubris.  He pledge to keep it simple with the Model 3, but although the vehicle sounds as if it will be less difficult to build, Musk is taking some major risks with its introduction. The largest of these is skipping the assembly prototyping stage, when Tesla would normally determine if the production process for the Model 3 yields vehicles of satisfactory quality and can be run in an efficient manner.  Instead, Tesla will dive in headfirst with Model 3 assembly and hope for the best, like a tech firm releasing potentially buggy software that it can fix later. Except that software is a large machine that can effortlessly exceed the legal speed limit. This could be a disaster. But there are other do it the hard way elements of the way Tesla is being run to point to. At an overarching level, trying to take whats basically a car company and transform it into a battery manufacturer (with the $  Gigafactory in Nevada) an energy storage company (through Tesla Energy) and a solar provider (by merging with SolarCity) makes Teslas business just   difficult to understand or accurately value. Moving down the levels, the company has decided to start talking about its   and its next vehicle, the Model Y compact crossover, when it ought to be laser focused in not screwing up the Model 3 launch because its decided to cut corners with the assembly line. But there were both the semi and the Model Y, touted at Teslas most recent shareholder meeting. To make matters worse, Musk is now talking about using the Model Y as an experiment in reinventing manufacturing with a new, highly automated factory, constructing the Model Y on a different platform from the Model 3. This is happening with the small SUV market booming     and Tesla having no small SUV to sell. By the time Musks magic becomes a hopeful reality, the market may have turned south, and with it sales and revenues that Tesla could be booking.  So why is Tesla making everything so hard? My sense is that its driven by a relentless craving for the Tesla Story. In this telling, Tesla must be a plucky Silicon Valley startup tilting at the massive global auto industry. And it must be under assault by that industry, despite the fact that nobody in the traditional industry has the slightest interest in Tesla failing. They dont fear Musk     they admire him, and for good reason. He has done the nearly impossible by creating the first new American car company in decades. Tesla must also be largely   an automaking pioneer in the electric West. Vertical integration vanished from the car business in the 1980s, replaced by the   lean manufacturing model. But Musk wants to bring vertical integration back. However, a   approach, at least until Tesla can unleash a thousand robots, will just slow down the company, at a time when it urgently needs to speed up. Theres also been a subtle yet menacing shift in thinking about Teslas future by market optimists. With a   built, for the moment, on almost nothing, Tesla has to be dominant in some future transportation paradigm. Otherwise, the predicted profits wont materialize. Tesla needs to be a monopoly. Creating a monopoly in the car business isnt simply hard     it could be inconceivable. Over a dozen major automakers slice up the global pie and compete fiercely against each other. This is nothing like the state of affairs in the tech industry, where competition is the enemy.  As a result, car buyers currently enjoy a massive amount of choice, while smartphone buyers are stuck with basically two operating system choices: Apples iOS and Android. So the new idea for Tesla is so hard that, frankly, it defies analysis. But its Musks mission to prepare his troops for the battle. And hes not backing down.  Tesla is now a bigger carmaker, by market. .."

Can you be a street fighter on all things all the time and still be a good president? My advice to the president is every day you are talking about Jim Comey and not the American people and their needs and their desires, their hopes and their dreams, you are making a mistake. DICKERSON: Is he getting in the way of his own agenda? GRAHAM: Yes, totally. At the end, he has got a good agenda. But this does get in the way of it. So, the hearing was pretty good. No collusion with the Russians yet. I dont think obstruction of justice exists here. But every time you tweet about Comey, it is almost like wait for the next wrestling match between Comey and Trump. It should be about what can Donald Trump do to help the lives of American people and sort of get out of the way here. DICKERSON: Do you think the president was vindicated? He thought he was vindicated       (CROSSTALK) GRAHAM: Well, I think it was true that he is not under investigation for colluding with the Russians. And I dont think what was said amounts to obstruction of justice. Now, what the president did was inappropriate. But here is what is so frustrating for Republicans like me. You may be the first president in history to go down because you cant stop inappropriately talking about an investigation that, if you just were quiet, would clear you. It is frustrating for me to want to help a man who I think will do big things no other Republican will do, like immigration. Believe it or not, I think Donald Trump may deliver us from a broken immigration system. This is not helping. But this should be in the Judiciary Committee. I heard Dianne Feinstein on a show earlier today. You had Comey suggest that the current U. S. attorney general and the former attorney general were playing politics with the investigation, Lynch and Sessions. That needs to be in our committee. Let me tell this to the American people. If the attorney generals office has become a political office, that is bad for us all. So I want to get to the bottom of that, and it should be in Judiciary.

Preet Bharara: Theres Absolutely Evidence to Begin a Case for Obstruction of Justice Against Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/11/2017,"Sunday on ABCs This Week, former U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York Preet Bharara, who was fired by President Donald Trump earlier this year, said he believed there was absolutely evidence to begin a case for obstruction of justice against Trump.  Partial transcript as follows: And our first guest is a former prosecutor whos worked with both Comey and Mueller, Preet Bharara, the U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York until March when he was fired by President Trump. Now hes a distinguished scholar at NYU. And this is his first television interview since the firing. Welcome to THIS WEEK. PREET BHARARA, FORMER U. S. ATTORNEY: Thank you, George. STEPHANOPOULOS: So I want to ask you about your encounters with President Trump later, but lets begin with that hearing. You were in the hearing room       BHARARA: I was. STEPHANOPOULOS:     on Thursday. We have a picture of you right behind James Comey right there. And youve heard the president since coming out and saying     claiming vindication from James Comey, essentially, though, saying that James Comey lied under oath. Did he? BHARARA: It doesnt appear that way. I mean youve got someone who has a reputation for probity, someone who has a reputation for telling the truth, someone who has contemporaneous notes of what happened in these meetings and in these conversations. On the other hand, I think a lot of people will tell you that the president himself sometimes makes accusations that turn out not to be true. I think he seems to have done that in a Tweet this morning. And when it comes down to whos telling the truth and whos not, I think most people would side reasonably with James Comey. STEPHANOPOULOS: You talked about the Tweets. The president did put out a Tweet this morning. I want to put it up on the screen right now. I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible. Totally illegal. Very cowardly.  Whats the lie there? BHARARA: Theres a     theres speculation and an accusation that there are other leaks and thats going to come out at some point in the future. I think there have been other accusations that are made in a haphazard and unsubstantiated way by the president, including that his office was tapped or wiretapped and no evidence of that has ever materialized. He suggested on at least one occasion that maybe he had recorded conversations, refuses to answer questions about whether or not that is true. But I think the point is that accusations made in the heat of the moment in 140 characters on Twitter, based on the track record and history, are not to be taken very seriously. STEPHANOPOULOS: His whole team is doubling down on this idea that the leak that James Comey admitted to could be illegal. Corey Lewandowski told me on Friday on GMA that its possible that he could be prosecuted for this. Anything illegal in that leak to The New York Times? BHARARA: Yes. So Im not in the business of making legal pronouncements on what is     whats legal or whats criminal anymore. But I will say, it sounds like more of a distraction. First of all, I think nothing that was in the memo or in the conversations that he had with his friend at Columbia Law School was classified. Second, I dont understand what the privilege argument is. You know, the presidents team fully was aware that the memo was going to be discussed, and the conversations were going to be discussed at the hearing and had the opportunity, when many reporters asked if they would invoke executive power to try to prevent some of that from being talked about and they declined that opportunity. So I think the main point that people should be focusing on, from what I can see, is that you have     you have uncontroverted from someone who was under oath that on at least one occasion, the president of the United States cleared a room of his vice president and his attorney general, and told his director of the FBI that he should essentially drop a case against his former national security adviser. And whether or not that is impeachable or thats indictable, thats a very serious thing. And Im not sure that people, you know, fully get that the standard is not just whether something is a crime or not, but there should     you know, whether or not it can be charged as a crime or Congress will impeach, its a very serious thing. And theres a lot to be frightened about and a lot to be outraged about if you have a president who, A, may have done it, although I know he denies it, but he hasnt done it under oath yet. And, B, he seems to suggest that even if he had done it or said words to that effect, theres nothing wrong with that. And you have other people who seem to be excusing it. Thats an incredibly serious thing if people think that the president of the United States can tell heads of law enforcement agencies, based on his own whim or his own personal preferences or friendships, that they should or should not pursue particular criminal cases against individuals. Thats not how America works. STEPHANOPOULOS: I want to dig into that more in a minute. But let me just stay on this leak for just a second. Even if the going to a friend at The New York Times wasnt illegal, was it a violation of FBI regulations, which would, in some cases, people say, require     before that revelation     getting advanced authorization from the FBI? BHARARA: Yes, you know, I dont know. It doesnt seem to be. You know, one could make the argument that it was not the best way to go about trying to bring this story into the open. I mean obviously, Jim Comey was comfortable, after being called to testify, to testify about the memos and about the conversations. And it was just his recollection. So, you know, I dont really see what the major issue is. It may be that there was a better way to bring the information out like he did in the hearing ultimately. STEPHANOPOULOS: One of the other things the presidents supporters have said is that James Comey, if he really thought something was wrong in that meeting you just referred to, that Oval Office meeting where everybody else was kicked out, he should have said no to the president right there, or he should have reported this evidence of a crime back to the FBI or the Justice Department. BHARARA: Yes, but the     but     as I understand it, he did say no. And the no that he said was that     to himself and to his people that we were not going to do what the president had asked. He wasnt going to drop the investigation. So I think, you know, he decided in his own mind he wasnt going to follow the direction of the president. And he says he took it as a direction and that was that. STEPHANOPOULOS: One other thing on James Comey. He talked about that encounter with Loretta Lynch and the email investigation. She wanted it described as a matter.  He wanted it described as an investigation. He said that made him queasy. Does that make you queasy, too? BHARARA: Well, it wasnt said to me. I think if youre     if its true and youre listening to it as a third party, its not the greatest instruction in the world. But if I could just say one other point on this issue of whether or not Donald Trump knew what he was doing, and I saw, I think, over the weekend, that Paul Ryan, who is, I think, in line to be president of the United States     hes in the succession line     has been trying to excuse this behavior     again, putting aside whether its obstruction or impeachable     that the president of the United States is new to this and hes new to protocols makes very, very little sense when the president became the president, in part, by campaigning at rally after rally after rally that I saw and Americans saw, on the issue of whether or not it was appropriate for the former attorney general, Loretta Lynch, to have a meeting on a tarmac with Bill Clinton. So he very well knew what the optics of that were and what the protocols were. And even though there is no evidence and no one has come forward to say anything untoward was discussed on that airplane at the tarmac, when an ongoing investigation was underway with respect to Hillary Clinton, he nevertheless said this is a reason why you should vote for me and not for that person. And for people to turn around and say now that there is evidence that the president of the United States himself had a private conversation, after kicking other high officials out of the room and told his FBI director confidentiality to do something about a criminal case thats pending, I think thats a big deal. And it cant be excused as simply being a novice or new. STEPHANOPOULOS: The presidents defenders, like Alan Dershowitz, say theres no grounds for obstruction. You talked about that. And he, in fact, says that presidents have the constitutional right to fire FBI directors and investigations as much as they want. One of the presidents attorneys, Jay Sekulow, is coming up next. He says theres no there there, no basis for obstruction. You are a former prosecutor. Is there evidence there that     to begin a case for obstruction? BHARARA: I think theres absolutely evidence to begin a case. I think its very important for all sorts of armchair speculators in the law to be clear that no one knows right now whether there is a provable case of obstruction. Its also true I think from based on what I see as a third party and out of government that theres no basis to say theres no obstruction. And this point on whether or not the president has legal authority to fire or to direct an investigation, I dont really get it. Its a little silly to me. The fact that you have authority to remove someone from office doesnt automatically immunize that act from criminal responsibility. And Ill give you an example of something from a different context. If it were to be true, and this is all made up for the sake of argument, if it were to be true that Michael Flynn offered a million dollars to Donald Trump and said Im going to give you this million dollars and Im giving it to you because I want you to fire Jim Comey and then Donald Trump fired Jim Comey, which everyone agrees he has the absolute authorization and authority to do, that would be an open and shut federal criminal case. Its a quid pro quo and he be could charged (inaudible) president of the United States. So this argument that you keep hearing on the TV shows that the mere fact that the president can fire an official at will doesnt solve the problem. STEPHANOPOULOS: In the end, though, as a prosecutor, what gets this beyond a he   said case? BHARARA: I dont know if theres other evidence. I mean, we are heard people talk abouttapes and theres a lot of cute game playing about whether or not there are tapes. That could prove it. But you have this in court all the time. And look at the surrounding circumstances and the indicia of truthfulness and those things include contemporaneous statements to other people. They include the track record of the witness. They include whether or not one of the hes in the he   said has a track record for lying or not both on the air and in legal proceedings like depositions, and I believe there is such a track record with respect to one of the parties. So you make your arguments as you can. And it may be the case, like Ive said, that no ultimate actual legal proceeding can be brought. I think people should keep an open mind about that. And Im the first to say it and the only people, and weve going to make that decision, are the team that Bob Mueller is assembling. STEPHANOPOULOS: So, are you pretty confident now that theres no question that President Trump will be investigating for obstruction by Bob Mueller? BHARARA: I dont know. Im not part of that team, but it seems     it seems reasonable that if Bob Mueller is looking at everything that you would expect him to look at, and good prosecutors look at everything. And this would seem to be one of those things that he was looking at. STEPHANOPOULOS: How far does the scope of a special prosecutor go in a situation like this? How far beyond the questions, the underlying collusion charges with Russia, the question of obstruction, is this something that could eventually get into the Trump Corporation businesses? Does the special counsel have that kind of leeway? BHARARA: I dont know where hell go. I think that Bob Mueller by reputation is     proceeds with caution and doesnt get over his skis ever, so I think hell have confidence that there will be a responsible investigation that goes where it needs to go and not beyond. STEPHANOPOULOS: And we heard the president say he wanted to testify, or willing to testify under oath. Any doubt that Bob Mueller would take him up on that. MUELLER: No, I think the way you do any kind of investigation that involves somebody who is a high official is you gather all the other evidence. We did investigations like this of high officials in New York State all the time. And what you do is you painfully and painstakingly gather evidence from as many witnesses as possible and documents and everything else and at the end of that typically, then, you interview the principal. STEPHANOPOULOS: You had several encounters with   Trump before you were fired by President Trump back in March starting at the     during the transition he invited to youTrump Tower, asked you to stay on as U. S. attorney. BHARARA: He did. STEPHANOPOULOS: And then he followed that up with two phone calls as  . BHARARA: He did. STEPHANOPOULOS: What happened in those phone calls? BHARARA: So theyre unusual phone calls and it sort of     when Ive been reading the stories of how the president has been contacting Jim Comey over time, felt a little bit like deja vu. And Im not the FBI director, but I was the chief federal law enforcement officer in Manhattan with jurisdiction over a lot of things including, you know, business interests and other things in New York. The number of times that President Obama called me in     years was zero. The number of types I would have been expected to be called by the president of the United States would be zero because there has to be some kind of arms length relationship given the jurisdiction that various people had. STEPHANOPOULOS: What did he say? BHARARA: So he called me in December, ostensibly just to shoot the breeze and asked me how I was doing and wanted to make sure I was OK. It was similar to what Jim Comey testified to with respect to a call he got when he was getting on the helicopter. I didnt say anything at the time to him. It was a little bit uncomfortable, but he was not the president, he was only the  . He called me again two days before the inauguration, again seemingly to check in and shoot the breeze and then he called me a third time when he     after he became president and I refused to return the call. STEPHANOPOULOS That you didnt take because he was president. But on those other phone calls, James Comey talked about the president trying to develop what he called a patronage relationship. Is that what you think was happening with you? BHARARA: Thats not the word I use. I was in discussions with my own folks, and in reporting the phone call to the chief of staff to the attorney general I said, it appeared to be that he was trying to cultivate some kind of relationship. And it may be hard for viewers of yours to understand if youre a layperson and not in the Justice Department, you know, whats wrong with that. The CEO of a company wants to call a field manager somewhere in the country because he thinks hes an    whats wrong with that? The problem is the Justice Department is different. And for the same reasons that Donald Trump emphasized how it looked when there was that tarmac incident and you had a private conversation between someone who had an interest in an investigation and the person who was responsible for, you know, advancing or ending that investigation, its a very weird and peculiar thing for a    conversation without the attorney general, without warning between the president and me or any United States attorney who has been asked to investigate various things and is in a position hypothetically to investigate business interests and associates of the president. STEPHANOPOULOS: Trump Corporation based in New York. BHARARA: Hypothetically there is the authority to investigate all sorts of interests relating to a president which is why there are strict guidelines in place about what can or cannot be talked about. Now Im not saying that he was going to ask me about a case, although there was some evidence in the record now that after a period of time, given the Jim Comey testimony, theres some evidence that Donald Trump didnt think anything of asking a high level law enforcement official to take a particular action that he wanted for himself on a criminal case. STEPHANOPOULOS: And then when you were actual     when he was actually president, you refused to take the call, and I guess the next day you were fired. BHARARA: So the call came in. I got a message. We deliberated over it, thought it was inappropriate to return the call. And 22 hours later I was asked to resign along with 45 other people. STEPHANOPOULOS: And some Democrats, notably Elizabeth Warren, connecting that to the fact that you did have jurisdiction over Trump Tower. Do you think theres any connection? BHARARA: Im not drawing the connection. Ive lived long enough to know that anything is possible and were seeing a lot of things going on now with respect to accusations that Jim Comey made under oath in a congressional hearing. So I dont know. To this day I have no idea why I was fired. You know, it doesnt bother me. Im living a great good life, and very happily. But I have no idea.

Report: John McCain Claims Barack Obama Provided Better American Leadership Than Donald Trump,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/11/2017,"Sen. John McCain ( ) has reportedly told a   newspaper that he believes American leadership was better under President Barack Obama than President Trump     the latest in a series of shots the failed 2008 presidential candidate has taken at his fellow Republican. [According to the Guardian, McCain was visibly irked when asked about comments Trump made last week in the wake of the terrorist attack in London, in which he criticized London Mayor Sadiq Khan for his response to the atrocity.  What do you think the message is? The message is that America doesnt want to lead, McCain said. They are not sure of American leadership, whether it be in Siberia or whether it be in Antarctica.  Then, when asked if Americas international standing was better under Obama, McCain reportedly responded: As far as American leadership is concerned, yes.  McCain     who lost his 2008 presidential bid against   Obama after a campaign in which he repeatedly defended Obama from his supporters criticisms     has been an outspoken critic of Trump and has refused to tone it down since his fellow Republican took the White House. In a recent tour of Australia, McCain told an audience in Sydney that Trump has unsettled allies and Americans alike. Other American allies have similar doubts these days and this is understandable, McCain said, according to The Associated Press at the citys university. I realize that some of President Trumps actions and statements have unsettled Americas friends. They have unsettled many Americans as well.  He went on to urge the Australians to keep at the   Partnership deal in the hope that one day America will decide to join you.  He also said in an interview with an Australian TV network that Trump makes him nervous from time to time and said he was bothered that Trump does not always take the advice of his national security team. Can I tell you that he does all the time? No. Does it bother me? Yes, it bothers me, he said. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

Trump Walk of Fame Star Vandalized During L.A. Gay Pride Resist March,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/11/2017,"President Donald Trumps star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame was vandalized yet again Sunday morning during the Los Angeles Gay Pride and Resist March. [Trumps star     which has been vandalized several times since the beginning of his presidential run     was photographed Sunday morning covered in stickers bearing slogans including Resist Homophobia and No! Drive out   fascist regime!   Sundays defacement of Trumps star was far more mild than previous vandalism. In October, Los Angeles man James Otis completely destroyed the star when he repeatedly struck it with a   in a   incident that was captured on film by Deadline. Otis struck a plea deal with prosecutors in February that saw him avoid jail time in exchange for paying $4, 400 to the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce and the Hollywood Historic Trust. The star     which Trump was honored with in 2007 for his work producing the Miss Universe pageant and for his hit NBC reality television show The Apprentice     has previously been covered in swastikas and vulgar language. In May, an unidentified person placed a golden toilet at the site of the star, with a message scrawled atop the toilet tank that read, Take a Trump! The site of Trumps star has become a rallying point for both   and   forces in the wake of Trumps election. Trump supporters previously gathered at the star to celebrate the Republican businessmans victory over Hillary Clinton in November. Sundays annual Gay Pride march in Hollywood was renamed the #ResistMarch this year as organizers incorporated opposition to the president into the demonstrations messaging. Marchers held signs denouncing the president as attendees heard speeches from elected officials including Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garretti, Rep. Ted Lieu, and City Council member Mitch OFarrell.

Donald Trump Ridicules Cowardly Leaker James Comey,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/11/2017,"President Donald Trump continued to cast doubt on the Senate testimony from his former FBI director James Comey, suggesting that his reliance on leaks to the media was longstanding. [I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible, Trump wrote on Twitter on Sunday.  He questioned whether Comeys decision to leak details of his conversation with the president was illegal and cited the FBI directors own testimony by calling him very cowardly.  During the testimony, Comey was asked by Sen. Dianne Feinstein why he told the president that would see what we could do when he asked the FBI director to help lift the cloud of the Russian investigation off of his administration. Well, it was kind of a slightly cowardly way of trying to avoid telling him, were not going to do that     that I would see what we could do, Comey replied. It was a way of kind of getting off the phone, frankly.  Feinstein also asked Comey why he didnt challenge the president defending his former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, when he believed that Trump was urging him to drop the investigation. Maybe if I were stronger, I would have, Comey said. I was so stunned by the conversation that I just took it in."
Report: President Trump Gives Priebus Independence Day Deadline to Fix White House Mess or Be Replaced with Fresh Blood - Breitbart,Breitbart,Matthew Boyle,6/11/2017,"Politico is reporting late Sunday that White House chief of staff Reince Priebus has an Independence Day deadline to clean up the messes he is responsible for in the White House. [President Donald Trump has set a deadline of July 4 for a shakeup of the White House that could include removing Reince Priebus as his chief of staff, according to two administration officials and three outside advisers familiar with the matter, Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote late Sunday night:  While Trump has set deadlines for staff changes before, only to let them pass without pulling the trigger, the president is under more scrutiny than ever regarding the sprawling Russia investigation, which is intensifying the pressure on his White House team. Days after his return from his first foreign trip late last month, Trump berated Priebus in the Oval Office in front of his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski and deputy campaign manager David Bossie for the dysfunction in the White House, according to multiple sources familiar with the conversation. Palmeri joined Breitbart News Sunday on SiriusXM Patriot Channel 125 to discuss the breaking news on Priebus out of the White House. Palmeri wrote that Bossie has been considered for deputy White House chief of staff and Lewandowski has been considered for a White House senior adviser role with a portfolio that includes Russia, but Trump told Lewandowski and Bossie they would not be going into the White House just yet     that Priebus deserves one last chance to get things under control in there. Im giving you until July 4, Trump told Priebus, Palmeri wrote, citing a source with knowledge of the conversation. I dont want them [Lewandowski and Bossie] to come into this mess. If Im going to clean house, they will come in as fresh blood.  White House press secretary Sean Spicer     a staunch ally of Priebus     denied this claim. Whoever is saying that is either a liar or out of the loop, Spicer told Palmeri. But Spicer has previously been wrong about Palmeri. Back in March, Spicer told Breitbart News that Palmeri was an idiot with no real sources when she previously reported accurately that Priebus was in jeopardy of losing his job then. It turns out that is not accurate as, the very next day, Palmeri quoted an   conversation she had with chief White House strategist Stephen K. Bannon. Palmeri added that Independence Day is hardly the first deadline that Priebus has faced     and he has succeeded in surviving for now. The Independence Day timeframe is timed with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnells deadline for passage of the health care bill through the chamber, which is also the start of the July 4th recess, she wrote: Priebus took the brunt of the blame for the first failure to get a vote on the bill through the House, though the White House and Speaker Paul Ryan were ultimately able to secure its passage on a second try. Talk of Trumps July 4th deadline has made the rounds in the White House, but insiders and those close to the president are not holding their breath, given the perpetual talk that Priebus and other senior staffers are on the way out. Trumps first deadline for the firing of Priebus and many staffers that he brought on from the Republican National Committee was the   mark. The president then considered the idea of a Memorial Day shakeup when he returned from the foreign trip, and then most recently, July 4. People who have been considered as potential upgrades from Priebus, Palmeri wrote, include   campaign adviser David Urban and Blackstone executive Wayne Berman     among others who have been considered. Other names that have been floated publicly but are not mentioned in this piece include House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy and White House National Economic Council director Gary Cohn. McCarthys role in Congress, since Congress has not done much in the way of helping Trump succeed, could be an impediment to him getting the job. Cohns leftist tendencies, meanwhile     as exhibited by his comments bashing the coal industry while in Europe last month     are a sign that the selection of Cohn would be a setback to the administration. Cohn is reportedly interested in other positions, too, including Federal Reserve chairman. An adviser to the president mocked Priebuss predicament in a statement to Palmeri. Its become comical that every holiday becomes a referendum on Reince, the adviser said. Priebus has even joked about how bad his situation is, per Palmeri, telling one person recently, Ive got one foot on a banana peel and another out the door.  Now, Trump is considering sending him to Greece as ambassador. Trump has weighed the idea of moving Priebus to the role of ambassador to Greece, because of his Greek descent, Palmeri wrote. Trump told Bossie, that Priebus will enjoy Greece, according to two people with knowledge of the comment.  But at least two   advisers questioned    whether Priebus was indeed on his way out on July 4 if he does not fix the place soon. The White House is different [than the Trump Organization],   Sam Nunberg said. You cant make quick changes, its an institution. Once someone is gone from there, theyre gone. With that said, I think Reince will be there for the long haul.  Roger Stone, another longtime confidante of the president, told Palmeri that two drastic personnel decisions that Trump made in his business career were when he fired Trump Organization CEO Edward Tracy and Trump Atlantic City Associates CEO Nicholas Ribis. He likened the firings to Richard Nixons Saturday Night Massacre and called it sudden, Palmeri wrote of her conversation with Stone. He suggested that if and when Trump removes Priebus, it will be at an opportune time and with a landing pad.  Stone told Palmeri, too, that after the fallout from the presidents firing of now former FBI director James Comey, he will likely remove Priebus more carefully if he does end up doing so. I think it would be fair to say, that with the entire Comey controversy, thats a pretty good reason not to make a change at this exact moment, Stone said.

Police Discover Mans Severed Head on Homes Front Porch - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/11/2017,"Police discovered a mans severed head on the front porch of a home in Jackson, Mississippi Saturday morning.

"Amazon Selling Free Palestine Shirts After Sears, Walmart Stop Selling Them - Breitbart",Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/11/2017,"Online retailer Amazon is still selling shirts as well as other items of clothing that say Free Palestine after Sears and Walmart have removed them from their stores. [Amazon is selling the items, including hats, shirts, and pins featuring clenched fists and the Palestinian flag, via   sellers, the Times of Israel reported.  Most of the Free Palestine items in Amazons marketplace have been getting   ratings from consumers unhappy with how Amazon is willing to host a   retailer that sells   propaganda. Why would you sell free Palestine merchandise? it presupposes the nonexistence of Israel and ultimately the nialiation of the Jewish nation, one user wrote in a review of a Free Palestine!

Spreadshirt Collection, the     company that sold the items, featured merchandise ranging from tank tops to   that had   messages.

GOP House Majority Whip Scalise on Forgoing August Recess: We Are Just Going to Stay in and Get It Done - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/11/2017,"On Sundays broadcast of Fox News Channels Sunday Morning Futures, host Maria Bartiromo confronted House Majority Whip Rep. Steve Scalise ( ) about the approaching deadline for Congress to pass legislation on health care and tax reform.  Bartiromo asked Scalise about the possibility of Congress forgoing its August recess to get those bills through.

SHOCK POLL: Pro-Trump Corey Stewart Takes Lead in VA Governor GOP Primary - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/11/2017,"On Sunday, polling firm Change Research placed outsider Republican candidate for Virginia Governor Corey Stewart ahead of establishment rivals Ed Gillespie and Frank Wagner among likely voters in Tuesdays GOP primary. [The survey of 3, 232 Virginians shows a slim lead for Stewart among likely primary voters. The tally among those who will definitely vote for a given candidate, however, is more striking, with a   lead for Stewart at 28 percent over 19 percent and 9 percent for Gillespie and Wagner respectively.  Corey Stewart, President Donald Trumps former Virginia campaign manager, has carved out a niche for himself as the populist challenger to   GOP operative and 2014 U. S. Senate candidate Gillespie. In addition to making the fight against illegal immigration a centerpiece of his campaign, Stewart made headlines with his pledge to defend against the removal of any of Virginias   monuments to the states Confederate Civil War heroes by   agitators. Earlier polling had Stewart down significantly to his more   rivals who have been reluctant to wholeheartedly line up with the   populist base on issues like immigration. The poll has   former U. S. Congressman Tom Perriello up eight points in the Democratic primary for the same office. Perriello has hit Stewart hard for his populist stances, calling them an ignorant,   view of Virginia and calling the fact that thousands of Virginians fought for the Confederacy our greatest sin.  Change Research is a new polling outfit run by two   data scientists and  a longtime political and communications leader.  The same firm forecasted the final result in the Montana House special election victory of Greg Gianforte within one point of the actual result. They also released the analysis that showed how little of an effect the   altercation between Gianforte and Guardian journalist Ben Jacobs, who alleged the candidate   him as he tried to ask a question, had on voters intentions."
Trumps air-travel revolution could make flying more expensive,Business Insider,Benjamin Zhang,6/11/2017,"On Monday, .     Were proposing reduced wait times, increased route efficiency,   and far fewer delays, the president said. Our plan will get you   where you need to go quickly, more reliably, more affordably,   and, yes, for the first time in a long time, on time.     In fact, the president went as far as calling it an     revolution.     The White House plan will use the Aviation Innovation, Reform,   and Reauthorization Act ( introduced in 2016 by   the Republication Congressman Bill Schuster as its foundation.     The centerpiece of the AIRR calls for control of the countrys     network to be transferred from the Federal Aviation   Administration to one or more    private entities.     The privatization of Americas    network has   long been a   issue. The White House argues that its   plan would allow the FAA to focus on aviation safety while   freeing the   process from the burden of bureaucracy.     Privatization is expected to be achieved through the use of    a   business arrangement in   which the public and private sectors cooperate to deliver a   service or infrastructure project.     The advantages of a P3 are twofold. First, proponents say they   can reduce the cost of a project by streamlining bureaucracy.   Second, P3s are more effective in that they contract specialists   whose expertise is focused on a particular subject area.        In addition, the cost of the modernization project is expected to   be shouldered by fees generated from the parties that use the ATC   system.     Privatizations biggest proponents are the countrys major   airlines represented by the trade organization Airlines For   America (A4A). In a statement, the group called Trumps   announcement bold leadership in prioritizing the modernization   of our nations air traffic control (ATC) infrastructure.     This is a really important issue for the entire country,   Hawaiian Airlines Chief Commercial Officer Peter Ingram told   Business Insider.     If you look at service between the Eastern US and the West   Coast, flight times today are much longer than they were 20 or 30   years ago, and its not because the airplanes are moving slower       its because we confine ourselves to a fraction of the available   airspace because we simply dont have the ATC infrastructure to   be able to support taking full advantage of that.     In addition, Hawaiian, a member of A4A, and other carriers are   limited to a handful of lanes across the Pacific, which often   results in less efficient routing that causes more pollution and   higher costs, Ingram said.     According to A4A     which includes American, United, JetBlue,   Alaska, and Southwest Airlines     antiquated     technology has contributed to delays that cost the economy as   much as $25 billion last year. As a result, the airlines are   standing behind the presidents promises to expedite the   modernization of the countrys ATC systems by updating     technology through privatization.        Its not for lack of technology or lack of will to get   [modernization] done, Ingram said. We, fundamentally, as an   industry believe that in the confines of the annual government   budgetary system, we are not going to be able to make the   necessary investment to fix the system even if there is the will   to spend the money.     Opponents of the plan believe the privatization of the countrys   ATC systems is fraught with risk and negative side effects.     The Alliance for Aviation Across America argues that   privatization would hurt the nations smaller communities. In   fact, the organization     which represents private operators,   small business, and small airports     called Trumps plan a power   grab by the nations big airlines.     We have 5, 000 airports around the country of which 3, 000 are     airports, but the majority of the commercial traffic,   about 70% goes through roughly 30 airports, Selena Shilad, the   alliances executive director, told Business Insider.     So there are a lot of communities who are served by smaller   airports or by municipal airports where the airlines will have no   incentive to concentrate their resources.     According to Shilad, the airlines have long sought control of the   ATC network to funnel resources to the markets that they care   about the most. The alliance believes that the      system supported by A4A would be detrimental to the smaller   operators that dot the American landscape.     Our infrastructure that connects large and small communities   alike are crucial parts of the economy and access for communities   of all sizes is an important part of keeping that economic engine   going, Shilad said.     At least one major airline agrees with Shilad.     In a 2016 report,  and a former A4A member,   lends credence to the alliances concerns.     The current FAA system helps support equal service at both large   urban airports and smaller rural ones, but privatization could   cause smaller airports to limit service or shut down, the Delta   report said. As a result, rural residents could be forced to   drive to urban areas to access the same airline service they   currently enjoy close to home.     In addition, Delta questions whether it is prudent to privatize   ATC when the   system has evolved into the worlds   largest networks     and one of its safest.        The   airline also questions whether privatization   would lead to lower costs. According to the report, ATC fees   in Canada and the UK increased 59% and 30% after the countries   privatized their respective ATC systems.     During that same period, ATC fees in the US increased just 6%.   The Delta report concludes that operational costs in the US will   increase by 20% to 29% during the first 10 years of a privatized   ATC network.     As for the Trump administrations plan, the airline wrote in a   statement to Business Insider:     As the debate over ATC privatization rages on, it should be noted   that a modernized ATC system is not the silver bullet some make   it out to be. It will not cure all that ails Americas aviation   network.     Even the most sophisticated ATC system is not going to solve the   chronic delay problem that plagues much of the country,  wrote in a blog post. The   problem wont be solved until two things happen: First, airlines   need to be better rationalize their schedules and, second, we   need more runways and larger,   airports.     Hawaiians Ingram agrees.     I think [ATC and airport infrastructure] are both big issues,   he said. There are airports throughout the US where the   infrastructure is no longer adequate or we could use more   capacity because things are very constrained.     Regardless of what happens, the fact that there is an open   acknowledgment that Americas    system and   aviation infrastructure are in dire need of improvement is a   step in the right direction.  President Trump has proposed a plan to. .."
Why billionaire Steve Ballmer spent $10 million to build a free  and strangely patriotic  website,Business Insider,Julie Bort,6/11/2017,"Its been said were living in  where people choose to ignore facts or believe lies that challenge their own worldview. Steve Ballmer, the billionaire former CEO of Microsoft and current NBA Clippers team owner, isnt buying it. Thats why he wrote $10 million worth of personal checks to create a free website called USAFacts. org,  The site takes government data from 70 different government sources to create a financial report on the government. It makes it easy to find out everything, from how much taxes we all really pay to crime and divorce rates. Ballmer says the idea for the site has nothing to do with one political party or another, but everything to do with state of politics in general. Its not a political site, but I hope it plays a role, he told Business Insider. I am partisan for facts themselves.  He says todays political environment feels like a sports event, where everyone is rooting for their own team and against the other team     and thats inherently dangerous. A sports game is easy. Somebody wins, somebody loses, and thats OK. But thats not how it should be in this country, he says. In politics, unlike sports, everybody needs to arrive at a common conclusion and we all live with the conclusion.  In other words, the same laws govern us all, no matter which team championed it. And theres a reason to hope that Ballmer is onto to something and people still do care deeply about facts, even if we all have different opinions about what to do about them. When the site officially launched in April, Ballmer didnt know what the response would be, if anyone would care. But the day it launched, the site was so overwhelmed with traffic that the traffic crashed the site for hours. In its first 48 hours, USAFacts. org chalked up more than half a million visitors and 2 million page views. He even got fan letters from people with suggestions on how to better calculate divorce rates or from those who found some typos.

"Gohmert: Obama DOJ, Not the Russians, Tried to Influence Presidential Election - Breitbart",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/11/2017,"In an appearance on Fox News Channels Americas News HQ on Sunday, Rep. Louis Gohmert ( ) said that if anyone interfered with the 2016 presidential election, it wasnt the Russians but the Department of Justice.  He specifically named former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and former FBI Director James Comey. Gohmert referred to Comeys testimony last week before the Senate Intelligence Committee where he said Lynch had told him to refer to the FBIs investigation into Hillary Clintons mishandling of classified information as a matter, rather than an investigation, even though Clinton was under investigation. Comey said that led him to publicly announce the end of the Clinton investigation in July 2016. At best, it was an attempt to manipulate the election, not by the Russians in this case, but by the Department of Justice     the Attorney General herself     because that came from Comey,  Gohmert said. [Comey] totally ruined his own credibility     or what was left of it, Gohmert said. He did vast damage and raised big red flags and questions over Loretta Lynchs job as head of the Justice Department. [Lynch] was using her official position to help the campaign of Hillary Clinton and that didnt seem to bother him enough to do a memo, Gohmert said. Gohmert said this should be the subject of a congressional investigation. We need to round up all those people [Comey] talked to     because we have a conspiracy remaining afoot in the Department of Justice that is going to be out to destroy this president and theyve got to be fired if not worse.

Cuban Immigrant Behind Deadly Rampage in Texas,Breitbart,Ildefonso Ortiz,6/11/2017,"BROWNSVILLE, Texas     Authorities identified a Cuban immigrant with a long arrest history as the man who violently shanked a corrections officer in the neck. The man then stole the guards weapons, murdered an innocent man, and engaged police in a short but fierce gun battle that led to his death. [As Breitbart Texas reported,    Miguel Diaz Garcia, escaped from authorities by using a makeshift shank to stab a Cameron County Sheriffs detention officer in the neck during a doctors visit. The inmate swam through a   lake to a nearby home and murdered the homeowner in order to steal his vehicle. The rampage ended in a deadly shootout with law enforcement in the nearby city of San Benito.   Brownsville Police Chief Orlando Rodriguez revealed that Diaz Garcia is not a stranger to law enforcement. He has a long criminal history that included multiple violent offenses including aggravated assault and terroristic threats. According to Cameron County jail records, Diaz had spent close to 500 days in custody in connection with an arrest on home burglary charges from a Brownsville case. Cameron County Sheriff Omar Lucio revealed to Breitbart Texas that Diaz Garcia is a Cuban immigrant who also had an immigration detainer from U. S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement.  Prior to his escape, Diaz created a makeshift knife by using a toothbrush and attaching a disposable razor blade to the tip, Lucio said. The inmate was being transported to a dental office by one guard. Sheriffs policy calls for two guards to escort an inmate, but an apparent shortage of staff led to the decision to move the inmate with only one guard.  We still dont know how but he was able to remove his restraints and when the guard opened the door, he charged at him using the shank to help overpower him, Lucio said.  Weighing approximately 240 pounds and standing at more than 6 feet tall, Diazs size was a factor that helped him during the attack on the detention officer, said Brownsville Police Chief Orlando Rodriguez. After severely injuring the guard, Diaz stole the lawmans duty belt and his service issued Glock 22, . 40 caliber handgun.  The man jumped into a nearby manmade lake and swam across to a nearby home. There, the man demanded the keys to a small sedan, The owner tried to calm down the agitated fugitive. Rather than listen, Diaz opened fire, fatally shooting the    Mario Martinez in front of his family.  After the shooting, Diaz drove off in the familys vehicle until authorities spotted him. A   chase ensued ending in the nearby city of San Benito. Diaz reportedly fired multiple rounds at authorities who returned fire, fatally wounding the escaped criminal. He was on a rampage, thankfully there are men and women in uniform who are willing to run into danger and this matter was ended without further loss of life.  Rodriguez said.

The President dropped in at about 10:30 p. m. ET, hours into the reception, which was being held at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster Township, New Jersey, according to someone who was in the room.  Guests were unaware that Trump, who stayed at the club this weekend, was stopping by until Secret Service agents came into the room minutes before his arrival to clear the way and make sure guests wouldnt surround him, the source said. Once he was there, Trump asked the names of the bride and groom and posed for photos. The source said the President also signed some Make America Great Again hats and gave them to guests, some of whom cheered him and chanted U. S. A. ! The White House has been largely silent about the Presidents weekend activities in Bedminster.

Police: North Carolina Teacher Accused of Sexual Relations with 3 Students,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/11/2017,"A teacher at a North Carolina charter school has been arrested and charged with allegedly having improper sexual relationships with three students. [On June 8, the Rocky Mount Police arrested math teacher Erin Elizabeth McAuliffe, 25, and charged her with the molestation of three boys, two    and one who was 16, according to police reports.  Officers said in a statement that McAuliffe was charged with three counts of sexual activity with a student and one count of indecent liberties with a minor. The investigation began after school administrators contacted authorities upon hearing rumors of the teachers activities. The information from the school was related to a math teacher having inappropriate sexually related contact with three juvenile male students off campus, a police department spokesman said. In its own statement, Rocky Mount Preparatory said, We have been fully cooperative with local law enforcement during the course of their handling of this matter.  The head of the public charter school, Todd Pipkin, told the media that McAuliffes last day was May 4 and school is out for the summer. McAuliffe only worked at the school for a single year. The suspect taught as a math teacher but had only tutored students previous to her job at Rocky Mount Preparatory. The former teacher was booked into the Carteret County jail under a $20, 000 bond. After bonding out of jail, McAuliffe is next scheduled to appear in Nash County District Court June 12. If convicted, she could be sentenced to up to five years in jail for the charge of taking indecent liberties with a minor, a Class F felony.

Kansas City Man Freed After 17 Years in Prison When His Doppelganger Is Found,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/11/2017,"A Kansas City man was released after serving 17 years in jail for a robbery he didnt commit when a man, who looked so much like him they could be twins, was finally discovered and brought to the courts attention. [Richard Anthony Jones was convicted of a Roeland Park robbery committed in 1999, but since the first day he was arrested, Jones claimed he was innocent of the crime. While serving time in prison, he began hearing from other prisoners that he bore a striking resemblance to another known criminal.  After years of pleading his case, Jones, who was convicted solely on eyewitness testimony, finally received help from the Innocence Project who believed him enough to begin looking into the claim of a doppelganger who may have been the real culprit, the Kansas City Star reported. Joness lawyers investigated the prisoners story and believed they found the man everyone said looked so much like their client that they could pass as the same person. We were floored by how much they looked alike, said Joness attorney Alice Craig of seeing the other man who some believe committed the crime instead of Jones. The legal team then contacted the victim from the robbery to look at photos of the two men   . Photos of the two men show each with braided hair and a   goatee. The two look so similar that they could easily be mistaken as two photos of the same man. The victim agreed that she could not tell the two men apart and could now not be sure of her    testimony. Jones was arrested in 1999 after the victim picked him out of a police photo database. But Joness lawyers maintain that the police acted in a highly suggestive manner because Jones was the only suspect in the photo group shown to the victim who looked anything like the description the victim gave. Ultimately, Johnson County District Judge Kevin Moriarty ordered Joness release based on the new evidence. Further investigation revealed that the other man, known as Ricky, also lived very near the victim in 1999. The now released man was said to be angry for years about his incarceration, but when he looked at the photo of his doppelganger, even he had to admit that it was an easy mistake to make. Jones told the media he was happy to be with his children at long last. When it comes to my kids, its been a rough ride, but they are now at an age where they can understand, he said.

After the deputy told Humphries that medical personnel was coming to check him out and asked him if he was going to give them a hard time, there was mumbling and then a loud yell followed by several loud thuds, according to the video. Humphries allegedly kicked the rear passenger door and pulled on the metal cage.  Police estimate the vehicle suffered $1, 000 in damage. Deputies took him to Marion County Jail and charged him with two counts of criminal mischief, one of them a felony count for property damage of $1, 000 or more and the other a misdemeanor. The Florida Highway Patrol, which was investigating the crash Humphries was involved in, reports that witnesses say Humphries tried to open the door and pulled off the handle of a parked car at the Marion County Sheriffs   Office. He also allegedly urinated on the vehicle after he discovered he could not get in. The Miami Herald reports that the estimated damage to the other vehicle was about $700. The Florida Highway Patrol is investigating the crash separately from the charges, the sheriffs office said."
London: Fake explosive belts photos released,CNN,Faith Karimi,6/11/2017,"(CNN) The London Bridge attackers wore fake explosive belts that had water bottles wrapped in silver tape, and may have planned to create a siege situation during their terror rampage, authorities said.  Photos released by police on Saturday show   belts linked to disposable water bottles covered in tape.  I have not seen this tactic in the UK before    where terrorists create maximum fear by strapping fake explosives to themselves, said Cmdr. Dean Haydon of the Metropolitan Police, whos leading the investigation.  The three men rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge on June 3 before going on a stabbing rampage at bars at nearby Borough Market. By the time the carnage was over, eight people were dead.  The attackers, identified as Khuram Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba, were fatally shot by police. The belts were still attached to the men when they were killed, Metropolitan Police said.  fake belts looked real, The fake explosive belts were visible during the attacks, Haydon said, and may have looked real to those who saw them.  It could be that they had plans to take the attack in to a siege situation or it might be that they saw it as protection from being shot themselves, he said in a statement.   It makes the bravery of those police officers and members of the public who tackled the terrorists even more remarkable. Plans for bigger truck  Details emerging since the attack point to plans for a   assault. British police said Saturday that Butt, the ringleader, tried to rent a 7.  truck online on the morning of June 3,  but did not provide payment details when prompted. He rented a different van later that evening. Large trucks have been used in past ramming attacks in Europe and have caused higher numbers of casualties. One attacker killed 86 people in France when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, another one rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12.  At the time of the London attacks, Butt was out on bail in a fraud case dating to October last year. He had not been charged in that case due to insufficient evidence, police said.  Two British counterterrorism sources told CNN that the arrest was part of an effort by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists off the streets by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism.  Ceramic knives, van carrying explosives, In addition to the fake explosives, police have released images of ceramic knives found on or near the assailants and the van they used to hit people on the bridge. Three   pink ceramic kitchen knives were found with tape around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers wrists. Inside the van, police found two blowtorches as well as what appeared to be 13 Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid. The van also had office chairs and a suitcase. Police believe the attackers told relatives they were using it to move.  Arrests continue, On Sunday evening, a   old man in east London was arrested in connection with the terror attack, Londons Metropolitan Police said. The man was apprehended in Barking on suspicion of being concerned in the commission, preparation or instigation of acts of terrorism, the statement said. Six other men remain in custody, Metropolitan Police said."
Trump holds fundraiser for lawmaker who helped save GOP health care bill,CNN,Ashley Killough,6/11/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump headlined a fundraiser Sunday for a moderate Republican congressman who found himself at the crux of the health care debate this spring. Rep. Tom MacArthurs   campaign hosted a reception at Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey, where the President spent the weekend. It was a great event with about 100 guests and the congressman raised more than $800, 000, said Chris Russell, a spokesman for MacArthurs campaign. The theme of his remarks were about making tough decisions and solving problems. He didnt run for Congress to decorate a chair. Obamacare is failing, premiums are rising and choices are dwindling. Tom decided sitting on the sidelines and letting it completely collapse was not an option.  MacArthur, whos in his second term, represents New Jerseys third congressional district. He resigned as   of the caucus of Republican moderates known as the Tuesday Group last month because of divisions within the group over the embattled GOP health care plan. In April, MacArthur proposed an amendment to the plan in order to get conservatives on board. The amendment would allow states to seek waivers to opt out of certain Obamacare requirements, including those that protect those with   conditions. With that, enough Republicans voted to pass the bill, and now the Senate is working on its own version. MacArthur faced angry protests at a marathon town hall meeting last month in New Jersey, where he took questions from constituents for more than four hours. Tickets to Sundays fundraiser are $5, 400 per couple, according to the invitation. Attendees can contribute $25, 000 or help raise $100, 000 to get a photo with the President."
Source: Sessions plans to testify surprised Senate intelligence panel members,CNN,Manu Raju,6/11/2017,"(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions letter on Saturday offering to testify before the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday caught members of the panel by surprise, and senators are concerned hes trying to avoid testifying publicly, a source familiar with the situation says. The committee has not confirmed the Tuesday date for Sessions testimony and are still discussing whether to allow him to testify in open or closed session, or both, as former FBI Director James Comey did last week. A number of members are concerned Sessions may be attempting to avoid testifying in public by scrapping his previously scheduled Senate and House Appropriations appearances this week, where he was expected to be grilled on issues related to the federal investigation into Russias efforts to influence the US election, several sources say. Sen. Mark Warner of Virginia, the vice chairman of the panel, is among those concerned, a source says. Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon, also a member of the intelligence panel, sent a letter to panel Chairman Richard Burr of North Carolina and Warner asking for the hearing to be open. A Justice Department official told CNN on Sunday that department officials expected the hearing would be closed but said the final decision was up to the Senate committee."
The mysterious death of Marine Col. Stahlman,CNN,Deborah Feyerick,6/11/2017,"(CNN) A decade ago, US Marine Col. Michael Stahlman was serving in Iraq when he was found in his bed, mortally wounded with a gunshot wound to his left temple. Stahlman was evacuated by air for emergency treatment, and later moved to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center outside  where he died two months later.  The military medical examiner ruled the    colonels death a suicide.   But CNNs Deborah Feyerick reports that when his wife, Kim Stahlman, received the news that her husband was found with a   gunshot wound to his left temple, the first thing she thought was, Hes not  . When he died in 2008, Stahlman was one of the   officers to die in the Iraq war. He was a senior Marine lawyer working in the Anbar province with a unit tasked with rebuilding the   countrys police and court system.  The area was rife with corruption, and contractors, Iraqi officials and others were getting rich. Part of Stahlmans job was to conduct criminal investigations in corruption cases involving American soldiers and contractors. Nine years after her husbands death, Kim Stahlman is still fighting to change the narrative of how his life ended.  With the help of a retired military lawyer and a Navy investigator, Kim Stahlman says she has documents that prove critical pieces of evidence were overlooked in what she says was a rush to judgment by the Naval Criminal  Investigative Service and the Marines. The Armed Forces Medical Examiner System told CNN that it has not received or has been made aware of any new information that would warrant the office to reconsider any conclusions previously supplied to the family and investigators. Likewise, the NCIS stands by its investigation, and says a new probe would exploit the emotions of a grieving widow and dishonor the service and memory of Col. Stahlman. But Kim Stahlman says thats exactly what theyve done by failing to reopen her husbands case. Watch Deborah Feyericks CNN report."
"Jock, nerd, or class president  how popular you were in high school still affects you today",Business Insider,Richard Feloni,6/10/2017,"Youre an adult now, you may think, and the number of parties you   were or were not invited to when you were 16 is meaningless.     But youd be wrong, according to Dr. Mitch Prinstein, one of the   worlds foremost researchers on the psychology of popularity.     We spoke with Prinstein about his new book, ,   and  adapted from the one he teaches at the   University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.     I believe that what we know is that peoples status may change;   their internal experience does not, Prinstein told Business   Insider. The research shows that the ways that our brains are   built and developed, we really pull on those old adolescent   memories far more often than we realize. Even when were   processing things in current day.     Bear in mind that : social reputation   (status) and social preference (likability). You can have one   without the other, but youre better served by having both     and   your level of each influences your life far beyond high school.     Check out how your place in the high school ecosystem is likely   affecting you today.    High status   Low likability     The idea of peaking in high school feels intuitive when we go   to high school reunions and find that the years havent been kind   to some, but theres research that suggests its a real   phenomenon for those who had high status but low likability.     There is some evidence to suggest that 10 years later, 20 years   later, they are having some more difficulties with relationships,   those that were high in status in adolescence, Prinstein said.   They are having more difficulties with addictions     not in every   case, obviously, but far more so than those who may not have been   as popular.     For example, those that fit into the popular jock and mean girl   archetypes of American culture tend to demonstrate aggression and   displays of dominance on their peers, and when they leave the   context of high school, they struggle to create meaningful,   fulfilling relationships, which then leads to lowered  .    Low status   High likability     High intelligence in adolescence does not, of course, guarantee   low status, but the kids who outwardly express their fascination   with academics and niche subjects tend to be labeled nerds, and   usually arent spotted at the lunch tables among     athletes.     But, if these   teenagers happen to have some degree of   interpersonal skills that allows them to build relationships,   they shouldnt worry.     In fact, Prinstein told us, these charming geeks have a good   chance of achieving success as adults, because the same high   intelligence that got them shunned as adolescents becomes   rewarded in a collegiate and then professional setting, and their   likability makes people want to help them.    High status   High likability     If a teenager is lucky enough to achieve both high status and   high likability, then they have a solid foundation for their   adult life.     Prinstein noted that likability is far more important than status   when it comes to potential for success and   happiness. Pursuing status at the expense of likability   is typically harmful, but that doesnt mean high status or the   pursuit of it are inherently bad things.    Low status   Low likability     The kids who had the toughest time in school unfortunately tend   to have the toughest time as adults, too.        As noted above, those who were low in status but had the capacity   to build relationships can do quite well in life, but the   teenagers who are total social outcasts enter adulthood with a   shaky foundation.     Those whose professional and personal   suffer the most   are what Prinstein calls the   the kids who   were not only rejected but reacted to this by engaging in fights   or even becoming bullies themselves. It creates a vicious   cycle of increasingly lowered status and likability that can be   difficult to escape.     Even if an adult thinks they outgrew their problematic behavior   in high school and now have a great job and a family, they are   usually still hindered by their experience as a teenager. The   thing thats interesting is that if you speak with those who have   those impressive rsums who may not have been so likable and may   have had some difficulties with their popularity as kids, they   still feel insecure, no matter how many achievements they accrue   professionally, Prinstein said. They still feel a sense of   inferiority, a concern about being rejected by others, a   hyperfocus on potential rejection signals.     Prinstein clarified that ones status as a teenager, for better   or worse, is a strong indicator of how their adult life will   unfold, but it doesnt have to be permanent.     He said that he wants people who read his book to think about   their own experience with popularity as an adolescent and instead   of writing it off, to understand it. When you can come to terms   with who you were, you are then able to focus on who you are   today.     He also recommends that everyone focus on improving their   likability     in a genuine way.     We should make efforts to try and do things that are attentive   to others needs and to show people that we genuinely want to   interact with them, not use them for our purposes, he said.   Because the more likable you are, the more advantage you have in   every sphere. I mean, its amazing how much we give the benefit   of the doubt to likable people, and how much we are willing to do   for them and how much we just naturally think good things about   them.     Prinstein said likability is one of the most valuable social   commodities in all aspects of society. We should be investing   in it as much as we invest in anything else that we hope will   help our lives, he said.  Youre an adult now, you may think, and the. .."

Jeff Sessions had one hell of a bad week,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/10/2017,"Washington (CNN) When stories about you offering to resign due to increasingly strained relations with your boss are the high point of your week, you know its not been a good seven days. Thats how it went for Attorney General Jeff Sessions this week. Things started off poorly when a series of pieces detailed his ongoing issues with President Donald Trump. This, from CNNs Sara Murray and Stephen Collinson, paints an ugly picture for Sessions: Sessions and the President have had a series of heated exchanges in recent weeks, prompted by the attorney generals decision to recuse himself from the probe into Russia interference in the election and alleged collusion by Trump aides, a source close to Sessions told CNN on Tuesday. At one point, Sessions made clear he would be willing to resign if Trump no longer wanted him. Trump doesnt like to ever apologize, retreat or concede. On anything. Sessions did just that, in Trumps eyes, when he recused himself from the federal Russia probe after it was revealed he had not disclosed two meetings with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the 2016 campaign. Trump didnt like the decision at the time and has come to view it as the root of everything that led to the appointment of Bob Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. Following that spate of stories, you might think Trump or his surrogates would throw Sessions a life raft in the form of a vote of confidence. Instead, they let him twist in the wind    repeatedly refusing to say whether the President still had confidence in his attorney general. Absolutely, the President has confidence in all of his Cabinet, and if he didnt, they wouldnt be here, deputy White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Thursday. Which, in case youre new to politics, isnt exactly a   Sessions endorsement. Sessions week went from really bad to         on Thursday when fired FBI Director James Comey testified about his interactions with Trump over the Russia investigation. While Sessions wasnt the focus of the questions (or the answers) he came under some heavy criticism from his former underling. In explaining why he decided not to share his concerns about Trump with Sessions, Comey said: Our judgment, as I recall, was that he was very close to and inevitably going to recuse himself for a variety of reasons. We also were aware of facts that I cant discuss in an open setting that would make his continued engagement in a   investigation problematic. POW! Describing the February 14 meeting in which Sessions was asked to leave the Oval Office so Trump could talk to Comey alone, the deposed FBI director said: My sense was the attorney general knew he shouldnt be leaving, which is why he was lingering. WHACK! Things dont look like they will be getting better for Sessions anytime soon. According to CNNs reporting, Comey told senators in a   session Thursday that Sessions may have had a third interaction with Kisylak that had not been previously disclosed. Jeff Sessions, for being reminded that its always darkest just before it goes pitch black, you had the Worst Week in Washington. Congrats, or something."
Feinstein calls for investigation of all matters related to obstruction of justice,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/10/2017,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Dianne Feinstein is calling on the head of the Senate Judiciary Committee to investigate all issues related to obstruction of justice in the events leading up to the firing of FBI Director James Comey and the federal probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election, using subpoena authority if necessary. Watch CNNs interview with Sen. Dianne Feinstein about the federal investigations into Russian interference in the US election on State of the Union this Sunday, June 11, at 9 a. m. and noon ET. It is my strong recommendation that the Judiciary Committee investigate all issues that raise a question of obstruction of justice, the California Democrat wrote in a letter to Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley on Friday. These issues should be developed by our legal staff, presented to us, and be subject to full committee hearings. Feinstein is the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel and a member of the intelligence committee, both of which are investigating Russias efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election and related questions over the Trump campaigns contacts with Russian officials. Department of Justice special counsel Robert Mueller is also leading an investigation into those issues.  In the letter, Feinstein told Grassley she is concerned about Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and National Security Agency Director Admiral Rogers refusals to answer questions from senators, adding that she wants to determine whether Trump asked Coats or Rogers to take any action on the Russia investigation. As I have mentioned to you directly, I am supportive of issuing subpoenas in those cases where we do not receive cooperation, she wrote. Judiciary Committee spokesman Taylor Foy said Grassley appreciates Ranking Member Feinsteins  support and experience in the committees oversight activities. The two have worked closely on the committees review of matters related to Russian interference and the circumstances of James Comeys removal, including jointly seeking any White House tapes and the Comey memos, he said. Grassley values her input and welcomes the opportunity work together to gather the facts on behalf of the American people. Feinsteins letter came a day after former FBI Director James Comey testified before the intelligence committee about his conversations with Trump.  Comey, who was fired while leading the probe into Russias interference in the election, said Trump asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and implied Trump may have become the subject of investigation himself for interfering in the FBIs work. He repeatedly called the President a liar. You (Grassley) and I agree that these matters    termination of the FBI Director and any efforts to interfere with the independence of ongoing investigations    fall squarely in the jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee, Feinstein wrote in the letter. Feinstein said she also believes the committee should hear from officials Comey said he spoke with about his interactions with Trump, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and   FBI Director Andrew McCabe, who is now the acting director of the bureau. Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy, who is also a member of the Judiciary Committee, backed Feinsteins request on Twitter. I couldnt agree more with @SenFeinstein, he tweeted Friday. The American people deserve answers."
Trumps strain with Obama marks departure from presidential fraternity,CNN,Kevin Liptak,6/10/2017,"Washington (CNN) Nearly five months ago, President Donald Trump bid farewell to a grinning Barack Obama, waving as the military helicopter shuttling his predecessor into   House life got smaller and smaller. They havent spoken or seen each other since.  For a President who seeks extensive counsel from outside the White House    in calls to old friends, business executives, and even despotic foreign leaders    Trump has largely forgone advice or guidance from any of the men who have held his job previously.  In the months after Trump and Obama carried out a peaceful hand off of power, the two have failed to develop any sort of working relationship, according to White House advisers and former administration officials. They have not spoken over the phone, at least to the knowledge of their aides. Neither has made any real attempt to reconcile after Trump accused Obama of ordering wiretaps at his skyscraper in New York. Perhaps its a predictable outcome for two men with a long and bitter history to be sure, the   is the product of   enmity that extends well beyond differences in policy or style. But in the scope of recent history, its unprecedented for a sitting president and his predecessor to eschew even the faintest of ties. I dont think they have a relationship, said David Axelrod, who served as Obamas senior adviser during his first years in office. President Obama did what he could to help during the transition but, obviously, there have been intervening events. Not always frosty, It wasnt always so frosty. In the days following Trumps victory in November, Obama made a concerted effort to help guide his successor into place, despite personal animosity extending back to Trumps birther conspiracy. They spoke for more than an hour in the Oval Office, and Trump declared theyd developed warm ties. Cracks emerged before long, with Trump intervening in a dispute over Israeli settlements and later lashing out at the sitting President on Twitter. But on Inauguration Day, all appeared cheery as Obama and his wife welcomed the incoming first family to the White House for coffee. Once Trump was installed in office, however, things progressively soured, culminating in Trumps March tweets accusing Obama of ordering surveillance of Trump Tower. The baseless claim, which Obamas team denied, was said to irk and exasperate the former President. There was an effort to smooth things over, including in conversations between Trumps White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, and Obamas former White House chief of staff, Denis McDonough. But the talks never produced a phone call between the current and former presidents. And Trump, who hasnt backed down from his claim, continued his attacks on his predecessor. Well, he was very nice to me, but after that weve had some difficulties, Trump told CBS News in an interview in early May. He was very nice to me with words and when I was with him. But after that there has been no relationship. Obama reemerges, Since he made those comments, Trump has warily eyed Obama as he reemerges into public life. The two men were both in Europe last month, Obama for an appearance with German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin and Trump for summit meetings with his new foreign counterparts.  Trumps first talks at NATO headquarters in Brussels had to be shifted to the afternoon to accommodate Merkels schedule with Obama, according to people familiar with the meetings planning. This week, Obama met with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau after delivering remarks in Montreal that warned against authoritarianism    remarks that were seen as veiled jabs at Trump. Both Merkel and Trudeau participated in     meetings last month in Sicily, where Trump was isolated on issues like climate change. Republicans close to Trump say Obamas active schedule with foreign leaders has caught the Presidents eye as he works to develop his own relationships with world leaders. But they stopped short of saying Trump has expressed worry about Obamas private conversations with foreign leaders. Even though President Trump may not like it, having Obama out there speaking with leaders, even if its critical of Trump, is probably helpful, said Julian Zelizer, a presidential historian at Princeton. He might be serving a diplomatic role that the administration itself is not fulfilling. Presidents Club, Presidents have long relied on their predecessors for advice on a job few could possibly understand. Sometimes they have called on members of the   Presidents Club to carry out tasks on behalf of the United States. The current shutdown in ties between Trump and Obama amounts to the first time in decades a sitting president has closed off all communication with his predecessor    and, by extension, one of the only individuals with direct knowledge of a role few have played. There are only six people on the planet who fully understand the demands of that job, Axelrod said. Its often helpful, but certainly not mandatory, to be able to counsel with them. But thats totally up the discretion of the incumbent, who in this case has without evidence accused his predecessor of what would amount to a crime. That suggests to me that theyre probably not chatting much. In early June 2001, George W. Bush encountered his predecessor Bill Clinton at a Boston funeral in their first   meeting since the handoff of power months earlier. The two men sat in the same pew of St. Brigids Church alongside Al Gore    Clintons vice president who Bush ultimately defeated after a prolonged court battle the prior year.  As Bushs presidency wore on, he and Clinton developed friendly ties, speaking by phone with some regularity about the aspects of the job only they could understand. Days before taking office, Obama convened all the living presidents to solicit advice about the job. Bush hosted the session in his private dining room. Historians said it was the first time all living presidents had convened at the White House. About a month later, Obama placed an unusual phone call to his predecessor to inform Bush he was planning to announce a withdrawal of troops from Iraq    a conversation Obamas aides said was a courtesy to the man who began the war that Obama ran vowing to end. The phone call, made from a holding room at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina, was brief, but it did reflect open lines of communication between political and ideological opposites    a channel that thus far hasnt been dug between Obama and Trump. Open hostility, Last week, when Trump decided to withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord, few even questioned whether Obama    whose administration helped broker the landmark agreement    would be given a heads up. Instead, Trump tore into Obama for negotiating, in his view, a humiliating deal that had foreign leaders laughing at the US. Obama, in one of his first overly political statements since leaving office, declared Trumps decision to reject the future deeply misguided.  Withdrawing from the Paris agreement was one of the most consequential announcements of Trumps young presidency, which has been most successful in reversing Obama policies.  In taking those steps, Trump has made little effort to mask his disdain for his predecessor or his decisions, the open hostility reflecting a harsher tone than presidents past who took the country in new directions. Even bitter rivals have found ways to reconcile. Despite griping in private about each others shortcomings, John F. Kennedy and Dwight D. Eisenhower carried out regular consultations about national security matters after Kennedy took power from the Army general in 1960.  Only three months after taking office, Kennedy was strolling the grounds of Camp David with Eisenhower discussing the botched Bay of Pigs invasion.  No one knows how tough this job is until after he has been in it a few months, a bewildered Kennedy confessed to Eisenhower, according to his biographer Stephen E. Ambrose. If you will forgive me, Eisenhower replied, I think I mentioned that to you three months ago."
Former Rep. Giffords receives tributes at ship commissioning,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/10/2017,"Washington (CNN) Former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011 that led to her resignation from Congress, received touching tributes Saturday from female politicians and military officials at a commissioning ceremony for a warship named after her. With the naming of the littoral combat ship, the Arizona Democrat became the first living woman  to have a Navy warship bear her name since the Lady Washington was named after Martha Washington in 1776 and Giffords is only the third living woman in US history to see her name on a naval vessel. The U. S. S Gabrielle Giffords is strong and tough just like her crew, Giffords said in a brief speech. Despite danger, you say yes. You make me proud, you make America proud. I will never forget this day or this crew. Courage, perseverance and commitment to service were among the words several used to describe Giffords at the ceremony in Galveston, Texas, which featured remarks by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, former second lady Jill Biden and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California. Just as the motto I am ready represents the ship, it represents Gabby Giffords, Clinton said in her speech to attendees.  We all know what happened to Congresswoman Giffords, Clinton continued. But she came out of that experience with grace and faith . .. and time and time again, she has stood up ready to keep moving forward to persevere with her trademark humor, kindness and relentless optimism. Biden, who also spoke at the ships christening in 2015, said the navy chose wisely in naming the combat ship after Giffords. Giffords is here because she refused to let the tragedy overshadow the ideals that define her and the lives lost five years ago, Biden said Saturday. Honor, courage, commitment, thats why we are here, to give full meaning to these ideals, so that whenever the U. S. S. Gabrielle Giffords travels, the world will know that it is unstoppable, and it is the full definition of a patriotism that defines the greatest most powerful country in the world. After the shooting, which occurred at a constituent event in Tuscon, Giffords was left disabled, and she resigned from her seat in Congress in January 2012. That same day,   Secretary Ray Mabus told her of plans to name a ship after her, which occurred at the Pentagon the next month. Others in attendance Saturday included a handful of Democratic lawmakers, including California Reps. Nanette Barragn and Susan Davis, Minnesota Rep. Betty McCollum and Florida Rep. Kathy Castor, as well as actress Olivia Munn. Excited to celebrate the commissioning of the #USSGabrielleGiffords with my amazing friends @GabbyGiffords  @ShuttleCDRKelly!! #USSGG, Munn tweeted on Friday. Honored to attend the Commissioning Ceremony of the  USS Gabrielle Giffords #USSGG @GabbyGiffords! , Barragn tweeted. Giffords husband Mark Kelly, a retired Navy captain, combat veteran and NASA astronaut who, along with her, founded the   group Americans for Responsible Solutions in 2013, also delivered remarks, .  Those of you know who know Gabby best know what connects her most to the U. S. S Gabrielle Giffords is not the 418 feet of gray metal, he said. Its not her top speed . .. not her shallow draft. . .. Its not even Gabbys name emblazoned on the back. Its simply this: Its the crew    the men and women and their shared commitment to a value more American than any other . .. that is service."
Former congressman calls out fellow Republicans for defending Trump,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/10/2017,"Washington (CNN) A former GOP representative argued Friday that if President Donald Trump were a Democrat, there would be more backlash from Republicans over the firing of FBI Director James Comey. If Hillary Clinton had won and Comey had   an investigation into her email server and she didnt like the way it was going and she fired him, Im quite certain my party would be rightly howling, Bob Inglis, a former South Carolina representative, told CNNs Erin Burnett Friday on OutFront. When the shoes on this foot, its like, Oh, well, hes new at it.  The former politician, who lost his   bid in 2010, also called out House Speaker Paul Ryan for his defense of Trump. @SpeakerRyan you know this isnt true, Inglis tweeted, linking to an article titled Ryan denies GOP would try to impeach Dem accused of same actions as Trump.  You know that you would be inquiring into impeachment if this were a D. Inglis argued Ryan, who he called a friend, is apologizing for Trump too much. The former congressman was among 30 former GOP lawmakers who signed an   letter in October 2016. They wrote the   made a makes a mockery of their principles. Inglis, who voted for the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, said the substance of the investigation into the Trump administration is way more serious. In the case of Bill Clinton, we were dealing with sex in the White House with an intern and then a cover up, Inglis said. Thats quite different substance than a hostile country affecting or attempting to affect the outcome of our presidential election. He said Clinton also never fired the FBI director when he didnt like the way an investigation was going. The investigation into Russias probe in the 2016 election and the Trump administrations potential ties to Russia is more similar to President Richard Nixons situation, Inglis said. He cited the Saturday Night Massacre, during which Nixon tried to get rid of the people that were pursuing the investigation into Watergate. It didnt work out for Nixon, and I really think Donald Trump might have learned that its probably not a good idea, Inglis said. Because there are an awful lot of FBI agents now that want to make sure they get to the bottom of this. Still, he said its too early to tell whether Trump could be impeached. What the House has to do is look at these facts and . .. not hold back with any explanations or minimizing it or explaining it away, he said. But rather say, Now listen here: This is a serious matter. Somebody here might have participated in a hostile countrys attack on the heart of our republic, and were going to get to the bottom of it. And if it leads to the President, or to his family, or to anybody in his campaign, so be it."
Trump to reveal new Cuba policy in speech next Friday,CNN,Patrick Oppmann,6/10/2017,"Washington  (CNN) President Donald Trump is expected to reveal his administrations new policy toward Cuba in a speech in Miami next Friday, according to two US officials. Trump is due to roll back portions of the   policies softening relations with Cuba, CNN reported in May. Officials previously said that Trump will likely announce the United States will no longer make unilateral concessions to Cuba, which is what critics accused the Obama administration of doing.  Miami has long been an enclave for   Cuban exiles. US officials said Trump is likely to blast the Cuban government for human rights abuses and impose sanctions on officials suspected of carrying out the repression of dissidents. The officials also previously said Trump is expected to demand that US fugitives of justice, such as Assata Shakur, who received political asylum on the island after being convicted of killing a New Jersey state trooper and escaping from a US prison, be extradited. The Obama administrations changes were viewed as a significant relaxation of tensions between US and Cuba since Fidel Castros 1959 revolution. During his time in office, President Barack Obama exchanged prisoners with the Cuban government, reestablished diplomatic relations with Havana and became the first US president since 1928 to visit Cuba. In January, Cuban President Raul Castro, who has said he will step down in February 2018, said his government wished to pursue a respectful dialogue and cooperation on topics of common interest with the new government of President Donald Trump. White House press secretary Sean Spicer indicated in February that a tougher posture toward Cuba could be in the works. We are in the midst of a full review of all US policies towards Cuba, Spicer said. The President is committed to an agenda of ensuring human rights for all citizens throughout the world and as we review those policies in Cuba, that will be forefront in those policy discussions. Cuban officials have not yet commented on news of Trumps speech or potential policy changes."
ICE Officers Round Up 113 Criminal Aliens in New Jersey Sweep,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/10/2017,"U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcements (ICE) Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) officers arrested 113 criminal illegal aliens in New Jersey this week during a   enforcement surge. [Officers targeted criminal aliens throughout the state during an operation from June 5 to 9. Officials reported 93 of the illegal aliens arrested had criminal convictions and 87 percent of those arrested had felony convictions, according to information obtained by Breitbart Texas from ICE officials.  The continued results of our Fugitive Operations officers and their law enforcement partners underscore ICEs ongoing and steady commitment to public safety, Newark ERO Field Director John Tsoukaris said in a written statement. As part of this operation, we continue focus on the arrest of individuals who are criminal and are a threat to public safety and national security. Because of the tireless efforts of these professional officers, there are 113 fewer criminals in our communities, he added. The criminal aliens nabbed ranged in ages between    and   . The crimes committed by these individuals included convictions for sexual offenses and offenses against children, including sexual assault on a minor, sexual exploitation of a minor, sex offense against a   and child abuse. Other crimes against the person included aggravated assault, threats to kill, domestic violence and battery. Some of the more egregious criminal aliens included: The aliens arrested also had priors for theft crimes, including theft by the use of weapons or force     robbery, burglary, larceny, illegal use of credit cards, fraud, and theft of U. S. government property. Other convictions included: possession of, or distribution of narcotics, trespassing, damage to property, driving under the influence, possession of a weapon, and illegal reentry, officials reported. The foreign nationals were from the following   of countries: Bangladesh, Central African Republic, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, India, Iraq, Ireland, Jamaica, Jordan, Korea, Latvia, Liberia, Mexico, Morocco, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Philippines, Peru, Poland, Slovakia, Trinidad and Uruguay. The New Jersey Field Office for ICE, the New Jersey State Parole Office, and ICE Homeland Security Investigations assisted ICE ERO agents in arresting these criminal aliens. U. S. Customs and Border Protection is extremely proud to have assisted in this operation, said Leon Hayward, acting director of the New York Field Office. It is through collaborative efforts, such as the one leading to todays arrests, that law enforcement agencies can combat illegal acts and apprehend criminals who pose a threat to the Homeland.  A statement obtained from ICE by Breitbart Texas said that the agency is focusing on smart, effective immigration enforcement that targets serious criminal aliens who present the greatest risk to the security of our communities, such as those charged with or convicted of homicide, rape, robbery, kidnapping, major drug offenses and threats to national security.  ICE officials reported a near 40 percent increase in the numbers of criminal aliens arrested during Presidential Donald Trumps first 100 days in office. ERO officers have removed many violent offenders off the street, including those who were under ICE detainers but were released. On June 1, Breitbart Texas reported that officials with the New York City Department of Corrections (NYCDOC) released    Andres Flores Lopez from jail after he served time for a misdemeanor sexual offense. ICE ERO officers issued a detainer requesting authorities to detain him. In spite of giving the notice six months in advance, NYCDOC jail officials released the Mexican national who had two sexual abuse convictions, and they did so without notifying ICE. Following his release by local authorities, ICE officials issued a notice for the convicted sex offender to appear before an immigration judge for removal proceedings. When Flores Lopez failed to show up for his scheduled hearing, ERO officers tracked him down and arrested him in late May.

EXCLUSIVE: U.N. Secretary-Generals Report to Slam Israel Over Impact of Settlements on Palestinians,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/10/2017,"The United Nations is preparing to release yet another   report, blaming Israeli settlements for a host of Palestinian grievances for everything from excessive use of force to building parks on the West Bank so as to entrench Israeli presence     the report coming just days after the 50th Anniversary of the beginning of the 1967   war. [The report, a copy of which has been seen by Breitbart News, was drafted by the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) and submitted in the name of   Antnio Guterres to the General Assemblys Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).  The report says: Israel has employed discriminatory policies and practices, use of force that has been deemed excessive, and restrictions on the freedom of movement, including the closure on Gaza, settlement expansion, destruction of property and the exploitation of natural resources in the Occupied Palestinian Territory and the occupied Syrian Golan, It accuses Israel of violating international law and also exacerbating the social and economic conditions of Palestinians in the area. Arguing that the impact of Israeli policies is   and has accumulated over the decades of occupation, the  s report says: Israeli practices and policies in the occupied Palestinian territory and the occupied Syrian Golan violate fundamental provisions of international humanitarian and human rights law. Certain Israeli practices may amount to forcible displacement of the protected population, a grave violation of the Fourth Geneva Convention. The report is in response to an ECOSOC resolution in August which said the Israeli occupation has gravely impeded the efforts to achieve sustainable development and a sound economic environment in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and in the occupied Syrian Golan and expressed grave concern about the consequent deterioration of economic and living conditions.  It requested an annual report from the Secretariat on the subject. As the  s report noted, these are the extensive demands given to Israel by ECOSOC resolutions: [T]he full opening of the border crossings of the Gaza Strip and the full implementation of the Agreement of Movement and Access of 15 November 2005 the need to preserve the territorial contiguity, unity and integrity of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and guarantee the freedom of movement of persons and goods, including through compliance with the Protocol on Economic Relations between the Government of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization (the Paris Protocol) full respect of the rules of international humanitarian law and to refrain from violence against the civilian population cessation of the destruction of homes, properties, economic institutions, agricultural lands and orchards the immediate end of the exploitation and the degradation of natural resources the cessation of settlement and   activity accountability for the illegal actions perpetrated by Israeli settlers urgent attention to the plight and rights of Palestinian prisoners and detainees and compliance with the provisions of the Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War and to facilitate visits of the Syrian citizens of the occupied Syrian Golan whose family members reside in their mother homeland, the Syrian Arab Republic. However, the report is notable not just for the list of demands it imposes on Israel, but also the list of grievances, which almost entirely focuses on Palestinian concerns. It expresses serious concerns about possible extrajudicial executions and accuses them of delaying the return of bodies of Palestinian terrorists     something it claims amounts to collective punishment and violates the Fourth Geneva Convention. It also accuses Israeli settlers of vandalizing olive trees, harassing Palestinians, and creating tourist attractions and national parks as a way to entrench Israeli presence in the West Bank. It dedicates few lines to Palestinian attacks against Israel. Although it notes that during the reporting period of April 2016 to March 2017, 12 Israelis were killed and 162 injured, it only reports the fact in the context of also saying that 63 Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces, and 2, 276 were injured     noting that at least some of those were killed attempting to carry out terrorist attacks. While the   expresses a commitment to a secure Israel, he also concludes: The Israeli occupation entails practices and policies that violate the principle of   as well as international humanitarian and human rights law.   But the report was always unlikely to be a positive one for the only thriving democracy in the Middle East and U. S. closest ally in the region. ESCWA, the organization that prepared the report, withdrew a report in March that called Israel an apartheid state after pressure by Guterres     and after furious objections from U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley. After the report was withdrawn, the   of ESCWA     Rima Khalaf     resigned over the push to withdraw the report. However, while Guterres pushed to have the report withdrawn, his spokesman later clarified that it was not the content of the report he objected to, but that the publication occurred without the consultation of the necessary departments     including the   himself. A spokesman for the   told Breitbart News that the new report focuses on the issues at hand.  The report is based on facts gathered from multiple sources and both Israel and Palestine were given a chance to comment on it before its publication, the spokesman said. On principle, the  s clearly denounces terrorism and stresses the need for Israelis and Palestinians to engage directly in discussions to finally achieve a just peace. Nothing in the report changes those views, he said. The new report also relies heavily on a number of resolutions from the controversial Human Rights Council     a body known for its   bias, and which U. S. Ambassador Nikki Haley recently called a haven for dictators, warning that if it doesnt reform, the U. S. may leave. She noted in a speech to the Council this week that neither Venezuela nor Cuba has been the subject of a resolution, but Israel was the subject of five in March alone. If this report is similar to those of previous years, the U. S. cannot support it, a spokesman for Haley told Breitbart News. These reports from ESCWA have been   and biased, and they do nothing to achieving the aspirations of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples, and such reports do nothing to secure a peaceful and secure future for both peoples.    Guterres stirred controversy earlier this week on the day of the anniversary of the 1967   war, his remarks upsetting American and Israeli officials when he hit Israel for its occupation.  This occupation has imposed a heavy humanitarian and development burden on the Palestinian people, he said. Among them are generation after generation of Palestinians who have been compelled to grow up and live in ever more crowded refugee camps, many in abject poverty, and with little or no prospect of a better life for their children.  Israels ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, accused the   of disseminating Palestinian misinformation.  Any attempt at a moral equivalency between killing innocent people and the building of homes is absurd, he said. Adam Shaw is a politics reporter for Breitbart News based in New York.

The happiest couples  married or not  tend to share a key characteristic,Business Insider,Erin Brodwin,6/10/2017,"The sun is out, flowers are blooming, and your refrigerator is so   cluttered with wedding invitations you can hardly find the   handle.     Theres nothing quite like wedding season to get you   contemplating the next phase of your relationship. So youre   probably wondering     lets just say theoretically     how   might tying the knot affect my partner and I? Will it make us   happier? Strengthen our relationship?     Aside from the enthusiastic friend or extended family member, you   probably have loads of anecdotal evidence suggesting that the   answers to both of those questions is yes. After all, thousands   of Pinterest boards cant lie     or can they?     Interestingly, the bulk of sociological research on this topic   actually suggests that it isnt marriage thats the key to   lasting happiness, but something far more basic. It all comes   down to finding a romantic partner who also happens to be the   person youd call your best friend.     In a recent study of thousands of couples on marriage and   happiness,  a University of British Columbia economist   and the   of the  found evidence suggesting that the   most important factor for a lasting, happy relationship was   whether or not you see your romantic partner as your   closest friend.     Helliwell and his research team looked at data from two large   British surveys and the Gallup World Poll. After accounting for   couples age, gender, income, and health conditions, they found   that couples who were best friends and lived together were just   as happy as couples who were best friends and married.     In other words, marriage didnt appear to matter much at all.     Heres a chart from the study comparing the life satisfaction   of couples who were married (blue bars) with couples who lived   together but were unmarried (red bars). Couples who said their   partner was their best friend are on the left.        What immediately intrigued me about the results was to rethink   marriage as a whole, Helliwell recently .     Other research seems to support Helliwells findings.        For their  researchers found that   couples who lived together but were not married had higher     and were happier overall than their married   counterparts.     In a recent  social psychologist Bella   DePaulo took a look at a large 2012 review of more than . Initially, the researchers   concluded that marriage made people happier. But taking a closer   look at the numbers, DePaulo came to the opposite conclusion.     Except for that initial   honeymoon effect for life   satisfaction, she writes, getting married did not   result in getting happier or more satisfied. In fact, for life   satisfaction and relationship satisfaction, the trajectories over   time headed in the less satisfied direction.     Other studies back up DePaulos assertion: A  found that couples   who got married generally felt less happy and less satisfied with   their lives over time.     Helliwell prefers to look on the bright side of these findings.     Maybe what is really important [in a relationship] is   friendship, and to never forget that in the push and pull of   daily life, he said.  The sun is out, flowers are blooming, and your. .."
New York Attorney General is looking into issues with Eric Trumps charity,Business Insider,David Choi,6/10/2017,"The New York Attorney Generals office is reportedly looking   into The Eric Trump Foundation, a charity founded by Eric Trump,   a spokesman for the attorney general said in a  Friday.     The attorney generals office is looking into issues at the Eric   Trump Foundation raised by the Forbes report, spokesman Eric   Soufer said in a statement to The Post.     Forbes June 6 report raised questions about the various   expenditures the foundation made from 2007 to 2015.     The report found that the foundation paid President Donald   Trumps businesses $1. 2 million for expenses in connection to its     charity tournaments at the Trump National Golf Club in   New York.     Contrary to Trumps claims that the Trump Organization allowed   the foundation to use its golf course for free and financed most   expenses for the foundations charity events, Forbes   investigation and IRS filings revealed that the Trump National   Golf Club billed the foundation hundreds of thousands of dollars   for years.      After costs for the tournament ballooned from $46, 000 to $142, 000   in 2011, one person familiar with the charity said that Donald   Trump had a cow and flipped.

"10 months ago, Univision bought Gawker in a fire sale, and its been messy ever since",Business Insider,Maxwell Tani,6/10/2017,"The man tasked with overseeing Gizmodo Media Group after the   demise of Gawker. com says he never regularly read the site in the   first place.     Im well past the demographic they were aiming for, CEO Raju   Narisetti said in an interview. If you ask me if it was a place   I spent a lot of time on on a daily basis, the answer is no.     Narisetti is leading GMG through the media companys merger with   Fusion Media Group, which is owned by the     juggernaut Univision. According to the CEO, the transition has   been a success.     But conversations with over a dozen current and former employees   painted a starkly different picture.     Since the deal, the six former Gawker Media sites     Gizmodo,   Jezebel, Deadspin, Kotaku, Jalopnik, and Lifehacker     have   struggled with indecision, a dysfunctional bureaucracy, and an   exodus of top leadership and institutional knowledge that gave   Gawker Media its editorial bite.     Mergers have a tendency to be messy, and Gawker Medias entry   into Univisions portfolio is far from the most troubled media   acquisition in recent history.     News Corp. bungled its   takeover of Myspace after   failing to cater to the   platforms users and trying   to monetize the site too quickly, for example, while the 2000   merger of then newspaper giants Tribune Media and Times Mirror   Co. generated massive turnover at the company,  among shareholders, and . Then theres the infamous     Warner deal, and AOLs current complicated merger with Yahoo.     Still, many GMG staffers wonder what will remain of the clever,   fearless attitude that defined the sites for millions of readers   and set the tone for much of the independent web.     A lot of people who made Gawker Media what it was have either   left or been so beaten down that the company it used to be   doesnt exist anymore, one GMG employee said.     Some of the Gawker ethos is sort of showing up in the   publications that people have dispersed to, but its never going   to be the same. Univision claimed that they wanted to buy Gawker   because they believe in fearless journalism, but every decision   theyve made seems to be an effort to either water the Gawker   spirit down as much as possible or just bolster Fusion TV in some   way.     Univision bought Gawker Media last August in a fire sale. It   shuttered the iconic Gawker. com, which was viewed as toxic after   a court ordered Gawker Media to pay Terry Bollea     aka Hulk Hogan       $140 million for publishing a sex tape featuring the wrestler.   The lawsuit was secretly funded by Peter Thiel, the early   Facebook investor and board member who was publicly outed by the   publication as gay years earlier.        The company bought Gawker Media, which it renamed Gizmodo Media   Group, with the hope of broadening the audience to become the   voice and reflection of an increasingly diverse young America,   with a slightly less intense editorial focus on the trademark   skepticism and disdain for powerful interests.     Now, several months into the merger, Narisetti said that contrary   to the conventional wisdom, data shows its been a pretty   good few months since the six sites were bought by Univision and   joined with Fusion. net and The Root.     The CEO, who joined GMG in October from News Corp. rattled off     statistics that showed a company growing after a   tumultuous multiyear legal battle with Hogan that took the   company from a  to bankruptcy.     Narisetti said last week that even after he had hired 53 new     staffers across the websites, the company remained   under budget and on target to experience a 30% increase in   revenue across the sites in one year.     Traffic to the sites has remained steady at about 90 million   monthly unique visitors since he took over in October, certainly   an accomplishment considering Fusions  and the loss of the 15   million to 16 million monthly uniques that Gawkers flagship   website generated.     Other Fusion Media Group sites that were integrated into the GMG   portfolio have thrived. Since transitioning over to GMGs Kinja   publishing platform in January, the   digital   magazine The Root has 35% more uniques each month than it did in   the same months last year.     Narisettis   goal is to turn the network of sites into   a publication catering to a diverse, young America of the future.   By 2028, Narisetti said, a majority of young Americans will be   nonwhite.     Our view is, he added, while there are a lot of   brands   for Americans today, there arent a lot of   brands for what   is going to be a much more diverse young America.     But he acknowledges it hasnt always been easy to execute that   vision.     At an   I joked, Ive never lost more sleep and gained   more weight in the same period, Narisetti said. Its been a   great and a challenging year.     For many GMG employees, challenging is an understated   description of the past several months.     Conversations with more than a dozen current and former staffers   over the past several weeks detailed a difficult integration that   has chipped away the spirit and ethos of Gawker Media, founded 14   years ago by Nick Denton as two blogs covering media and tech   gossip, which eventually evolved into the fiercely independent,   proudly standoffish, endlessly   media company   targeted by Thiel and Hogan.     Staffers say they felt initial relief after Univision beat out   the media company Ziff Davis to buy GMG out of bankruptcy for   $135 million. But now the environment is, as one employee put it,   toxic, and as downcast as it was during some of the Hogan   trial.     Every day, morale got worse because it felt like Univision was   determined to stamp out all the great things about working at   Gawker Media, one former GMG staffer told Business Insider.   They had no interest in maintaining our editorial philosophy,   having a functioning HR department, or retaining key talent.     In the nine months since the acquisition, the company formerly   known as Gawker Media has seen an exodus of top talent and   leadership.     Heather Dietrick, the president of Gawker Media and then of GMG,   . The editorial teams    deputy   executive editor Lacey Donohue, left in late 2016 and was   followed by the executive managing editor, Katie Drummond, in   March. Matt Hardigree left the company in May after working as   the editor of Jalopnik and partnerships.   reporters   like Christina Warren and Ashley Feinberg have also left the   company in recent weeks.        The heads of the   and legal departments, both   figures with outsize power and importance at the formerly   independent, freewheeling company, also departed in the early   months of the acquisition.     Business Insider has counted the resignations of at least 26   former Gawker Media employees since the merger, many of them in     positions.     After  about its own relationship with female   leaders at the company, the final iteration of Gawker Media was   one with women in the most senior roles in the company, a source   of pride and loyalty for many staffers.     But months later, with top leaders departing, some employees   wonder whether the company is doing enough to persuade respected   female leaders to remain, and if the company will suffer from the   talent and leadership losses its already experienced.     People are really worried about this, one GMG employee said.   Just since Katie left, weve lost our president, our top video   journalist, and our best reporter, and thats after a big     meeting where people were really clear about how   alarming the pattern was.     There are women being promoted or hired into positions of power,   and Im sure there will be more, but even if the   do   all the right things from now on, its not like you can really   fix it, because youve lost so many of the people who made the   place what it was at its best.     As WWD reported, after Drummonds departure in March, the   editorial union  to management criticizing the   loss of top female leaders.     We were extremely alarmed to hear that Katie Drummond will not   become executive editor and instead leave Gizmodo Media,   .     It continues a disturbing pattern of top managements failure to   retain women in positions of authority, and raises serious   concerns about the companys commitment to honor its contractual   obligation to editorial independence. Further, it is yet another   sign that Univision still has not found a way to manage the   successful independent media company it acquired months ago.     Drummonds departure remains a source of tension.     According to multiple sources familiar with the situation,   Drummond was paid significantly less than the companys previous   top editor, John Cook, while essentially filling in for him for   several months without a title change. And when she was offered   the title of executive editor, the sources say, Drummond was told   it was rude to ask for a raise.     Narisetti told Business Insider that although he would not   discuss private discussions of compensation, the characterization   was inaccurate, as Drummond was assisted by the newly created   role of deputy executive managing editor specifically created to   support her while the company mulled who would fill the executive   editor position that would oversee now eight sites, including The   Root and Fusion.        At the same time, two sources said, Dietrick was almost   completely sidelined by management after the acquisition late   last year, as Narisetti and others assumed many of her previous   responsibilities.     Narisetti dismissed charges that GMGs struggle to retain women   in top roles was a cultural problem at the company.     Though he said he was not minimizing the effect many top women   like Dietrick and Drummond had during the past several years, he   pointed out that GMGs editorial leadership remained slightly   more female than male, and he emphasized he was not going to   play defense on it.

Im more concerned about my character than my reputation,   because my character is who I am and my reputation is what others   think I am, he said previously. One is permanent, and one is   changeable based on peoples views. I have no doubt that weve   lost some people and no less and no more than a lot of companies   do in the first year of an acquisition and a merger and an   integration.     Beyond struggling with holding together the former Gawker   editorial team and mission, Univision also lost the confidence of   many employees with basic operational issues that surfaced while   it tried to integrate its new acquisition.     Numerous bureaucratic problems became almost immediately   apparent, making the formerly nimble independent company feel   like a dysfunctional cog in a massive, sluggish machine. For   example, employees say Univisions teams responded slowly or were   unresponsive to significant payroll and benefits problems that   roiled the company for months.     The company delayed annual raises, they continued, and multiple   staffers received accidental notes that stated other employees   salaries. According to two sources with direct knowledge of the   incident, one GMG editorial staffer was accidentally sent a list   of individual salaries for the entire editorial union, amounting   to hundreds of people. In it, the person discovered that a peer   in the editorial staff was being paid more than $400, 000, a   significantly higher number than most of the newsroom.     Employees faced similar problems with benefits.     Several employees say they had their insurance denied on visits   to the doctor and were unable to pick up prescriptions. Others   were charged for insurance they did not select, a source said.   Two people recalled a top site editor having their newborn child   go weeks without   benefits.     Narisetti acknowledged that payroll and benefit issues had been a   source of anxiety for the staff, telling Business Insider that   the company didnt have a plan B in place when Gawkers HR team   left en masse.     In an   email sent in February that was provided to   Business Insider, the CEO apologized and said GMG was working on   the issues, though benefits and HR problems persisted to the   point that the editorial union in April gave the company a     deadline to resolve them.        It has been an unexpectedly bumpy transition, to put it mildly,   he wrote. And I want to personally acknowledge and apologize on   behalf of Univision, FMG and GMG, for all the stress and angst   this is causing. Like all of you, I am also inclined to focus on   our journalistic and business challenges than dissipate any of   our time and energy on fighting internal issues. But we clearly   need to get these internal issues in order and we will.     For its part, GMG has made explicit attempts to continue Gawkers   history of provocative investigations.     Cook     who moved from executive editor to oversee the     desk     oversees a team primarily made up of   former Gawker writers.     He told Nieman Lab last month that the creation of the   investigations unit sort of offset the loss of Gawker by   continuing to pursue provocative investigations, such as showing   it to be quite easy to   top government officials.     tttWhen Peter Thiel killed Gawker he forgot to kill its brains:      From a distance, it seems like the acquirer values the   investigative journalism from John Cook and his team, Denton,   the Gawker founder, told Business Insider in an email when asked   about the merger. Im glad to see Univisions support for   investigative journalism at Gizmodo.     But GMG staffers are also having to adjust to a new environment   under heightened internal legal scrutiny.     Stories have also had to clear higher legal barriers in a way   that some employees feel is overly cautious and almost   distrustful of the sites aggressive, provocative journalism but   that the company says is the standard operating procedure for   most major media organizations.     According to employees with knowledge of the process, staff   members on the   desk are required to get the   companys legal team to sign off on any story they write, even   basic blog posts with no original reporting, and still have no   official website months after launching, negotiating with other   GMG sites about which site might best host an investigation.     Four current and former employees said the legal team was very   cautious of publishing exclusives about Thiels personal life and   intentionally slowed reporting related to the tech billionaire,   who financially supported the lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker.     In an email to members in June obtained by Business Insider, the   editorial union said it unsuccessfully tried to remove a     clause from separation agreements.     clauses are commonplace in separation   agreements, but some employees have taken them as a sign of   hostility from management to staff.     Staffers say they were similarly infuriated by the companys   decision to remove controversial posts tied up in litigation and,   without an official company policy, fear that it could happen   again.     It was extremely difficult to watch Univisions lawyer decline   the opportunity to defend their own colleagues work against a   malicious legal attack, one GMG employee told Business Insider.   People are absolutely concerned that Univision will try to   remove posts in the future.     FMG and GMG managers have also shied away at points from easy   opportunities to   Gawkers legacy.     When in February staffers tried to host a public screening of   Nobody Speak: Trails of the Free Press, a documentary about   Gawkers battle with Hogan, Narisetti,  vetoed the   proposal, eventually allowing only a private,     screening of the film.     In an email praising the rich, collective   of   Gawker, Narisetti noted that the company implemented a policy of   not engaging in discussions or debates on Gawker Media estate   issues.     We continue to face some ongoing business challenges around   effectively communicating the premise and promise of the new     and to keep moving ahead in 2017, as we continue to   still be hobbled by some (diminishing) past business   perceptions, he wrote. That is somewhat relevant in this   particular context     though quite secondary to the company policy   of not discussing Gawker issues     as a public   around   the movie, hosted by   can easily and unnecessarily add to   that ongoing challenge.        Narisetti argued that the hardest part of the transition was   behind GMG.     Several employees who lamented the mess of payroll and benefits   said that since the company brought on a new HR representative   last month, fewer problems had spilled out into the open.     The company, too, has prepared to begin seriously building out   the GMG properties for the first time since the merger.     Fusion, which confusingly ceded its Fusion. net domain last month   to the Fusion television channel, is set to relaunch with a new   domain name in June.     In addition to a parenting site it launched last week, according   to one source, the company plans to launch at least three new   sites. (Narisetti hinted at food, music, and the environment,   though Business Insider could not confirm the details.)     The   AV Club and Onion websites are expected to   migrate over to Kinja during the slower summer months, creating   one universal   system and allowing the company   to increase revenue by selling the entire package of sites to   advertisers as a whole.     My view is that we look back next year and say, That was a   rough six months, Narisetti said. Our journalism has held out,   were producing great stories. I use the famous Ronald Reagan   line, which is, If youre committing acts of journalism at GMG,   are you better off today than you were seven months ago?  I think   almost everybody will have to answer the question yes.   The man tasked with overseeing Gizmodo Media. .."
Family Research Council Launches Petition for Apology from Bernie Sanders for Religious Attack,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/10/2017,"The Family Research Council has launched a petition drive seeking an apology from Sen. Bernie Sanders ( ) for his remarks about Russell Vought, President Donald Trumps nominee for deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Budget Committee on Wednesday. [More than 35, 000 people have signed the petition letter to Sanders, which says, in part: Our Constitution guarantees there will be no religious litmus test. Americans should never be forced to choose between their faith and public service.   During the hearing Sanders didnt ask Vought about his financial expertise but questioned his belief that salvation is found alone through Jesus Christ, a belief expressed in a column he wrote last year. Sanders quoted the column and this exchange followed: Sanders: Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned. Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic? Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. Im a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith       Sanders:       Forgive me, we just dont have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view? Vought: Again, Senator, Im a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College.  (Vought attended the college.) Sanders: I understand that. I dont know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too? Vought: Senator, Im a Christian       Sanders (shouting): I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just     I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned? Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian thats how I should treat all individuals       Sanders:       Do you think thats respectful of other religions?       I would simply say, Mr. Chairman that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about.  Charisma News reported: Family Research Council President Tony Perkins issued a call to action for the organizations supporters, urging them to call their senators to demand that they rebuke U. S. Sen. Bernie Sanders ( .) for [the] bigoted remarks he made to Deputy OMB   Russell Vought in a confirmation hearing Wednesday. In the email, obtained by Charisma Caucus, Perkins wrote: Last night, U. S. senators witnessed one of the most stunning outbursts of religious bigotry and hostility in recent memory. U. S. Senator Bernie Sanders ( .) responded in anger after Russell Vought, President Trumps nominee to be deputy director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, answered a question about his belief that salvation is found alone through Jesus Christ. Sanders declared that Mr. Vought is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. Perkins Washington Update addressed the issue on the FRC website: Actually, Russell Vought is exactly what this country is about. Hes exercising the belief that America was founded upon: that we are one nation, under God. The ability to voice that belief     even in the public square     is the same vision that brought the Pilgrims to America. Honestly, it doesnt get any more central to Americas identity than that. But after two terms of trying to drive Christianity underground, the Left isnt about to declare a cease fire. If Bernie Sanderss comments are any indication, theyre more determined than ever to wipe men and women of faith off the public service map. Just because Christians believe what Jesus said about mans spiritual destiny (I am the way, the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me) doesnt mean they think other faith groups have no rights. On the contrary, Christians are the most consistent defenders of religious liberty for all. In a democratic society, Sanders said in a statement released after the backlash from his remarks, founded on the principle of religious freedom, we can all disagree over issues, but racism and bigotry     condemning an entire group of people because of their faith     cannot be part of any public policy."
Gas Prices Lowest for This Time of Year Since 2005 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/10/2017,"The average gasoline price nationwide is the cheapest it has been at this point in the year since 2005, according to GasBuddy, a site that monitors gas prices. [The national average for gasoline is now $2. 35 as of Friday   a   drop this week and two cents less than it was in 2016 at this point in the year.  Prices were lower Friday than in 2016 in 23 states, but states such as Kentucky, Ohio, Illinois, Michigan, Indiana, and Wisconsin see the most pronounced drop in prices. The New York Times reported that the cause of this major dip in price was due to the Energy Departments report that U. S. inventories of crude oil and gasoline surged a week before, despite a heavy travel Memorial Day weekend, when lots of cars were on the road. On Wednesday, crude oil went down five percent and plunged to less than $46 a barrel, a price that is close to a   low. The drop in price is striking given that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) decided to cut production this year, and Saudi Arabia recently cut ties with Qatar for supporting terrorism Monday. But this drop in oil prices is not expected to last forever. Energy experts say the low gasoline prices will only last for a few weeks because of high demand during the summer months. If oil prices stay low, prices will eventually go up even higher because of less oil production. This is a slump, a buying opportunity, and Americans can enjoy it, said Tom Kloza, energy analysis head of Oil Price Information Service. But I think it is a little bit of an anomaly, and I expect to see higher crude oil prices in the second half of the year."
Border Numbers Up 31 Percent in One Month as Catch and Release Continues,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/10/2017,"The apprehension of illegal border crossers by Border Patrol agents jumped 31 percent in May from the previous month. The jump follows a   decline in apprehensions after the election of President Donald Trump. The increase comes as Border Patrol agents report catch and release programs are quietly continuing. [While still down significantly from the peak in October 2016, Border Patrol agents apprehended 14, 535 illegal immigrants along the southwestern U. S. border with Mexico in May. That number is up from the   low number of 11, 126 reported in April. Since 2014, the number of apprehensions has increased from April to May.  The numbers of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) jumped a startling 50 percent from April to May (997 to 1, 493). During the same period, Family Unit Alien (FMUA) apprehensions jumped by 41 percent from 1, 118 in April to 1, 577 in May. Of the nine Border Patrol sectors along the U. S. southwest border, the Rio Grande Valley (RGV) Sector continues to lead in the numbers of total apprehensions, accounting for nearly half of the 46, 183 apprehensions since October 1, 2016. The next closest sector is the Tucson Sector at 5, 925. The RGV sector also leads in UAC and FMUA apprehensions. So far this year, 4, 082 UACs have been apprehended in South Texas while 8, 718 FMUAs were apprehended. The El Paso Sector came in second place in both UAC and FMU apprehensions (621 and 1, 482 respectively).  Border Patrol agents believe the resurgence can be attributed to the Trump Administrations quiet continuation of the Obama catch and release program, Breitbart Texas    Brandon Darby and investigative journalist Ildefonso Ortiz reported. Obamas catch and release is definitely continuing and our government is releasing illegal aliens into U. S. communities, Border Patrol agent Brandon Judd told Breitbart Texas in his capacity as president of the National Border Patrol Council. The steps taken for such releases have slightly changed and the numbers are not as high, but it is still occurring. Under Trump, ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement] is holding more illegal aliens than what they did under Obama, but make no mistake, ICE is still releasing a good number of illegal aliens into U. S. communities. Americans need to know this.  Agents previously expressed feeling betrayed by the new presidents administration after Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly appointed Kevin McAleenan as head of the U. S. Customs and Border Protection, the parent agency of the U. S. Border Patrol. He nominated this guy .. the problem is that this guy was hired by Barack Obama and was made deputy of [CBP] and all of the things we fought against on the border happened under this guys watch and he would have been the one responsible for implementing them. Thats DACA, DAPA and Catch and Release.  Darby said in a Pursuit of Happiness interview referring to some programs started under the Obama Administration. This is the guy who was picked by Barack Obama to enact Barack Obamas open border policies, Darby explained. This guy for some reason has been picked by Trump to be the boss of the border patrol agents who did so much and believed so much in Donald Trump.

ACLU Targets Jeff Sessions Wont Defend Michael Flynn - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/10/2017,"The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) wants the Senate to question Attorney General Jeff Sessions next week about his own role with Russia, his role in the Comey firing, and the ongoing investigations into ties with Russia and his recusal, according to a statement by the organization. [Sessions will appear on Tuesday before the Committee on Appropriations to testify about the Department of Justice budget.  The ACLU says that it is asking its over 2 million supporters to contact their representatives and urge them to ask Sessions tough questions.  Asked by Breitbart News what the relevance of the Russia investigation was for civil liberties in the United States, Christopher Anders, deputy director of the ACLUs legislative office, said: Its very fundamental to civil liberties, in that it goes right to the heart of our democracy, in our ability to vote, and that our votes are counted and are meaningful.  Russias hacking     or its attempt to hack     political parties and local voter databases raises concerns about integrity of voting and integrity of our elections, Anders said. Asked whether the ACLU had defended former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whose telephone calls were under surveillance, and whose name was leaked illegally to the media, Anders acknowledged that the organization had not defended him specifically, adding: We havent accused Michael Flynn of anything, either.  The ACLU had, Anders pointed out, raised the general issue of surveillance, and was concerned about the   of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which is thought to be the provision under which Flynns communications were intercepted. We have said there is a good reason to be concerned, Anders told Breitbart News. President Trump is raising a legitimate issue of concern about Americans communications being surveilled, and they shouldnt be, absent a specific warrant.  In recent months, the ACLU has adopted an aggressive stance against the Trump administration, one very close to the partisan positions of the Democratic Party. It has also organized Resistance training workshops for activists opposed to the Trump administrations policies. Noted civil libertarian Alan Dershowitz wrote last month in the Wall Street Journal: The ACLU was once a nonpartisan organization focused on liberty and equality before the law. In recent years it has chosen its battles with an increasingly   sensibility. In doing so, it has become considerably more equivocal and sometimes even hostile toward core civil liberties concerns of free speech and due process. But Anders defended the groups record, noting that it had supported Republicans like Sen. Rand Paul ( ) on civil liberties issues, and opposed certain policies of Democratic administrations in the past. He stressed the ACLUs commitment to defending the Constitution. Thats what were here to do, regardless of whos in power.  Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News. He was named one of the most influential people in news media in 2016.

Susie Breitbart Gives Rare Interview: Andrew Was Good Friend to So Many People Who Disagreed with Him - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/10/2017,"Susie Breitbart, the widow of Breitbart News founder Andrew Breitbart, talked to Greg Gutfeld of Fox News on The One with Greg Gutfeld about her husbands storied career in an interview last week. [Gutfeld began with a story of his own: how he met first met Andrew Breitbart while writing for the Huffington Post, which Andrew helped launch and edit. It was when Andrew encouraged Gutfeld to follow his own instincts (as opposed to micromanaging his talent) that the Fox News personality realized that Breitbart had major balls.   I remember that, and I remember hearing about you long before I met you because he was fascinated with what you were doing, and what you were writing, Susie Breitbart said with a chuckle. He loved your style, he loved your humor and your insight. He was, I think at that time, also really trying to own who he was, and become his own person, and no longer be in the shadows of people like Matt Drudge and Arianna Huffington.   The way you described him saying Can you change that? and then calling you back and saying no, wait, keep it the way it is, I think that was him sort of coming into his own at the same time and going, Lets own this, lets be who we are, she told Gutfeld. Gutfeld credited Andrew Breitbart with writing half of his best jokes. I would send a piece that would be like, lets say 1500 words. It would come back 3000 words because he added so many jokes, and some of them were so absurd and surreal and like from another planet that it would take a while to understand what he was doing. Then I would edit it out and I would go, No, wait, I cant edit this out, its too good! Gutfeld reminisced. He used to call those your double secret blog posts, Susie Breitbart said. You were kind of sneaking in through a back door of the Huffington Post and writing things you werent really supposed to.  Gutfeld compared the unusual group of friends around Andrew and Susie to the eclectic cast of a 1970s talk show.  That was a really interesting group, Susie agreed. I cant remember who initially formed that group. I want to say I think it was Dale Launer, a screenwriter. He wrote My Cousin Vinny, among other things. That group was just an eclectic group of writers and journalists, and not necessarily politically   people. Andrew was always just fascinated with storytellers, loved being around all types of people.  Gutfeld recalled his surprise at learning Susies father is prolific actor Orson Bean, who was for me kind of a Sixties and Seventies legend because he was on everything.  He was! she agreed. To some people my dad was a household name, and some people had never heard of him. Hes so many things to so many different people, because he has done so much. Hes a raconteur, most notably. He hosted The Tonight Show over a hundred times when Johnny Carson was absent, or he was a guest on The Tonight Show within those appearances. Hes been on Broadway, television, movies. He often gets recognized, and it kind of spans across various generations.  When we were growing up, game shows were huge, and theyre making a comeback, a lot of them, she said, remembering her fathers many appearances on classic shows. The Match Game, Tattletales     which he did with my mom, Caroline, which was like a couples game show. He did To Tell the Truth, and I think Hollywood Squares, all of those were a huge part of my growing up too.  Gutfeld recalled visiting Orson Beans house and discovering he kept a news clipping about the   terror attack pinned to his refrigerator door, because he said it was something that should be remembered every day. Susie Bean Breitbart said she believes the clipping holds that position on her fathers refrigerator to this very day. She hastened to add that her father is hardly a brooding man. He just finished doing a   show about his life. His life was very heavy and tragic as a child. Throughout the show, he would tell some really, really tragic story     and then follow it up immediately with a magic trick and a joke, to sort of lighten the mood, she said. You can watch his   show, its on YouTube. Thats his style.  Susie said she was never a political person herself, although her father and later her husband became major political presences. I always had my opinions, of course, but I was a registered independent from the first time I was old enough to vote. The first time I did vote was for H. Ross Perot, because Andrew and I were just kind of fascinated, and amused, and just trying to figure it all out, she recalled. At that time Andrew was becoming increasingly obsessed with the Clarence Thomas hearings, and politics became more prominent in his life. He became more interested in all of that, she said.  I was never political in the way he was. He started to be aware of the effect it was having. He would think, Susie never signed up for this, because as he became more of a public figure people would approach us and say things at dinner parties, and at schools. Its not something I had really been prepared for, said Susie Breitbart.  I think I always knew that Andrew was going to make a name for himself. When we met and started dating, he was a waiter. I looked at him and I said, This guys going to do something. He wanted to be a comedy writer, so I figured it was going to be that. He always was very funny. I never figured it would be this, but actually it doesnt surprise me. It was only a matter of, Whats he going to do next? Whats he going to be? Because it was going to be something, she said. Gutfeld recalled that politics was almost never the topic of discussion when he hung around with the   Andrew Breitbart. He wasnt angry, he said. I remember we all went on the National Review cruise together, and you and Andrew were both panelists, but other than the work you were doing there and the reason we were there, it was really just a vacation with friends. He was a lighthearted person. He could talk to anyone about anything. It didnt have to be politics, she said.  At some point that became difficult to navigate sometimes. I came home to our first apartment, when we first started dating, to find Jehovahs Witnesses trying to get out, because they were literally trapped in there. He was so fascinated with exploring people, and stories, and ideas. He could talk to anyone about anything, and he knew something about everything, she said. Of course, politics came to dominate Andrew Breitbarts later career, becoming the reason people wanted to talk to him in some instances.  Gutfeld remembered Andrews particularly strong feelings about 80s New Wave music. He had this Friday night Twitter DJ thing that he would do with 80s music, Susie said. Im still not on Twitter, so I wasnt able to really follow it when it was happening, but he loved it. He was obsessed with New Wave, British pop.  Gutfeld asked for Susies take on the most   facet of Andrews personality. I think because he considered himself to be somewhat of a warrior, people assume that he was an instigator, she observed. He really wasnt a  . He liked people to a fault. It was pretty easy to ingratiate yourself to Andrew. He was someone who felt that he needed to stand up for what was right, and stand up to bullies. There was this very intense   side of him, but the side that people didnt really get to see when he became more of a public figure was that he was such a lighthearted, funny, crazy, smart, sensitive guy.  There is some of that out there, she added. He went on your show Red Eye, and I think tweaked his nipples after snorting a powdered form of red wine or something.   Thats true! Gutfeld laughed.  Thats out there, but I dont think most people are Googling Breitbart along with the terms goofy, lighthearted, silly. Theyre more Googling controversy, Trump, you know, said Susie. Gutfeld recalled how Andrew was once thrown off his game before a Red Eye appearance because he was worried his daughter was mad at him for leaving a slumber party early. That was a bigger deal to him than anything, Gutfeld said. And he always used to say that he was so lucky he was married to you. He would say to me, I cant believe she married me. Because we would sit and commiserate over stuff, and he would say that. He would just laugh and go, How did I get this lucky?  Gutfeld laughed as he recalled the great downside to Andrews easy affection for people: He would introduce you to somebody that is not a good person, but he was so forgiving       he took in stray dogs, you know what I mean? He did, Susie agreed. My dad always says about his wife Alley when hes ready to leave a party, he says, She has a character flaw: She likes people. Andrew and I had to develop a kind of shorthand at some point that meant     me looking at him which said, I love you, but Im ready to go home. Ill be taking the car, and you can take a taxi in three hours when youre done talking to this guy.  And sometimes that guy would come home with him, and he would stay at our house for a weekend, she added. Im not kidding. He would bring people home, and just the way he opens my dads guest house to you       Yes! I was one of those stray dogs! Gutfeld cried. Sometimes we got lucky and the stray dog was Greg Gutfeld. Sometimes it wasnt so lucky, said Susie. He was really interested in just exploring peoples character and personalities. Sometimes he would delve in without really vetting the situation, I would say. He was a nice person, too. He didnt want to turn people away, I suppose, she said. Susie Breitbart said writing has been part of her healing process. Initially I started writing for my kids, because I want them to remember who he was as a person. Its so easy, I think of my own childhood so I can conjure up stories when Im asked, like what was it like growing up with my dad, or whatever, she recalled.  Really I feel like most of the time Im just culling through like a shoebox full of Polaroid pictures, and I have to really make myself remember. So I want to put down these stories on paper for my kids, and I want to collect stories from other people who had personal interactions with Andrew, because I dont want them to just see the biased tidbits that are out there on the Internet, that really only capture his persona, she said.  They dont necessarily capture who he was, this whole other side of him, she maintained. He was this intense, and thoughtful, and intelligent person     but he was also, like you said, a goofball. I think you referred to him recently as just a big hairy dad. And he was that! He was so many things. He was such a good friend to so many people, and so many people who disagreed with him. He was all of those things. I want them to remember that."
"Luis Gutierrez Whines: Breitbart News Coverage of Illegal Immigrants, Muslim Refugees Too Harsh - Breitbart",Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/10/2017,"Rep. Luis Gutierrez ( ) whined about Breitbart News coverage of illegal immigrants and Muslim refugees during his recent commencement address at Cambridge College.  Breitbart and Fox News didnt invent their opinions on Mexicans and Central Americans or Muslims, he claimed the day after the London Bridge terror attacks. Theyre just recycling them.  He told Cambridge Colleges graduates, I say lift the Muslim ban and tell the Supreme Court to say its unconstitutional and  .  Gutierrez called President Donald Trump an unqualified game show host and said he saw in our country great hope and great enthusiasm for resistance against Trumps America and what it stands for.  After the London Bridge attacks, Trump called for the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety and added that we must stop being politically correct or it will only get worse.  We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety! Trump tweeted. We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we dont get smart it will only get worse.  We need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017,  We must stop being politically correct and get down to the business of security for our people. If we dont get smart it will only get worse,     Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017,  Gutierrez said when it comes to immigrants, religious and ethnic groups, whatever group is coming right now, there is always a chorus of people saying they are the wrong kind of people, they are criminal, they are disloyal, and they will ruin everything for the rest of us in America.  He said they were wrong about the Irish Catholics that fled Ireland and they are wrong about the Syrian refugee Muslims that come to America seeking a place of refuge.  He told graduates that when he was growing up, the New York Times said Puerto Ricans like his parents were bringing tropical diseases to New York and would be on welfare and lead a life of crime.  He also said there was no one to stand up for my parents, or the Chinese when they were excluded, or the Irish, or the Japanese when they were put in internment camps, or the Jews when they were turned back to certain death, or the Italians everyone made fun of.  He blasted Attorney General Jeff Sessions, claiming Sessions wants to roll back voting rights and basic civil rights and to reignite the war on drugs.  I ask you to never forget as they try to roll back voting rights and civil rights that people were murdered, churches were bombed, people were lynched, they were beaten and brutalized so we can have these voting rights and civil rights, he said. Gutierrez also claimed Sessions wants to deport as many people as possible and use the law to paint all immigrants as criminals.  He called on Trumps administration to leave illegal immigrant laborers, parents, and those working in the fields alone and go after the criminals that are in our neighborhoods, not after the decent people trying to make a better future in America.  He told the audience that he became active in politics after realizing that his fellow establishment Democrats were bigoted.  Gutierrez told the graduates that in the 1980s, Democrats in Chicago asked him to vote for a Republican candidate for mayor because the Democrat, Harold Washington, was black. After Washington won the Democratic primary, the Democratic Party of Chicago didnt like it one bit because he was black, Gutierrez said, adding that some Chicago Democrats wanted him to vote against Harold Washington because a black person might move on your block, or went to school with your kids, or maybe married your daughter or your son.  He said he was not very political at the time and just thought Washington, who would later endorse Gutierrezs candidacy for Congress, was the best person for the job. Gutierrez said these guys from the Democratic Party were proving that racism ran deep and something awoke in me.  He said he told his neighbors what racist bigots they were and urged them to not let fear and bigotry determine their votes. Gutierrez told the graduates that they will have to play a role in repairing the country from the damage that is being done today and urged them to stand up against the people who are surrounding the president and drawn from the most discredited corners of white nationalism, corporate greed   rights,   rights,       rights, and extremists who are anti almost everything that should be top tier in America.  He implied that Trump, Sessions, and White House chief strategist Steve Bannon would be uncomfortable with the different ethnicities and different languages in the crowd of different colors.  You are the flavor of America, he said. You are building a stronger America.  Gutierrez is   for his    rhetoric, histrionics, and outlandish predictions. When House Republicans passed the American Health Care Act last month, Gutierrez compared the passage of Trumpcare to Pearl Harbor, Fort Sumter, and the invasion of Iraq. Attacking Pearl Harbor, firing on Fort Sumter and invading Iraq looked like good ideas to the perpetrators at the time, Gutierrez said. But in the end, they were huge blunders that harmed America and came back to haunt those who to took those actions. That is how I see this health care vote for Republicans.  Gutierrez also predicted on the House floor in 2014 that George W. Bush would be the last Republican president if Republicans did not work with his fellow Democrats to pass a massive comprehensive amnesty bill. Two years after the bipartisan effort to ram through amnesty failed   largely because of Breitbart News relentless reporting on the matter   Trump was elected president."
Anti-Fascists Crash Nationwide Protests Against Sharia Law - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/10/2017,"Protesters campaigning against Sharia Law were met with a number of   on Saturday, as   rallies took place in 28 cities across America. [The rallies, which were organized by the national security organization ACT! for America, attracted strong support in cities such as Phoenix, Chicago, Austin, Atlanta, New York, Boston, and Seattle.  Sharia is the law of Islam, which governs how Muslims pray, eat, establish families, and all aspects of a Muslims life. The rules of sharia come from Quranic commandments and the hadiths, a collection of sayings of Muhammad. Sharia significantly restricts the freedom of women and allows for extreme punishments for violations such as adultery, blasphemy, and apostasy. Sharia is the basis of laws in Islamic countries, both Sunni and Shia. A press release from the ACT! for America website reads: This is a march against Sharia law and for human rights. Our nation is built on the freedom of religion     a pillar of our democracy     which we must always respect, protect, and honor. However many aspects of Sharia law run contrary to basic human rights and are completely incompatible with our laws and our democratic values. However, many marches were disrupted by   who accused participants of Islamaphobia and stoking hatred against Muslims. #MuslimsAreWelcomedHere being chanted pic. twitter.

OMB Top Post Nominee Berned at Stake for Christian Faith,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/10/2017,"President Donald Trumps pick for the Office of Management and Budgets deputy director post was grilled not for his budgetary principles, but for his Christian faith by former Democrat presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders.[  During a hearing of the Senate Committee on the budget this week, Sanders essentially told nominee Russell Vought that Christians are bigoted and, therefore, should not serve in public office. Sanders pointed to an article Vought wrote in January 2016 about Dr. Larycia Hawkins, a political science professor at Wheaton College, Voughts alma mater, who was placed on administrative leave after wearing a hijab to support Muslims. Hawkins had consulted with the Council on   Relations (CAIR) prior to donning the hijab. In a Facebook post, she had also suggested that Christians and Muslims worship the same God. Vought took issue with Hawkins post in a piece at the Resurgent, from which Sanders quoted. Excerpts from the exchange are as follows: Sanders: Muslims do not simply have a deficient theology. They do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ, His Son, and they stand condemned.  Do you believe that that statement is Islamophobic? Vought: Absolutely not, Senator. Im a Christian, and I believe in a Christian set of principles based on my faith. Sanders: Forgive me, we just dont have a lot of time. Do you believe people in the Muslim religion stand condemned? Is that your view? Vought: Again, Senator, Im a Christian, and I wrote that piece in accordance with the statement of faith at Wheaton College. Sanders: I understand that. I dont know how many Muslims there are in America. Maybe a couple million. Are you suggesting that these people stand condemned? What about Jews? Do they stand condemned too? Vought: Senator, Im a Christian. Sanders: I understand you are a Christian, but this country [is] made of people who are not just   I understand that Christianity is the majority religion, but there are other people of different religions in this country and around the world. In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned? Vought: Thank you for probing on that question. As a Christian, I believe that all individuals are made in the image of God and are worthy of dignity and respect regardless of their religious beliefs. I believe that as a Christian thats how I should treat all individuals. Sanders: Do you think thats respectful of other religions?        I would simply say, Mr. Chairman, that this nominee is really not someone who this country is supposed to be about. I will vote no.  In my view, the statement made by Mr. Vought is indefensible, it is hateful, it is Islamophobic, and it is an insult to over a billion Muslims throughout the world, Sanders said. This country, since its inception, has struggled, sometimes with great pain, to overcome discrimination of all forms.        We must not go backwards.  Sen. Chris Van Hollen ( ) decided Sanders line of questioning was worthy of pursuing further at the same time he denied they were attacking Voughts Christian faith. Im a Christian, but part of being a Christian, in my view, is recognizing that there are lots of ways that people can pursue their God, Van Hollen said. No one is questioning your faith.        Its your comments that suggest a violation of the public trust in what will be a very important position.  Writing at the Atlantic, Emma Green asserts, It was a remarkable moment: a Democratic senator lecturing a nominee for public office on the correct interpretation of Christianity in a confirmation hearing putatively about the Office of Management and Budget.  She continues: Article VI of the U. S. Constitution states that no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.  On Wednesday, Senator Bernie Sanders flirted with the boundaries of this rule during a confirmation hearing for Russell Vought, President Trumps nominee for deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. David French writes at National Review: This is a disgraceful and unconstitutional line of questioning from the man who came close to being the Democratic nominee for president. Hes not only imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution, hes gone so far as to label this decent man     whos seeking to serve his country in a vital role     as not someone who this country is supposed to be about.  Vought expressed entirely orthodox Christian beliefs. There is nothing extreme about his statements, and they mirror the statements of faith of countless Christian churches and schools across the land. Are these believers also not fit for public office? Ive written that Christians and Muslims dont worship the same God. I suppose that means Americas not about me, either. Family Research Council (FRC) which has launched a petition calling on Sanders to apologize for his religious bigotry, states, Our Constitution guarantees there will be no religious litmus test. Americans should never be forced to choose between their faith and public service.  Actually, Russell Vought is exactly what this country is about, FRC states. Hes exercising the belief that America was founded upon: that we are one nation, under God. The ability to voice that belief   even in the public square   is the same vision that brought the Pilgrims to America.  But after two terms of trying to drive Christianity underground, the Left isnt about to declare a cease fire, it continues. If Bernie Sanderss comments are any indication, theyre more determined than ever to wipe men and women of faith off the public service map."
"TRUMP: Comey lied about what I said, and Im 100% willing to be questioned under oath about it",Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/10/2017,"President Donald Trump suggested on Friday on that former FBI   Director James Comey lied under oath  on Thursday.     In a press conference at the White House, Trump said he didnt   say he hoped Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9, would let go   of an investigation into former national security adviser Michael   Flynn. Comey has said Trump asked him in a private meeting in   February to end that probe.     But Trump added that if he had made those comments, there would   be nothing wrong with it, according to everybody that I read   today.     Trump, speaking alongside Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in   the Rose Garden, also said he was 100% willing to testify under   oath to dispute claims Comey made before the Senate committee.     I didnt say that, Trump said of Comeys assertion. And   thered be nothing wrong with it if I did say that, according to   everybody that I read today, but I did not say that.     Trump did not make clear what he had read. Earlier Friday, he      from Alan Dershowitz, a prominent lawyer and Harvard professor,   who said there was no plausible case for obstruction of justice   and that we must distinguish crimes from political sins.     Comey also said in his testimony that Trump asked for his   loyalty during a dinner in January, but Trump insisted this was   also untrue.     I hardly know the man, Trump said. Im not going to say, I   want you to pledge allegiance.  Who would do that? Who would ask   a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean, think of it, I   hardly know the man. It doesnt make sense. No, I didnt say   that. And I didnt say the other.     Trump added that he would be glad to tell Robert Mueller, the   special counsel who is overseeing the FBIs investigation into   Russias election meddling and whether Trumps campaign played a   role, exactly what I just told you, but under oath.       Earlier Friday, Trump tweeted that Comeys testimony was a total   and complete vindication for him despite so many false   statements and lies.     He explained in the press conference why he felt vindicated by   the testimony:     Trump also addressed whether any tapes of his conversations with   Comey existed.     Trumps tweet in May that Comey had better hope that there are   no tapes drove Comey to instruct a good friend, a Columbia   University law professor, to  of his conversations with the president to the media,   Comey said. He said he did this because felt the investigation   may have reached a point at which a special counsel needed to be   appointed.     Trump and his outside attorney, Marc Kasowitz, have zeroed in on   this and lambasted Comey for ordering the leaks.     During his Thursday testimony, Comey said he hoped Trump would   produce the tapes if he had them.     On Friday, Trump said on three occasions that the media would   soon know about whether tapes existed.     Well, Ill tell you about that maybe sometime in the very near   future, he said, later adding that he was not hinting anything   about whether there were any   conversations.     I will tell you about it over a fairly short period of time, he   said. Youre going to be very disappointed when you hear the   answer.        Comeys testimony provided . Comey said he believed he was fired   because of the Russia investigation, amplifying calls that   Trump obstructed justice. He also said he took Trumps comments   about the Flynn probe as a direction.     Comey said he kept memos on his conversations with Trump     but   hadnt with two previous presidents or other top Justice   Department officials     because he was honestly concerned that he   might lie about the nature of our meeting.     Comey also said Trump and his administration tried to defame   him by spreading lies, plain and simple, about his firing. He   cited Trumps shifting explanations, which he said included   Trump saying on TV that he actually fired me because of the   Russia investigation.     But Comey did not provide any proverbial smoking gun.     As FBI director, Comey oversaw the bureaus investigation into   whether the Trump campaign colluded with Russian officials to   interfere in the 2016 presidential election.     Some top Democrats     including Sens. Chris Murphy of Connecticut,   Brian Schatz of Hawaii, and Chris Van Hollen of Maryland          to call for Trump to testify under oath before Trump brought it   up on Friday.     I called on him to do this yesterday,    after Trumps press conference. Now, lets make it happen.   Senate can send over the invite ASAP.  President Donald Trump suggested on Friday on. .."

Joe Biden encourages Mitt Romney to run for Senate,CNN,Faith Karimi,6/10/2017,"Park City, Utah  (CNN) Former Vice President Joe Biden is encouraging onetime rival Mitt Romney to return to public life and run for Senate. Biden spoke at Romneys ideas summit, an annual gathering of donors and business leaders in Utah.   During a private event Friday night in Park City, Biden called Romney a man of integrity and said he should mount a challenge next year, according to two people in the room.  By the way, you should run for Senate, one attendee quoted Biden as saying. The comment was quick and   but the crowd of Romney loyalists appreciated it and applauded. The two men were on opposite sides of the 2012 election    Biden as the running mate of President Barack Obama and Romney as the Republican presidential nominee.  Romney and Biden both considered running for president last year, but both deferred to candidates they saw as having an overwhelming financial advantage (Jeb Bush on the Republican side Hillary Clinton on the Democratic side). Biden, 74, recently launched American Possibilities PAC, a political action committee that has set off speculation about his 2020 intentions. The former senator from Delaware has made regular public appearances since leaving office, often criticizing President Donald Trump. Romney, 70, has not stayed far from politics, either.  After being passed over for Trumps secretary of state, Romney has campaigned for GOP candidates and weighed in on political matters via social media. He revealed Friday that he had been serious about serving as Trumps top diplomat and even spoke to Hillary Clinton, the defeated Democratic nominee, who encouraged him to take it. Speculation has grown that Romney could run for the Senate in Utah. But first, Republican Sen. Orrin Hatch, 83, must decide whether he wants to seek an eighth term. Romney, a former Massachusetts governor, is a Mormon and owns a home in Utah."
London Bridge attacker tried to rent larger truck,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/10/2017,"London (CNN) The ringleader of the London terror attack last week tried to rent a 7.  truck, British police have said, indicating the attackers were looking to carry out a   assault. Three men rammed into pedestrians on London Bridge on the night of June 3 before going on a stabbing spree at bars and restaurants at the nearby Borough Market. Eight people were killed and the three attackers were shot dead by police.   London Metropolitan Police said the trios ringleader, Khuram Butt, attempted to rent the large truck online on the morning of June 3 but did not provide payment details when prompted. Butt rented a white Renault van in the evening instead, using a recently activated mobile phone.  READ: London lives on, Large trucks have been used in other ramming attacks in Europe and have caused higher numbers of casualties. Mohamed Lahouaiej Bouhlel killed 86 people in Nice, France, when he plowed through a large crowd celebrating the national Bastille Day last July. In Berlin, Anis Amri rammed into a Christmas market, killing 12.  Butt out on bail at time of attack, Met Police confirmed to CNN that Butt was out on bail at the time of the attacks, having been arrested in a   fraud offense in October 2016. He wasnt charged and was about to be released from bail because of insufficient evidence, the police said.  Two British   sources told CNN that the arrest was part of a drive by British police and the MI5 intelligence agency to take known Islamist extremists off the streets by going after them for crimes unrelated to terrorism. That drive was initiated two years previously. An official involved in the efforts said the arrests focused on members of the   group al Muhajiroun and likened it to going after Al Capone for tax evasion. The police and other   agencies have come under scrutiny after it emerged that Butt was under investigation when he carried out the attack. Pink knives and Molotov cocktails, Police have released images of three pink ceramic kitchen knives found on or near the assailants. The Ernesto brand knives are 12 inches long, and were found with tape wrapped around the handles and leather straps attached to them to keep the weapons on the attackers wrists. Weve been working round the clock to understand what these men did in the   to the attack but we need to know more about these unusual knives. Where have they come from? Where might the attackers have bought them from? the Mets   command chief Dean Haydon said, calling on the public to contact police if they had any information on the weapons. Police also released photos of the van the attackers used to mow down people on the bridge. Inside, they found 13 apparent Molotov cocktails made from wine bottles and a possible flammable liquid. There also were two blowtorches.  They found a number of office chairs and a suitcase, and believe that the attackers had told family they were using the van to move as a cover story. Police said the three men    Butt, Rachid Redouane and Youssef Zaghba    had driven up and down London Bridge twice before carrying out the attack, in what appears to have been a dry run. Police have conducted a series of raids in connection with the attacks and made 18 arrests. Five people remain in custody and the other 13 have been released. In a raid of an east London apartment rented by Redouane, police found an   copy of the Koran opened at a page describing martyrdom and materials that may have been used to make the Molotov cocktails.  Police have arrested 19 people in connection with the attack. Six men are still in custody and one has been released on bail."
Mays top advisers quit after shock UK vote,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/10/2017,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May appears to have begun a purge in her party after shock election results threw the future of her leadership in doubt.  Mays   of staff, Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill, announced their resignations Saturday on the Conservative Home political blog. Timothy conceded in a statement that he had failed to carry out an effective election campaign, while Hill made no mention of her performance. May suffered a humiliating blow as the snap election Thursday spectacularly backfired, stripping her Conservative Party of its commanding majority in Parliament. She had called the vote three years earlier than required by law, with the aim of sweeping an even greater majority for her party before Brexit talks in nine days to take the country out of the European Union. Mays attempts to form a government with support from Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) appear to be taking longer than first thought. On Saturday night, Downing Street issued a statement claiming that a preliminary deal had been reached, but hours later was forced to issue a second statement clarifying that no agreement had been finalized.  The Prime Minister is also fending off a mutiny in her own party. Conservative MPs are publicly airing their anger, some calling for her ouster and others demanding radical change in her style of leadership. Several MPs have said they were angered by key points in the Conservatives manifesto, the document that outlined the partys agenda. MP says manifesto was arsenic Nigel Evans was among Conservative MPs to call for Timothys resignation, and said anyone with their fingers on the document should resign. It was absolute arsenic from beginning to end, Evans told CNN. Evans confirmed that some MPs are calling for Mays resignation, although he himself is not. But he slammed Mays style of governance as tone deaf to her own Cabinet ministers and MPs, whom he said were better in touch with voters on the ground. He said the partys commanding lead in the polls of 20 percentage points at the start of the election period dramatically narrowed after the launch of the Conservatives manifesto, which he said was   in its call for a cut funding for childrens school lunches and to charge the elderly more for their own care. The campaign was going well until the manifesto was launched. Of course, the core message was all lost because of the cacophony of noise we were making about social care, and so we were having to fight fires that we created ourselves rather than exposing the Labour Partys insane manifesto. Katie Perrior, Mays former director of communications, described an atmosphere of toxicity and intimidation by Timothy and Hill. The atmosphere would be great if the chiefs of staff were not there and terrible if the chiefs of staff were there, she told the BBCs Radio 4. We would be able to speak freely if they werent around, and if they were around, you dont speak. Another Conservative MP, Anna Soubry, told the BBC after the results came in that May has to obviously consider her position and take personal responsibility for the dreadful election campaign and deeply flawed manifesto. She also echoed comments made by Evans and Perrior that much of the party had been shut out of the campaign. It was a tightly knit group, it was her group that ran this campaign and look where we are, for Gods sake, Soubry said.  Timothy said in his statement that the election result was a huge disappointment. I take responsibility for my part in this election campaign, which was the oversight of our policy program, he said. Though he refuted reports he was responsible for the elderly care policy, saying it was the subject of many months of work among many people. I want to place on record my sorrow for the Conservative Members of Parliament who lost their seats, several of whom are close friends. Hill described May as an excellent Prime Minister in her resignation statement. I have no doubt at all that Theresa May will continue to serve and work hard as Prime Minister    and do it brilliantly. Backlash over controversial alliance, May is now looking to rule the country with less than 50% of seats in Parliaments House of Commons, and is banking on support from the DUP to be the ally that helps her party push its agenda through Parliament.  Contrary to an earlier statement which suggested May had reached a preliminary deal with the DUP, Downing Street said Saturday that such a deal had yet to be finalized.  The Prime Minister has tonight spoken with the DUP to discuss finalizing a confidence and supply deal when Parliament returns next week, the statement said.  We will welcome any such deal being agreed, as it will provide the stability and certainty the whole country requires as we embark on Brexit and beyond. The DUP meanwhile said that discussion will continue into next week to work on the details and to reach agreement on arrangements for the new Parliament. Mays courting of DUP has triggered criticism in the media and among members of her party, who have described DUP as   and regressive on LGBTI rights. Ruth Davidson, a Conservative in Scotland, told the BBC she had words with May over the DUPs record on LGBT rights. I asked for a categoric assurance that if any deal or scoping deal was done with the DUP there would be absolutely no rescission of LGBTI rights in the rest of the UK, in Great Britain, and that we would use any influence that we had to advance LGBTI rights in Northern Ireland, said the MP, who is a lesbian. Its an issue very close to my heart and one that I wanted categoric assurances from the Prime Minister on, and I received [them]. Pressure is now also coming from the public. A petition on Change. org had more than half a million signatures by Saturday afternoon, calling for Mays resignation over her alliance with the DUP.  There have been few clues as to how May might shake up her administration, but the Prime Minister, who campaigned under the mantra strong and stable, announced that she would retain five key Cabinet ministers in their posts. Scathing media response, May came under fire during the campaign for the controversial policy on the cost of care for the elderly, dubbed the dementia tax, and for making several   on social care. She was criticized for refusing to take part in a televised leaders debate and for carefully controlling her campaign activities to keep the public at arms length. She was forced to apologize after she refused to acknowledge her partys battering in her initial   remarks. The British media has been scathing of May. The Times newspaper ran a   story on Mays tenuous future as Conservative leader Saturday with the headline May stares into the abyss. The Daily Mirror tabloids cover read Coalition of Crackpots, playing on the term Coalition of Chaos that May had used to describe the opposition parties. And the Sun tabloid led with Shes had her chips, pointing to a campaign moment of May awkwardly eating fries, while implying she was on the way out."
Kamala Harris-Leftist Senator From California and Next Democratic Star - Breitbart,Breitbart,Samuel Chi,6/10/2017,"Kamala Harris, Californias freshman senator and former state attorney general, has been quite the newsmaker in her short five months on Capitol Hill. Shes been dropping   told to stop harassing witnesses at hearings, and staking her ground as the most   lawmaker in Washington. [Her face has been plastered all over newspaper front pages and TV screens. While she has become the darling of the progressive left, Harris is now among the most loathsome figures for conservatives or anyone who supports President Trumps agenda. There is now rampant speculation that shes gearing up for a 2020 presidential run, even though for now she denies it.  But just exactly who is Kamala Harris? For all the noise shes making now in Washington, Harris, 52, actually has a relatively low profile in much of her own state. Her political rise has been groomed by the states Democratic machine, which is now akin to a monarchical procession in   rule California. Born to an Indian mother and a Jamaican father, Harris upbringing was that of a typical leftist. She was raised in Berkeley and grew up in academic circles of her mother after her parents divorce. She attended Howard University in Washington, D. C. and earned her law degree from Hastings in San Francisco, though she failed her bar exam on the first try. Harris big break in her political career came after dating Willie Brown, a powerful former California Assembly speaker and mayor of San Francisco. She became the District Attorney of San Francisco before running and narrowly winning the race for state attorney general in 2010 in an election that was possibly tainted by voter fraud and wasnt decided until nearly three weeks later. After she became the state AG, her eventual ascension was mapped out. She was to become the next senator from California after the retirement of Barbara Boxer. Harris won the 2016 senate race easily, defeating Loretta Sanchez with more than 60 percent of the vote in an   contest. Harris platform was that of the boilerplate progressive left, championing the climate change agenda, increasing the federal minimum wage, renewing the ban on assault weapons, and providing aid for illegal aliens while shielding them from federal agents. But after being accused of being too low key and risk averse during much of her political career in California, Harris has adopted a different persona after arriving in Washington. She intentionally dropped an   at a public event discussing health care, voted against 32 of 38 of President Trumps nominees, and then last week earned a rebuke from her senate colleagues when she endlessly interrupted both Department of Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein during hearings. All these moves were designed to raise her profile among Democrats, who are bereft of talent to run on a national ticket. Harris presents a younger, sassier, and   version of the   models of Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. The dominant trend in Democratic Party politics is fresh, new, and interesting     thats what people are looking for     not old, steady, and establishment, Wade Randlett, a longtime Democratic fundraiser in Silicon Valley who has known Harris for years, told Politico. And Kamala is the trifecta on that.  Of course, being a progressive favorite may help Harris in the Democratic field, with a race seemingly on to determine who might be the loudest and most obnoxious. But will that play well in middle America? For now, the Democrats dont care. They see nothing wrong with backing a political climber whos thin on accomplishments. They just see another Barack Obama. Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political analyst at USC, told Politico that Harris faces particular pressure to perform among Democrats because she is perceived as a part of this new generation of leadership.  As a senator of   and   heritage, she is a woman of color, a diverse ethnicity, and one with powerful friends like Obama, who enthusiastically endorsed her senate bid. You have to be careful to, first of all, say she is brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough, Obama said of Harris during a 2013 fundraiser. She also happens to be, by far, the best looking attorney general in the country.  Of course, even Obama had to apologize for that remark, the last part.

[Caroline Biden, 30, took a plea deal at the Manhattan Supreme Court in New York City and pleaded guilty to stealing $110, 810 with a borrowed credit card to go on a shopping spree, the New York Post reported.  In exchange for a guilty plea, a judge sentenced Caroline to two years probation under the condition that she stay out of trouble and pay back the money she stole. Her attorneys declined to comment on the plea. Bidens niece asked to borrow a credit card from the unnamed victim so she could make a $672 purchase. Instead, Caroline opened an account at Bigelow Pharmacy in New York and spent over $100, 000 on store purchases from April 2015 to June 24, 2016. Police arrested Caroline May 5 and charged her with grand and petit larceny. She pleaded guilty to both charges Friday.

Lena Dunham: Disastrous for Women Not to Have Free Birth Control - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/10/2017,"In an   in the New York Times, actress Lena Dunham says President Donald Trumps draft of a plan to roll back Obamacares contraception mandate will be disastrous for some women, jeopardizing their ability to work and provide for their families. [ My @nytimes   on the proposed birth control coverage rollbacks is in print and online now. Women should have access to any kind of contraception they want, any time they want, without pushback from their employers or insurers. But what about the fact that hormonal BC keeps many of us healthy, in the work force and out of this position? We have the power to let our representatives know that enough is enough. We are the NO LONGER SILENT majority. Link in bio, take action. And yeah, I am this extra hot every time Im in an ER with pelvic pain  A post shared by Lena Dunham (@lenadunham) on Jun 10, 2017 at 5:37am PDT,   Amid a detailed description of her own gynecological problems     i. e. between 1998 and last week, Ive been to the emergency room over 50 times with   pain     Dunham criticizes any change that would allow some religious employers     such as the Little Sisters of the Poor     the freedom not to provide contraception,   drugs, and sterilization procedures for employees through health insurance plans because of their faith beliefs. She asserts more women are being prescribed birth control pills for a variety of medical problems than for contraception. Birth control pills are many womens method of choice for preventing unintended pregnancy and should be covered by all insurance policies for that reason alone, she writes, but then adds that millions of women living with endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cystic acne, migraines, uterine abnormalities and a history of ectopic pregnancies, birth control can be a crucial, even lifesaving, medical treatment.  She continues: If the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress succeed in stripping funding from Planned Parenthood and giving employers carte blanche to deny women necessary medication under murky notions of moral disdain, all paths to health and wellness will disappear for a huge swath of Americans. While the teachings of the Catholic Church, for example, are in conflict with the use of artificial birth control, the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops states, Catholic teaching does not oppose the use of hormonal medications     such as those found in chemical contraceptives     for legitimate medical purposes, provided there is no contraceptive intent.  The bishops continue, however: But artificial hormones typically treat only the medical symptoms. They do not correct the underlying disease or condition. They also carry the same physical health risks as hormonal contraceptives. Thankfully, with growing advancements in understanding fertility, knowledgeable gynecologists can often prescribe   drugs and recommend safer and healthier treatments to correct underlying problems or eliminate discomfort. Like many on the left, Dunham is propping up Planned Parenthood, whose days of being on the receiving end of taxpayer dollars may be numbered. Trump has said he will defund Planned Parenthood if the organization continues to perform abortions. The group, however, showed, in its latest annual report, that it is performing even more abortions and providing less contraception services     all while its taxpayer funding has increased. In   Planned Parenthood reports performing 328, 348 abortions     an increase of 4, 349 abortions over the 323, 999 abortions the group states it performed in  . The organization also reported 2, 945, 059 contraception services in   and 2, 808, 815 of the same services in its latest report, a drop of 136, 244 within a year. With regard to its revenue, the new report shows Planned Parenthoods total revenue to be $1, 354. 3 million, an increase over the $1, 296. 1 million reported in  . The organization shows an increase in government reimbursement and grants this year, reporting $554. 6 million in taxpayer funding, while in   it reported $553. 7 million. Planned Parenthood reported an Excess in Revenue Over Expenses of $58. 8 million in  . That amount rose to $77. 5 million this past year. The fact is, until former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius bureaucratically inserted the HHS mandate into Obamacare, employers were never entangled in their employees sex lives and decisions as to when to have a child. Once she did, and   groups objected, bosses became an easy target for radical feminists. Many women in Congress are supporting the draft of the HHS contraception mandate rollback. Obamacare has devastated religious organizations, schools, and businesses, forcing them to cover   services that violate their religious beliefs, says Rep. Diane Black ( ) adding: Protecting religious liberty is a foundational principle of this country, and this draft rule is a victory against President Obamas assault on people of faith nationwide. Americans will no longer have to seek a burdensome exemption from the heavy hand of government, they will be left alone to practice their religion as they choose. Rep. Vicky Hartzler ( ) says the draft provides important exemptions for organizations with religious or moral objections to the HHS mandate.  In other words, religious charities like the Little Sisters of the Poor,   universities,   businesses, and individuals with moral objections will now be able to provide employees with health care policies consistent with their conscience and the organizations mission, she continued. The previous administrations   approach went out of its way to force a mandate that violates the faith and ethical sensibilities of the American public."
Byron York: Five Notes on Trumps Current Predicament - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/10/2017,"In an   for The Washington Examiner, Byron York pinpoints and breaks down the challenges facing President Donald Trump following fired FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee. Note One     the newly configured foundation beneath the     matter: Its not about collusion any more. Fired FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee marked the full shift of the   investigation from a probe dedicated to discovering collusion to a probe dedicated to proving the president obstructed justice. (See At this rate, it wont matter if Trump colluded with Russia. ) Democrats at the Comey hearing barely touched on collusion, which appears to have turned out to be a dry hole. When it did come up in Comeys appearance, it was during questioning from Republicans, who wanted to highlight their point that collusion     the core of the case and the reason everybody got so excited in the first place     has so far turned out to be nothing. To Democrats, that no longer matters. Now, its all about obstruction of justice, or alleged obstruction of justice, or fantasized obstruction of justice, depending on your partisan perspective. Senate Democrats focused almost exclusively on obstruction in their questioning of Comey, and their House counterparts are sure to do the same. As far as the Justice Department investigation of the president is concerned, we know that as of the time Comey was fired on May 9, there was no investigation of the president concerning collusion, which strongly suggests that after 10 months of probing, authorities had nothing against him on that issue. Now, however, after the Comey memos and the Comey firing, it seems safe to predict that special counsel Robert Mueller will investigate Trump for obstruction. So it is a new game, even if Republicans keep trying to play the old one. 2. Trump failed to take the threat against him seriously, Here is a simple fact: Many of Trumps most determined adversaries do not want just to defeat him on Obamacare, although they want that, too. They do not want just to defeat him on taxes, although they want that, too. They do not want just to stop the border wall, although they want that, too. No, they do not want just to defeat him     they want to remove him from office."

Mark Levin: CNN Is Destroying the First Amendment - Jake Tapper Is Evil - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/10/2017,"Friday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Mark Levin, author of the forthcoming book Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism, read from a Federalist piece by Ben Domenech laying out how Domenech viewed CNNs war on President Donald Trump.  Domenech argued CNN was sacrificing balance and centrism in its quest against Trump. Levin agreed with Domenechs findings but took it a step further by declaring that CNN was destroying the First Amendment and that Trump was right to say the media are evil in some circumstances and singled out CNNs Jake Tapper. You can see how CNN has changed its coverage, Levin said. CNN is at war with Trump. CNN is violating     CNN is destroying the First Amendment and freedom of the press. And when Jake Tapper says, How dare President [Trump] call us evil? Jake, youre evil. Youre unconscionable. All of you     because you know exactly what youre doing. You dont care.  Later in the segment, Levin argued there was more truthful reporting on Russia TV than CNN, adding that he had never watched Russia TV before. I think you get more truthful reporting on Russia TV, which I have never watched in my life, than you get on CNN, he added. How do I know? Because you dont get truthful reporting on CNN. And you know what youre getting on Russia TV. They call themselves Russia TV. Oh     must be about Russia or something, Russia TV.

Hannity: James Comey Humiliated the Mainstream Press With His Testimony - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/10/2017,"Friday during his   segment on Fox News Channels Hannity, host Sean Hannity declared former FBI Director James Comey humiliated the media.  Hannity, referring to Comey as J. Edgar Comey, pointed to parts of Comeys testimony debunking reports of Trump   collusion. Watch: Transcript as follows: So in a shocking turn of events, one of the biggest losers from yesterdays   Comey testimony was the   propaganda media. Were going to break down just how James Comey humiliated the mainstream press and why they are now facing a massive credibility crisis in tonights  . So yesterday, the former FBI director James Comey, J. Edgar Comey, told the Senate Intel Committee that many of the medias Russian collusion stories are just dead wrong. Watch this. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) JAMES COMEY, FORMER FBI DIRECTOR: There have been many, many stories partly based on classified information about lots of stuff but especially about Russia that are just dead wrong. The challenge, and I am not picking on reporters, about writing stories about classified information is the people talking about it often dont really know whats going on. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Now after that testimony, even Mr. Thrill up his left Chris Matthews, he himself came to this stunning conclusion. I was even shocked. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) CHRIS MATTHEWS, MSNBC HOST: The assumption of the critics of the president, of his pursuers you might say, is that somewhere along the line in the last years the president had something to do with colluding with the Russians, something to do, a helping hand, encouraging them, feeding their desire to affect the election in some way, some role they played, some conversation he had with Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort or somewhere. And yet what came apart this morning was that theory. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: Pursuers.  Now, the black helicopter crowd, the tinfoil hat Russia conspiracy theories being pushed by the media, the   media, have now come apart at the seams. Now, its all been wrong. They have been lying to you, the American people. Of course, MSNBC was not the only outlet having to backtrack. The Hill is reporting that, quote, CNN issues correction after Comeys statement contradicts their reporting.  And even ABC was also forced to update a story following Comeys remarks. And then, of course, there is the paper of record,   paper record, The New York Times. They were singled out yesterday for being flat out wrong, I would argue again. Take a look. (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That report by The New York Times was not true. Is that a fair statement? COMEY: In the main, it was not true. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: On February 14, The New York Times published a story the headline of which was Trump campaign aides had repeated contacts with Russian intelligence.  You were asked earlier if that was an inaccurate story and you said: in the main.  Would it be fair to characterize that story is almost entirely wrong? COMEY: Yes. (END VIDEO CLIP) HANNITY: The New York Times are desperately trying to save face, fist issuing a tweet that reads, quote We are looking into James Comeys statements, and we will report back with more information as soon as we can.  And then later, publishing a full article entitled Comey disputes New York Times article about Russia investigation, where they tepidly stood by their reporting and openly wondered why Comey rebuked their coverage. I guess we wont be holding our breath for a full retraction or apology. So despite some widespread embarrassment for all these people in the   media following the Comey testimony, do think we can ever expect them to stop spreading their fake news? In other words, land the black helicopters and get back to reality? Or will the crisis and credibility continue to grow? Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
"Top Ex-Clinton Pollster: Dems Losing Working-Class Voters of ALL Races Due to Illegal Immigration, Trade - Breitbart",Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/10/2017,"Former President Bill Clintons top pollster acknowledged that Democrats have been losing   voters of all races and backgrounds   not just solely white   voters   because the partys elites support open borders, are soft on illegal immigration, and favor trade deals that screw American workers.  Stan Greenberg   who has written extensively about the importance of   Reagan Democrats in places like Macomb County, Michigan   declared that Democrats do not just have a white   problem.  Writing in the American Prospect, Greenberg notes that Democrats have lost support with all   voters across the electorate, including the Rising American Electorate of minorities, unmarried women, and millennials because of the partys seeming embrace of multinational trade agreements that have cost American jobs.  In addition, he says Democrats have moved from seeking to manage and champion the nations growing immigrant diversity to seeming to champion immigrant rights over those of American citizens. This decline contributed mightily to the Democrats losses in the states and Congress and to the election of Donald Trump, he says, noting that Democrats have failed to attack a political economy that works for the rich, big corporations, and the cultural elites, but not for average Americans.  Voters, Greenberg points out, are worried about the costs that come with massive immigration, with 60 percent believing that granting legal status to illegal immigrants would lead to greater competition for public services and more than half believe it would take jobs from American citizens.  He points out that even a whopping 41 percent of Democrats think those immigrants would take jobs from U. S. citizens and half of Democrats believe granting legal status would be a drain on government services.  In the 2016 election, Trump hammered Clinton among white   voters, winning their voters by nearly 40 percentage points. Though   class men were most opposed to illegal immigration, Greenberg curiously reveals the inconvenient truth that Democrats should not assume that African Americans do not share some of those concerns for many in our focus groups raise anxieties about competition from new immigrants.  In addition, he says, like the more conservative   whites, African American women place a high premium on faith in God and the need to put American citizens before immigrants.  During the 2016 election, Jamelle Bouie acknowledged that it would not be a bad play for Trump to appeal to black workers with an immigration agenda that favors American workers. And Hillary Clintons support for amnesty programs may have turned off enough black voters to make Trump president. According to the Census, black Americans showed the sharpest decline in voter turnout    7. 1 percent since 2012. At 59. 6 percent, it was the lowest black turnout rate since 2000.  Immigration may have also arguably been the reason that propelled trump to the GOP nomination. As Breitbart News    Joel Pollak has pointed out, on July 10, 2015, nine days after an illegal immigrant murdered Kate Steinle in San Francisco, Trump met with victims of illegal immigrant crime. Trump was in seventh then, trailing former Florida Governor Jeb Bush by 10 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics average of the polls. Nine days later, Trump rocketed into first place in the RealClearPolitics average and never looked back. Another Greenberg survey a month into Trumps presidency found how central concerns about immigration, borders, foreignness, and Islam were to white   Trump voters in Macomb County, Michigan who had previously voted for Obama. These voters were convinced that Clinton and todays Democrats wanted open borders, according to his surveys. Democrats have also been losing   voters because of trade. Greenberg notes that separation grew wider with Obamas battle for the   Partnership and with Trump making his opposition to it central to his vow to represent the forgotten Americans.  The Obama presidency produced a partisan realignment on trade, reinforcing the class and gender bases of the two parties that will disrupt the politics of both, if it hasnt already, he wrote. Before 2008, Republicans were more supportive of NAFTA than Democrats, but at the end of Obamas presidency, GOP support for NAFTA collapsed, pushed off the cliff by Trump. Democrats, on the other hand, became more favorably disposed to NAFTA.  His surveys have discovered that the white working class, who live amid the remains of the manufacturing sector in the industrial Midwest, strongly oppose these trade agreements with increasing ferocity, particularly the men who were disproportionately employed in manufacturing.  During the 2016 campaign, Trump relentlessly opposed the   Partnership (TPP) deal and called out Clinton for waffling on it and never giving a clear answer about where she stood. One of Trumps first actions as president was signing an executive order formally withdrawing the United States from the TPP. Greenberg also points out that   Americans of all backgrounds pulled back from Democrats in this last period of Democratic governance because of Obamas insistence on heralding economic progress and the bailout of the irresponsible elites, while ordinary peoples incomes crashed and they continued to struggle financially.  Interestingly, according to Greenberg, Obamas embrace of policies favored by elites who live in the countrys wealthiest zip codes did the party no favors with minority voters, who have been left behind in liberal cities like San Francisco and New York. That is why the simple embrace of metropolitan Americas liberal values and economic elite hurt Democrats with   voters in both the big cities and in rural America, he notes."
Elon Musk: SpaceX may launch its biggest and most powerful rocket in 3 months,Business Insider,Dave Mosher,6/10/2017,"Elon Musk has broken some tantalizing news about the biggest   rocket ever built by his company SpaceX.     If the tech moguls plans hold, the new launch system, called   Falcon Heavy, could lift off for the first time in just a few   months.     The new    rocket would combine the power of three   smaller Falcon 9 rockets, using all 27 rocket engines to generate   more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff.     Thats enough oomph to put about 119, 000 pounds, or a fully   loaded 737 jet, into orbit. The new rocket could also send a   small spaceship, two passengers, and other gear to the moon,   totaling about   the mass that NASAs  moon rocket .     In fact, a privately funded  is exactly what Musk hopes to pull   off before the end of 2018.     Musks response on Thursday to a Twitter users question about   the   system included the most specific and      timing yet for the Falcon Heavys first launch:     tttAll Falcon Heavy cores should be at the Cape in two to three months, so launch should happen a month after thattt    Theres reason to be skeptical that Falcon Heavy will launch on   time, however, since Musk has been known to miss deadlines and   underestimate the difficulty of his endeavors.     For example, Falcon Heavy was originally supposed to launch for   the first time . But an    in September, followed by a  and a temporary   on   launches, pushed the giant rockets inaugural launch back to the   third quarter of 2017.     But if SpaceX can pull off the launch, calling it a big   advancement for spaceflight would be an understatement.        To blast off its Falcon Heavy rocket, SpaceX will strap  to the side of a   new central rocket core.     After launch, the two side rockets would peel off and attempt to   land themselves at Cape Canaveral, Florida, so they could be   refurbished and reused for yet another launch.     The central core would continue flying for a little while and   then detach from an   rocket, which would blast a   payload into orbit. The core would then fall back toward Earth,   land on a drone ship in the Atlantic Ocean, and also be recovered   for reuse.     Nearly all rocket parts in history have fallen back to Earth as   garbage. Musk hopes to break that expensive tradition by   repeatedly launching, landing, and reusing his rocket parts. His   hope is to reduce the  hundredfold and,   later on, .     Musk is the first to admit his plans are highly ambitious.     We will probably fly something really silly on Falcon Heavy   because it is quite a   mission, Musk said in March   after the successful launch of the  which was the first to reuse a   Falcon 9 booster.     The tech mogul hasnt said what that silly payload might be, but   his company did once .  Elon Musk has broken some tantalizing news. .."

Pal Who Leaked Memo Breaks Silence to Tell MSM Comey Can Dunk Basketball - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/10/2017,"Columbia University Law School professor Daniel Richman reportedly went into hiding this week after former FBI director James Comey revealed that he gave his contemporaneous memo of his interactions with President Donald Trump to Richman and asked Richman to leak it to the New York Times.  But Richman broke his silence to tell establishment media outlet Newsweek to confirm that Comey could in fact       dunk a basketball. After Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, a Newsweek writer was curious about whether the    Comey could actually dunk a basketball. In a quest for answers, I got ahold of Columbia University professor Daniel Richman   who as of Thursday is known to many as the Comey friend who leaked to the press the former FBI directors memo about conversations with Trump   to get his quick thoughts on his associates ability to stuff the rock on a regulation rim, the Newsweek reporter wrote for the outlets Friday evening story. He got in touch with Richman, who told him that Comey dunked when he turned 50 and does not plan to make another attempt until he is 60.  It is quite possible that some close to [Comey] will try to derail this plan, Richman reportedly added in an email. There are many questions government officials would like Richman to answer. As Breitbart News reported, chairs and ranking Democrats of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its National Security Subcommittee     sent a letter Thursday to Richman demanding he provide them with the original memo.  But thanks to legacy media outlet Newsweek, the world now does not have to wonder whether Comey can dunk."
"Colombia is closing in on the leaders of its biggest gang, but theyre retaliating by copying Pablo Escobar",Business Insider,Christopher Woody,6/10/2017,"Colombias peace process with the   rebel group   Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, is stumbling   forward.     FARC rebels recently announced they had  of   their weapons, but the deadline for those turnovers, originally   the end of May, has been    because of construction delays and other issues hindering the   demobilization process.     As the FARC leaves the battlefield, a number of problems have   cropped up.     Production of coca, the main ingredient in cocaine, is up   considerably . Violence in  of   the country has continued or increased as well, as criminal   groups and dissident rebel factions    of territory vacated by the FARC.     The Colombian government has tried to crack down on the groups   driving the killing, but theyve put police and the military   under fire in a style reminiscent of Pablo Escobar, adding to the   body count.     Chief among those groups is Los Urabeos, also known as the Gulf   clan, the most powerful of  and likely the only one   .     Colombia has  to scour northwest Colombia, often in Black Hawk   helicopters. The government says its closing in on the groups      leader, Dario Antonio Usuga, aka Otoniel, who   reportedly has to change locations .   (Otoniel, however, has eluded capture for years.)        We have him within striking distance, Jose Angel Mendoza, head   of the   police division,  earlier   this month. He has had to run for it at the last second, more   than once.     Colombian officials have dropped leaflets offering a reward for   information about Otoniel from helicopters over northwestern   Antioquia, the gangs home turf whose capital, Medellin, was   .     The US State Department has offered a    based on a 2009 indictment in a New York court, calling Los   Urabeos            But Los Urabeos is fighting back.     Taking a page from Escobars playbook, the gang     responsible for      production in Colombia, which produced 646 metric tons of the   drug in 2015     is targeting the police, cutting down officers in   the streets in a campaign reminiscent of Escobars vicious fight   against the state in the early 1990s.     Targeted killings of police date back to March, and have been    in part   to the National Liberation Army, another   rebel group   present in the country.     Los Urabeos appears to be responsible for many of the more   recent police killings. During May, Los Urabeos gave out   leaflets  and   officials believe the   group is offering  for   each death. Police  the   killings are in retaliation for   action against   the group.     Eleven police    throughout May, most of them on patrol. The killings have taken   place around the country but mainly in the north around Antioquia   and along the Panamanian border.     The killing spree has been compared to the , a   campaign devised by Escobar to put pressure on the government in   the early 1990s. Even the governor of Antioquia,       By   the end of 1992, Escobar upped the ante by offering  for   Medellin cops.     Not content with shootings, Escobar ; a massive one exploded outside a stadium in the city   on December 2, killing 10 police and three civilians. At the end   of the month, authorities found another massive car bomb outside   the national polices provincial headquarters.     By the time Escobar himself was gunned down in December 1993,   hundreds of Colombian police had been slain.     In Colombia, every time a criminal group turns to killing   police, they do it as a desperate measure, Vice President Oscar   Naranjo, who battled the nations drug cartels as national police   chief,  in May.        State pressure on Los Urabeos has intensified as well. In late   May, the national police reported  of the gang who were involved in police killings.     Around the same time, Colombian authorities reported capturing a   gang leader known as El Boyaco, who is  the campaign against police.     While Escobar was not a rebel or an insurgent, his campaign did   have the political objective of getting the government to relent   in its efforts to capture or kill his cartels members and to   secure an agreement not to extradite them to the US. The FARC,   both insurgents and traffickers, had designs on remaking   Colombias political system.        Los Urabeos dont appear to have aspirations for their deadly   campaign beyond getting the police off their backs.     Unlike what we have seen in the past, these groups dont have   defined political objectives, Jorge Restrepo, director of the   Conflict Analysis Resource Center in Bogota, .     Despite police success in capturing or killing its leaders,   however, the gang appears to be    in Colombias prime trafficking territory, and continued seizures   of large quantities of cocaine     like 6 metric tons of it seized   in April in what was then Colombias      indicate the gang still has the ability to move vast   amounts of the drugs.

China could stop North Koreas nuclear threat in a heartbeat without firing a shot,Business Insider,Alex Lockie,6/10/2017,"Chinese President Xi Jinping has assured US President Donald   Trump that China has limited influence over North Korea, but   thats only half true.     Its true that diplomatic relations between the two are weak. Xi   has never visited Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang, and Kim has never   been to Beijing.   officials with ties to China in   North Korea have been executed at Kims order, sometimes with   packs of dogs, sometimes with   guns.     But Gordon Chang, the author of The Coming Collapse of China,    that 90% of North Koreas trade is   done with China, accounting for 90% of its oil and, in some   years, 100% of its aviation fuel.     After a provocative North Korean missile launch in 2003, China   cut off its supply of oil to North Korea for three days. In no   time, the Kim regime caved to international demands and sat down   for the   talks on nuclear disarmament.     China can disarm North Korea in the blink of an eye, Chang   wrote.     And it could do so by crippling North Koreas economy     but at a   huge cost to North Koreans.     Sanctions on North Korea do not affect regular trade. Although   the UN takes very seriously the prospect of an aggressive,     North Korea, economic warfare in the form of     sanctions would harm or kill civilians     China also   supplies at least a third of North Koreas food, according to   Chang.     Additionally, China pressing North Korea to the point of regime   collapse would contradict its interests, as Beijing doesnt want   to face a strong, democratic, unified Korea on its border that   could play host to US military installations.        But North Korea, with its incessant nuclear provocations and   nearly weekly missile tests, functions as a giant bull  for   the US, though any military confrontation would run a high risk   of going nuclear and killing hundreds of thousands, if not more.     China will either decide to help us with North Korea or they   wont, Trump said in an April interview with the .   If they do, that will be very good for China, and if they dont,   it wont be good for anyone.

"Sanders to faithful: Take down Trump, take over Democratic Party",CNN,Gregory Krieg,6/10/2017,"Chicago (CNN) Bernie Sanders permanent political revolution rolled into Chicago on Saturday night, as the Vermont senator called on progressive activists gathered here to beat back President Donald Trumps agenda while remaking the Democratic Party. Speaking to a crowd of buzzing supporters in former President Barack Obamas adopted hometown, Sanders ripped Trumps incredible hypocrisy and called the President a demagogue who makes even a very conservative president like George W. Bush appealing in comparison. But it was his unsparing assessment of the party whose nomination he sought in 2016 that set off an audience of nearly 4, 000 mostly dedicated Berniecrats. I am often asked by the media and others, How did it come about that Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in the modern history of our country, won the election?  he offered teasingly as chants of Bernie would have won filled the hall. My answer is that Trump didnt win the election, the Democratic Party lost the election, Sanders said, reviving his own past criticisms.  Its a line hes used before, but this was a night for the old hits, and Sanders moved through his laundry list of issues over the course of nearly 55 minutes alone on stage before being joined by wife Jane Sanders and RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, the events union organizers, for a      session. Sanders was interrupted repeatedly throughout his remarks by applause and standing ovations, but also by supporters in red waving Draft Bernie banners and placards. The group wants Sanders to leave the Democratic mix and form his own Peoples Party ahead of the 2020 elections. The speech came nearly a year after the final contest in the Democratic primary that launched his political revolution, and in what many here consider the validating glow of a British election that saw leftist Jeremy Corbyns Labour party score massive gains in the UK Parliament.     They won those seats, Sanders said of Labour, not by moving to the right, not by becoming more conciliatory    they won those seats by standing (up) to the ruling class of the UK. Lamenting Republican control of not just Washington but in state legislatures, Sanders said the current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure. His prescription for the party was fundamental change and to knock on every damn door in search of new votes, even in historically inhospitable regions.  Strong progressives could do far, far better than anyone imagined and . .. with proper organization and financial resources we can win in any district in the United States of America, Sanders said, a clear shot at party leaders who have been criticized on the left over a perceived lack of support for upstart congressional candidates in Montana and Kansas. Sanders also took a series of stinging shots at Trump, labeling him perhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country and a habitual liar. He argued that the Republicans populist campaign pitch was a deception, a Trojan horse that opened the White House doors to a parade of plutocrats. This is a man who ran for president, telling the people of this country that he was going to stand up for the working class, that he was going to stand up to the political establishment and then, once he got elected and without a seconds hesitation he brings more billionaires into his administration than any president in history, Sanders said as the audience booed. And he hires the former president of Goldman Sachs to be his chief economic adviser. This is the second annual Peoples Summit, which is again being hosted in the sprawling McCormick Place convention center on Lake Michigan. Sanders did not speak at or attend the June 2016 gathering. As DeMoro took the stage following his remarks, she looked out and stopped to thank all the Draft Bernie people. I am with you, she said, and crowd erupted again."
Sanders allies emboldened by Labours gains,CNN,Gregory Krieg,6/10/2017,"Chicago (CNN) As it became clear late Thursday that UK Prime Minister Theresa Mays electoral gambit had fallen flat, and that her Conservatives majority in Parliament had been leveled by a resurgent Labour party, progressives in the US climbed on the shoulders of their transatlantic allies and celebrated a result already stoking ambitions at home. Labour and its leader Jeremy Corbyn ran a sterling   campaign after May in   with Brexit negotiations looming, called for an early general election    and with it an opportunity to press her advantage over what was seen to be a reeling opposition. But it turned out be a historical miscalculation. Labour flipped the script, netting about 30 seats as the UK was faced with a hung parliament. May is expected keep power, for now, but only with the backing of Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party. Back in the US, progressives gathering here in Chicago for a weekend convention called The Peoples Summit, a   meeting of activists and organizers that will welcome Sen. Bernie Sanders as its keynote speaker on Saturday night, rejoiced at Labours unexpected profit. Corbyn, a leftist whose campaign and platform Sanders applauded during a recent trip to the UK, is viewed by many of the Vermont senators supporters as the British Bernie. Corbyns success in confounding the British pundit class and skeptical Labour officials, many of whom openly worried over an electoral wipeout, has energized American liberal diehards now locked in a battle for control of the spirit and machinery of the Democratic party. Sanders touted the results on Twitter Friday morning, and in an email later told CNN he was delighted to see Labour do so well. Larry Cohen, the board chair of Our Revolution, the political organization spawned by Sanders 2016 primary campaign, said the British shocker held lessons for skeptical Democrats. Labours surge shows that progressive populism is a powerful political response to a global economy dominated by bankers and billionaires, Cohen wrote in an email. Bernie 2016 and Our Revolution have proven that this model is just as important here as it is in the UK. After a bruising primary campaign that exposed rifts among Democrats that deepened in the aftermath of Hillary Clintons defeat last November, many of Sanders supporters have also taken the opportunity over the past 24 hours to cast Corbyns strong showing as further proof that, as their saying goes, Bernie would have won. The phrase, a meme that serves as a love note to Sanders and mocks the argument that he was unelectable in 2016 (it is also frequently used to troll Clinton supporters) flooded social media as it became clear that Labour was on its way to serious gains. Moumita Ahmed, founder of Millennials for Revolution, told CNN in Chicago that to see (Corbyn) succeed felt like a success to us. It invigorates us to continue to work. We are trying to bring the Democratic Party back to being a party for the people, she said. Bernie Sanders and now Jeremy Corbyn. We know what were doing. We have ammo now. I was refreshing (the results) every five seconds last night, said Kelly Collison, a   activist who established Michigan for Bernie months before he entered the primary in 2015. Its what Im hoping will happen here in America. Corbyn is the kind of guy that got people excited and activated. Not everyone is as excited, Even as the grassroots buzzed, more experienced organizers sounded a cautious note.  Corbyn is not going to become the next prime minister, at least according to the current math. Democratic leaders, meanwhile, are unlikely to cede much power to the insurgent American left, instead viewing the triumph of moderate liberal technocrats in France and Canada    both closer philosophically to former President Barack Obama than Sanders    as the more appealing international parallel. Former Sanders campaign digital organizing director Claire Sandberg emailed her concerns from the UK, as she made her way to the Midwest after a whirlwind spell supporting   groups ahead of the vote.    I fully expect Establishment Democrats to reject the obvious lessons from Corbyns historic campaign, she wrote. Changing course and embracing the new,   left politics would mean alienating the big money interests that keep them afloat personally    and also admitting that all their basic assumptions about the world might be wrong. Clearly, as the   anniversary of the last Democratic primary contest nears, this latest clash among competing factions on the left and      hardly a recent or American invention    is showing few signs of a nearing dtente. Instead, there is frustration. And a growing sense, as Sandberg noted, that the debate isnt being waged on the level. Felix Biederman,   of the Chapo Trap House podcast, argued that the count of political third rails in Trumps America and across the West had diminished    and that the failure to recognize as much was rooted more in an instinct for   than any discernible strategy. With the Democrats in worse shape than ever and Labour winning the most it had since 1997 amidst party mutiny and a full media assault on its leader, who is the practical one here? he said. Politics is a horrible, compromising business, but I would advise American liberals not to forfeit the hardest fights while pointing to their quite substandard record."
Unpopular Gas Tax Could Hurt California Democrats in 2018 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/10/2017,"Californians reject the new gas tax and vehicle registration fee increases passed by Gov. Jerry Brown and the   California legislature. [Moreover, according to the director of a new study from UC Berkleys Institute of Governmental Studies, the backlash against the gas tax could cost Democrats seats in the legislature come election time.  SB 1 passed through both houses of the California legislature in April. The new UC Berkley study found that even in deep blue California, 58 percent of voters oppose the bill, and39 percent strongly oppose it, according to the Sacramento Bee. The only region of the state not to oppose the bill was the   Bay Area. Only strongly liberal voters supported the law. All racial and ethnic   surveyed opposed it, as did every respondent 30 or older. The   group was evenly divided between favor and opposition. Only 35 percent of voters were for the tax increase. Poll director Mark DiCamillo predicted that hitting peoples pocketbooks could alarm them and result in political backlash in competitive legislative districts, according to the report. The law starts going into effect on November 1, when drivers will see a     tax increase included in their gas prices, and 50% of a     increase in the diesel excise tax. The new law also allows for an inflation adjustment on both gas and diesel. Next January 1, those registering their cars in the state can expect registration fee increases between $25 and $175 dollars. The fee increase is based on vehicle value and will also adjust for inflation.   vehicle owners will not escape the hit from the new law, either. Starting July 1, 2020,   vehicle models 2020 and later will see a new $100 annual vehicle registration fee. That fee is is also adjustable for inflation. The California Senate Appropriations Committee estimated in its bill analysis that the law would raise $52. 4 billion in transportation revenues over 10 years. The money would be divided up almost equally between local and state purposes. The only Senate Democrat to vote against the bill was Steve Glazer of Orinda. Following his vote, he said he opposed the tax because his constituents were    against the bill, according to the San Jose Mercury News. The Bee pointed to Fullerton Democrat Sen. Josh Newmans district as a potential early indicator of how the tax and fee increase could affect legislative races in 2018. Newmans opponents have launched a recall effort and are using his support for the fee increases as an argument against him. He won his current seat by fewer than 2, 500 votes in 2016. Republican Assemblyman Travis Allen (  Beach) has spearheaded his own effort to put a gas tax repeal on the 2018 ballot. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana"
Cal Attorney General Threatens Trump Administration over Haste or Greed - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/10/2017,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra wrote a letter to U. S. Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke threatening legal action if the Trump Administration for haste or greed tries to revoke or weaken 6 designated national monuments in California. [President Trump issued an April 26 Executive Order instructing the Department of the Interior to review 20 to 40 Presidential designations or expansions of designations under the 1906 Antiquities Act made since January 1, 1996.  The President directed the review over the next 45 days to focus on designations that now cover 100, 000 or more acres or any designation or expansion where Secretary Zinke determined there was a lack of adequate public outreach and coordination with relevant stakeholders. Secretary Zinke is to report his findings on June 14, which will then start the   regulatory clock that would lead to amending or rescinding designations. Attorney General Becerra warned Zinke in a letter, National monument designations protect the irreplaceable natural and cultural heritage that belongs to all Americans, ensuring that the haste or greed of one generation does not squander those gifts at the expense of future generations.  Becerra warned that any such move would be unlawful and he would take any and all action necessary to protect the American heritage which has become part of our monument lands, according to the Highland Community News. During the Obama Administration, the President used the Antiquities Act 34 times to set aside a record 553 million acres of national lands and waters, according to the New York Times. As a result, the four states with the largest federal ownership   Alaska at 95. 8 percent, Nevada at 87. 8 percent, Utah at 75. 2 percent and Idaho at 70. 4 percent. Breitbart News reported that U. S. Senator Dianne Feinstein asked Obama to use the Antiquities Act, after failing to get Congressional approvals for Mojave Trails, Sand to Snow, and Castle Mountains national parks. Although the Act specifically directs the President to limit the designation to the smallest area compatible with proper care and management of the objects to be protected, the three desert parcels were over 1 million acres. Feinstein claimed she was protecting mountain lions, desert tortoise, and bighorn sheep, but angry desert residents complained that the real reason was to ban   hunters, miners and oil drillers. According to the Atlantic, former Congressman Becerra was chosen by Governor Jerry Brown to replace the previous Attorney General Kamala Harris, who was elected Californias junior senator in November to support 15 other Democrat Attorney Generals in a united front of forward leaning politics against Trumps agenda. The Atlantic believes that Attorney General Becerra can play the role against Trump that Texas Attorney General, now Governor, Greg Abbott, and current Attorney General Ken Paxton, played against Obama. Abbott sued the federal government 50 times on issues ranging from Obamacare to the transgender bathroom mandate. Abbott said his job for 8 years was to go work, sue the federal government, and then go back home. Abbott filed 50 lawsuits, won 7, lost 12, dropped 9, and 20 are still working their way through the courts. Becerra at age 59 is believed to be angling to run in 2018 for Senate if the   old Feinstein decides to retire or even run for governor."
Calif. AG Attacks Accomplice Paul Ryan for Defense of Donald Trump in Handling James Comey,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/10/2017,"California Attorney General Xavier Becerra lashed out at House Speaker Paul Ryan in a new interview in which Becerra discussed Ryans defense of President Donald Trumps interactions with former FBI Director James Comey. [Becerra labeled Ryan Trumps accomplice in the AGs interview with the Associated Press. He was referencing comments Ryan made in a Thursday news conference that occurred while former FBI Director James Comey was testifying before Congress on Capitol Hill.  By the end of Comeys testimony he had admitted leaking information from privileged conversations with Trump to the media through a friend and that, while still serving as FBI Director, he told the President multiple times that Trump was not under FBI investigation for alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 election. In written comments for the hearing, Comey claimed that in a February 14 interaction with Trump, the President said to him, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.  Ryan was asked in the Thursday press conference about the interaction between the two men. The Speaker said of Trump, The Presidents new at this. Hes new to government. So, he probably wasnt steeped in the   protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses.  Pressed by a CNN reporter, Ryan added of Trump, he is learning as he goes.  Trump has denied ever having asked Comey to drop the investigation into   National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. In the AP interview, California AG Becerra attacked Ryans tepid defense of Trump, How dare you say its a novice mistake? Back in December, as Becerra awaited confirmation of his position as Californias next Attorney General, NBC News cited USC professor and director of the Toms Rivera Policy Institute Robert Suro, who said that Becerra could become the new face of the Trump resistance.  Suro added,       that is a very popular idea in a lot of places, that California Democrats are going to be the vanguard of opposition to the Trump administration.  UCLA Blue Print reporter Jim Newton called Becerra the point of the spear that is California when it comes to resisting Trump on immigration enforcement and climate change. Becerra claimed to the AP that he has tried to engage with the Trump administration on their plans for immigration enforcement, but has been unsuccessful. Im not trying to thwart ICE from doing its work, theyre doing some really important stuff and were doing some really important stuff with them, Becerra claimed. He told the outlet that he was open to working with the administration on issues of sex trafficking and illegal drugs. California Democrats have been pushing hard and fast to pass a bill that would officially make California a sanctuary state.  State officials have been among the most outspoken against the Trump Administration. Becerra left his seat in Congress last January to take up the position of California Attorney General that   Kamala Harris vacated. Democrat Harris won election to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer. Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana"

"Gays Against Sharia March Branded Islamophobic, Will Be Picketed by LGBT Activists",Breitbart,Donna Rachel Edmunds,6/10/2017,"An event organised by Gays Against Sharia to mark the anniversary of the Orlando shooting has been branded divisive and Islamophobic by LGBT activists planning a  . [The organisers of the Unite Against Hate march, set to take place in Manchester on Sunday, say they organised the event to honour the victims of hate including the 49 people who lost their lives at Pulse, a gay club in Orlando, Florida, at the hands of an Islamic terrorist on June 12, 2016.  Planned speakers include author Shazia Hobbs, a Glaswegian who was forced into an arranged marriage at 18 with a man who beat her, believing it was his right under Sharia law Mohammed Fiaz, a Christian convert from Islam and founder and former leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson. But LGBT activists have reacted with fury, insisting the event is nothing more than the cynical hijacking of gay rights by the far right as a cover for Islamophobia. Two groups, Lesbians and Gays Support the Migrants, and Action for Trans Health, are arranging a   against the march. Were protesting because the   want to use Orlando and the recent killings in the UK to demonise all Muslims, one of the organisers of the   Anna, told Pink News. We are clear that it is genocidal to consider millions of people responsible for the actions of a few violent men. As queers, we know what its like for   to hate us     so we wont be divided like this.  One of the organisers of the Unite Against Hate march is Tommy English, a fellow traveller of Tommy Robinsons and former leader of the English Defence Leagues LGBT group who now runs Gays Against Sharia. Opponents have seized upon his presence to claim the march is nothing but a front for   Islamophobes. Pink News quotes Sam Bjorn as saying: As LGBT+ people we wont stand idly by as far right bigots like the EDL attempt to use our rights as a weapon against people from the Muslim community. When groups like the EDL are preying on tragedy like the recent attack in Manchester to promote hate and division, its more important than ever to come together and say that we do not tolerate their Islamophobia and racism. We encourage everyone, gay or straight, to join us on 11 June to show that the LGBT+ community and the people of Manchester wont let the hate of   bigots divide us.  Pink News has joined in the condemnation, branding the event as a fake and accusing the organisers of hijacking the first anniversary of the Pulse nightclub shooting with an   march, which it described as a disturbing tactic.

BREAKING: Border Patrol Agent Found Seriously Injured on Side of Roadway after Attack,Breitbart,Brandon Darby,6/10/2017,"An   U. S. Border Patrol agent was discovered on the side of a roadway with serious injuries to his head, chest, and hands, according to officials. The Border Patrol agent appears to have been ruthlessly attacked. Sources first alerted Breitbart Texas to the incident and Customs and Border Protection (CBP) confirmed many of the details on the matter. The Border Patrol agent is assigned to the Deming, New Mexico, Border Patrol Station which is in the El Paso Sector. [According to CBP:  U. S. Customs and Border Protection is assisting in the investigation of a report of an assault against an   Border Patrol agent assigned to the Deming, New Mexico, Border Patrol Station. The agent was discovered on the side of the road by a motorist at 11 p. m. MDT. The agent suffered multiple, serious injuries to his head, chest and hands. Emergency Medical Services transported the agent to a nearby hospital where he is being treated for his wounds. The agent is in stable condition. CBP is working closely with the FBI, Dona Ana County Sheriffs Office, and the El Paso Police Department on the ongoing investigation. CBP has informed its workforce of this report and has reminded its law enforcement personnel to be alert and aware of their surroundings and potential threats related to their service.  The region immediately south of the border in the area is controlled by the Juarez Cartel and their enforcers, La Linea. They operate in the El Paso Sector and are known to abduct individuals and administer torture techniques. The fact that the FBI is investigating the matter, rather than just local law enforcement agencies, would indicate that the attack on the Border Patrol agent is due to his employment as a law enforcement officer with the U. S. government. Also, the warning issued by CBP to Border Patrol agents indicates that the violent attack was related to the agents employment as a law enforcement officer with the U. S. government. The warning shows that CBP feels this attack indicates possible risks to additional agents along the U. S.  border. CBP did not alert the public or other Border Patrol agents until after the agency was contacted by Breitbart Texas. Only after CBP was contacted, did they hurry and publish a statement. A spokesman for CBP contradicts this assertion and claims that they internally notified agents, not the public, prior to being contacted by Breitbart Texas.

Texas Sheriff Actively Promoting Visas for Illegal Immigrants,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/10/2017,"A Texas sheriff is actively promoting visas to the illegal immigrant community. The sheriff is preparing pamphlets advising certain illegal immigrants how they might qualify for special visas. [Travis County Sheriff Sanctuary Sally Hernandez came up with the idea of instructing crime victims who happen to be in the country illegally on how they can apply for a U visa, Fox 7 in Austin reported. Merely filing out the application for the visa, intended to help true crime victims, is enough to at least temporarily block immigration officials from deporting an applicant.  Her work continues to propagate the myth that Texas new sanctuary city law (previously known as Senate Bill 4) is a threat to crime victims. During the final days of the debate, several Texas law enforcement officials joined together penning an   published in April by the Dallas Morning News. The police chiefs stated: Officers would start inquiring about the immigration status of every person they come in contact with, or worse, inquire about the immigration status of people based on their appearance. This will lead to distrust of police and less cooperation from members of the community. And it will foster the belief that people cannot seek assistance from police for fear of being subjected to an immigration status investigation. Distrust and fear of contacting or assisting the police have already become evident among legal immigrants. Legal immigrants are beginning to avoid contact with the police for fear that they themselves or undocumented family members or friends may become subject to immigration enforcement. Such a divide between the local police and immigrant groups will result in increased crime against immigrants and in the broader community, create a class of silent victims, and eliminate the potential for assistance from immigrants in solving crimes or preventing crime. Their statement ignores the fact that SB 4 specifically prohibits officers from inquiring about the immigration status of a crime victim or a witness to a crime, unless the information is pertinent to the crime as in the case of human smuggling or sex trafficking crimes. ARITCLE 6, SECTION 6. 01 Article 2. 13: (I) n the course of investigating an alleged criminal offense, a peace officer may inquire ast o the nationality or immigration status of a victim of or witness to the offense only if the officer determines that the inquiry is necessary to: (1) Investigate the offense or (2) provide the victim or witness with information about federal visas designed to protect individuals providing assistance to law enforcement. In apparently ignoring this section of the new law (effective September 1, 2017) the Travis County Sheriffs Office is preparing to   distribute flyers. These flyers could be used to teach people how to abuse or take advantage of a program designed to protect true victims of or witnesses to crimes. I think that just with the political climate in general across the U. S. that we have victims not reporting crime and thats a concern for us. I mean, we care about all of the victims regardless of immigration status. We want to make sure that we have an avenue to ensure them theyre safe to come and speak with us, Captain Craig Smith of the Travis County Sheriffs Office told Fox 7 News. Sheriff Hernandez is having the pamphlets printed up to begin distribution, Travis County Sheriffs Office Spokesman Kristin Dark told Breitbart Texas in an email response. It is currently being published in English and Spanish, despite the fact that Travis County has immigrant communities speaking many different languages. The report by Fox 7 does not state what funds the sheriff is using to pay for these pamphlets. Dark told Breitbart Texas she would research the source of funding. The sheriffs office told the local Fox affiliate they currently receive about 10 U visa applications per month. They stated the department attempts to process the visas within 30 days to forward to immigration officials. The federal government issues approximately 10, 000 U visas per year. Victims or witnesses granted approval receive up to four years of protected status. They are required to cooperate with law enforcement regarding prosecuting the crime they witnessed or were a victim of. While the application is pending, the applicant cannot be removed from the U. S. Fox 7 reported. At least one Democrat Texas sheriff stood up to tell the truth about SB 4. Hidalgo County Sheriff J. E. Eddie Guerra joined with local chiefs of police in the Rio Grande Valley to try and calm the flames of fear being fanned by others across the state. As Texas Governor Greg Abbott has stated [SB 4] is simply a mechanism such that when someone has a criminal record, or who is also wanted by [U. S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement] they are going to be detained and turned over to ICE, Sheriff Guerra told local reporters. If you have not committed a crime, regardless of your immigration status, and unless you are subject to an ICE detainer, you have absolutely nothing to worry about.  Sheriff Guerra told the McAllen newspaper, The Monitor, To all the people we serve, we want you to know we are here to help you. We want you to continue working with us. Now more than ever we all need to work together     we need to encourage you to report crimes, suspicious activity and fugitives, so that we may all enjoy a better quality of life and a safer community.  In contrast to Sheriff Guerras honesty about the new law, Breitbart Texas reported that Travis County Sheriff Sanctuary Sally Hernandez teamed up with four other Texas sheriffs to claim that FBI crime statistics have found that labeled sanctuary cities experience lower rates of all crime types, including homicides.  Although fact checkers at the    PolitiFact admitted that the FBI report does not exist, they still dubbed the statements  .  In my book, a half true for an open borders study from Politifact means it was definitely bogus, Center for Immigration Studies Director of Policy Studies Jessica Vaughn told Breitbart Texas. It means we would like it to be true, but it wasnt.  Bob Price serves as associate editor and senior political news contributor for Breitbart Texas.

Tennessee Prison Hosts Program to Help Inmates Become Better Fathers,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/10/2017,"A Tennessee prison program designed to help inmates become better fathers graduated nearly 40 inmates Friday. [The selected inmates graduated from the Malachi Dads program at the Morgan County Correctional Complex, which teaches inmates   skills and fosters personal growth so inmates can become better fathers, WBIR reported.  I picked the streets before my family, and this program has shown me that God is first, then my family second, inmate Darryl Wiseman said. For the past year, Wiseman has been taking classes facilitated by volunteer mentors of the program. The program culminates Saturday with the Returning Hearts Celebration, where the fathers reunite with their families in the prison yard and participate in   activities with them. I think Im going to cry real hard first, Wiseman said ahead of Saturdays celebration. Im going to be nervous to see them because I want them to see a new side of me. Theyre going to be able to see that I have that glow, that I have that light and that Im walking for him now, for Jesus. Theyre going to see the gentler side of me.  Wiseman, who has served three years out of a   sentence, says he found purpose in life as a result of these classes. It changed my life, it really did. If changed me on how to be a man and a father to my children, he said. Robert Reburn, a public information officer for the Tennessee Department of Corrections, said there is no statistical data to measure the impact of the program but stated that corrections officers have noticed inmates behavior change because of programs like Malachi Dads. We can say for a fact that offenders who are still in our custody and enrolled in these programs are less argumentative, they get less discipline, they cause fewer problems and they are overall much more well behaved than those who are not participating, Reburn said. Other states have similar programs implemented in their prisons, mostly organized by   ministries. These programs have been   in Michigan, Colorado, and Wisconsin."
Sex Attacks At Swedish Festivals Have Risen 1000 Percent,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/10/2017,"A new report has revealed that sex attacks at Swedish festivals have increased as much as 1000 percent in 2016, a trend which does not appear to be changing.[  organisation The Night Shift say they have documented over a hundred cases of sexual molestation, and that the numbers continue to rise Expressen reports. Over the past year, Sweden has seen a dramatic increase in the number of sex attacks at open air festivals and amusement parks across the country.  Grona Lund, an amusement park in Stockholm, was the scene of one sex attack last year, but so far this year there have been at least four according to security manager Fredrik Gemzell. The park, which has only been open since April, is one of the busiest in the country. All cases are reported to the police. It is young teenage girls who have been victims, said Gemzell adding, We have our own security centre, where visitors can call. In addition, we have a security team which patrols the park. It is good that the police reported. Its an incredible, totally unacceptable behaviour.  In reaction to the many sex attacks over the last year, Lisen Andrasson Florman formed the Night Shift, an NGO designed to help put pressure on festival organisers to prevent future sex attacks. Despite some festival organisers listening to the complaints and increasing their security, festivals like We are Sthlm still saw 50 sexual assault incidents.    Alexandra Larsson was a victim of a sex attack at the Putte i Parken in Karlstad last year. First, someone touched me on the butt a few times. I turned around and inquired who had done it, but got no answer, Larrson said. This was repeated several times. Finally, someone took me on the genitals. Then I got angry and turned around and shouted, Whoever it was, you are an idiot!  Larrson was one of 32 young girls who was sexually attacked at the festival according to reports. The youngest was only   . Many of the men who have committed sex attacks at the various festivals were described as having a foreign origin.  At the Bravalla Festival in Norrkoping another girl, only 15, claimed that foreign men had sexually attacked her and her five friends. Official data from the Swedish government has shown that over the last two years sexual assaults have risen by a massive 70 percent nationwide. Between 13 and 14 percent of women now say they wont venture out alone at night due to fears they may become victims of an attack."
"EXCLUSIVE: Border Patrol Agent was Kidnapped, FBI Leads Investigation",Breitbart,Brandon Darby,6/10/2017,"A leaked official document from the El Paso Sector Intelligence and Operations Center reveals that the injured   Border Patrol agent who was discovered on the side of a roadway on June 9, 2017, is believed to have been kidnapped prior to sustaining severe injuries to his head, chest, and hands.  Breitbart Texas exclusively obtained the document from a trusted source operating under the umbrella of Customs and Border Protection (CBP). [Due to sensitive information present in the document, Breitbart Texas will not identify the type of document nor most of the information contained within the document at this time. The document does specifically identify that a Border Patrol agent was kidnapped and assaulted. The document also asserts that the FBI in El Paso, Texas, is leading the investigation. The document also warns law enforcement agents. It asserts, Agents are advised to remain vigilant and maintain a heightened level of awareness.   A statement received on the matter from CBP stated: U. S. Customs and Border Protection is assisting in the investigation of a report of an assault against an   Border Patrol agent assigned to the Deming, New Mexico, Border Patrol Station. The agent was discovered on the side of the road by a motorist at 11 p. m. MDT. The agent suffered multiple, serious injuries to his head, chest and hands. Emergency Medical Services transported the agent to a nearby hospital where he is being treated for his wounds. The agent is in stable condition. CBP is working closely with the FBI, Dona Ana County Sheriffs Office, and the El Paso Police Department on the ongoing investigation. CBP has informed its workforce of this report and has reminded its law enforcement personnel to be alert and aware of their surroundings and potential threats related to their service.

Saturday at The Peoples Summit in Chicago, former Obama green jobs czar and CNN contributor Van Jones ripped Hillary Clintons 2016 presidential campaign.  Jones took aim at the amount of money spent in the losing effort and how that money was spent. First of all, I dont mean to be rude     and I dont mean to offend anybody, Jones said. But the people who ran the Hillary Clinton campaign did not spend their money on white workers, and they did not spend it on people of color. They spent it on themselves. They spent it on themselves, lets be honest. They took a billion dollars, a billion dollars, a billion dollars, and set it on fire, and called it a campaign! That wasnt a campaign. Thats not a campaign.  A billion dollars for consultants, he added. A billion dollars for pollsters. A billion dollars for a data operation, that was run by data dummies who couldnt figure out that maybe people in Michigan needed to be organized.  Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"

"My family tree, split by Trump",CNN,Bill Weir,6/10/2017,"(CNN) You are at the top of your family tree. States of Change airs Saturday at 10 p. m. ET on CNN. Editors note: This is an excerpt from Bill Weirs journey retracing his past in a bid to understand Americas new cold civil war and explore why neighbors seem to have become strangers. Travel the rest of the way with Bill at States of Change. Maybe you have siblings and maybe you have saplings (or grand saplings) but at this moment you are perched on the highest branches of a bloodline Redwood. A lineage that somehow survived storms and disease, war and pestilence, love and hate, generation after generation. You are proud of your tree. You would fight for your tree. But how much do you really know about your tree? And how far down are you willing to climb? Ive been thinking about trees and bloodlines since Donald Trump won Wisconsin and America cracked in two. Half of my Facebook feed cheered his victory and thanked God for this miraculous answer to prayer. The other half churned through the stages of grief and braced for end of the world. It was like watching the American family tree get struck by lightning, trunk alive, branches on fire. If we are now locked in the Cold Civil War of 2017, most are firmly on either side of our    Divide, Make American Great Again caps vs. pussycat hats. But I have the vantage of an American mutt, raised in constant motion. Im a local in small towns and big cities, a native to states red and blue, at home in the branches of so many different trees thanks to a family that broke before I could walk. My father was a liberal, atheist homicide detective who fled Milwaukees   chaos for the serenity of the Rockies. My mother left him when I was 2, found Jesus when I was 4 and one Saturday announced over breakfast I had a dream from God last night. We were under Divine orders to leave Milwaukee and move to the Bible Belt, she explained, so she could pursue a career in televangelism. Tell your Dad Ill give up alimony and child support if he lets us go. Jesus will take care of us. A few weeks later we were headed south, modest   in tow. But God kept changing his mind. I went to 17 schools in six states as Mom followed her dreams. Literally. She never made it as the next Billy Graham but I found myself drawn to television, starting out in tiny meatpacking towns to big cities to networks in both Sodom (Los Angeles) and Gomorrah (New York). Life as The New Kid turned out to be great training for this gig and this moment when neighbors are strangers, fear and loathing rules the day and the American experiment seems doomed. If we are to survive the most divisive presidency in generations, its up to us to climb down our family trees and better understand how we got here. Its up to us to ask fellow countrymen Where are you from? with a lot less fear and a lot more wonder. Set out with Bill on his travels at States of Change."
LGBT community prepares for a march -- and a fight,CNN,Eugene Scott,6/10/2017,"(CNN) Two years after the White House was adorned in rainbow colors to commemorate the Supreme Courts ruling legalizing   marriage nationwide, gay rights activists and lawmakers are preparing to march on Washington again, saying the current President threatens to erase those gains. Gay rights activists plan to air their concerns at the Equality March for Unity and Pride in Washington on Sunday as well as at 50 sister marches at cities across the country this month. The march Sunday, which will commemorate the upcoming anniversary of the shooting deaths of 49 people and wounding of more than 50 others at gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, comes despite Trumps promises during the campaign to be a friend to the gay community. Although Trump has continued President Barack Obamas executive order protecting LGBT federal workers and LGBT military service members still serve openly, his administration has revoked protections for transgender school students, and its mentions of the words lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender in statements have been few and far between. Meanwhile, some of Trumps most controversial proposals such as building a border wall, implementing a travel ban from six majority Muslim countries, and repealing the Affordable Care Act, would negatively affect gay people, activists say. As a result, the Trump administration has instilled fear in gay people hoping to immigrate to the United States to escape countries that dont protect gay rights, transgender students at public schools who no longer have the protections outlined by the Obama administration, and   LGBT Americans depending on the Affordable Care Act for medication who fear the loss of health care under the GOPs repeal and replacement legislation, said Chad Griffin, president of the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights group. We are women. We are Muslims. We are asylum seekers, Griffin told CNN. We are all a part of the community this President has attacked day in and day out. Our community has stood up in coalition and said: If you come after one of us, youre coming after all of us. The group is launching a summer of action campaign, which it will kick off in tandem with the annual Capital Pride parade in Washington on Saturday and will feature more than 250 grassroots events nationwide aimed at educating LGBT people and their allies on the ways that they can advocate for policies that advance gay rights.  Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island, who   the Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus, said most Americans would be surprised to learn that you can get married on Saturday, post photos of your wedding on Sunday, and then get thrown out of your apartment or fired from your job on Monday. But that is the reality for LGBT people in most states today. And its dead wrong. Cicilline, who is working to get Congress to pass that would prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation, said in a statement to CNN that the Trump administration is starting to roll back gains the LGBT community has made in recent years.  Since taking office, President Trump has rescinded guidance to public schools regarding transgender students, Cicilline said. He has appointed an   Supreme Court Justice and several   officials in his administration. And he has done nothing to respond to the violence targeting gay men in Chechnya. The White House did not respond to CNNs request for comment, but Trump repeatedly cast himself as a champion for the LGBT community during the campaign, and he won significant praise for being the first Republican nominee to mention gay people in his acceptance speech. Although Clinton carried the endorsements of major LGBT groups, Trump questioned her commitment to the community.  Ask yourself, who is really the friend of women and the LGBT community? Donald Trump with actions or Hillary Clinton with her words? he said at a New Hampshire campaign event shortly after the June 2016 attack at the gay nightclub in Orlando. I will tell you who the better friend is. And some day I believe that will be proven out big league.  But while Trumps White House has been silent on the march and    unlike every year since 2009    has not announced it will host a reception recognizing June as LGBT Pride Month, the departments of Defense and State are observing the month this year and Ivanka Trump, a White House adviser to her father, took to Twitter to wish everyone a joyful #Pride2017. Conservative gay Americans, for their part, view the march as a partisan event emphasizing division far more than equality, said Gregory T. Angelo, president of Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative LGBT group. For months now weve heard that Trump is going to roll back advances made by the LGBT community, and time and again those rumors were proven to be unfounded, he told CNN. All of this   has turned the   Resistance into little more than a hollow cliche. Gay rights activists, however, say Trumps refusal to issue an official White House statement commemorating LGBT Pride Month    chosen by advocates to commemorate New Yorks Stonewall uprising in 1969    is symptomatic of the White Houses agenda for LGBT Americans. The march on Sunday will be an attempt to the let the Trump administration know that Americas LGBT community will not be ignored, they say.   The reason were all marching on the 11th is because its our job to stay visible and to stay louder than ever, Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD, a nonprofit that monitors the medias portrayal of LGBT people. Our visibility has been our greatest strength. Pride over the past few years has become more celebratory than ever, Ellis added. But I think were back to the times where its important for us to be loud and resistant and fight for our rights and visibility. I want them to take the message that were not going away, that we will not be erased and that we need to be acknowledged and brought into the conversations and into legislation. Lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and fellow California Democrats Adam Schiff, Ted Lieu, and Maxine Waters, are scheduled to address activists Sunday at the various marches and challenge them on how they can better respond in the current political climate. Outside the Beltway, meanwhile, legal teams and organizations that once fought for   marriage in courthouses across the country have been training their sites on a new purpose       religious freedom bills at the state level that would allow individuals and businesses to deny services they feel are contrary to their religious beliefs. While defenders of the bills say they protect First Amendment rights, LGBT groups say they merely legalize discrimination.  Vice President Mike Pence signed the countrys first state religious freedom bill into law in Indiana during his governorship in 2015. Evan Wolfson, who founded Freedom to Marry, an organization often credited for   marriage victories on state and federal levels, said the legislation stems from the same   industry as in the past, adding that the political and legal landscapes have changed since the Supreme Court guaranteed   marriage equality in 2015. Theres no question theres a lot of things to be afraid of, he said.  [But] the battle lines are not where they were before and we have more to work with in those battles.   LGBT civil rights groups are also fighting   bathroom bills, like North Carolinas now repealed law that targeted transgender peoples use of public restrooms.   This is an attempt by an extreme group of politicians to target a community for political purposes    efforts to legislate transgender people out of life, said Sarah McBride, national press secretary for the Human Rights Campaign, which notes transgender people face high rates of job discrimination, homelessness and physical violence and are more likely than even   sexual minorities to experience violence from the police."
"Afghan soldier kills 3 US soldiers, US official says",CNN,Ryan Browne,6/10/2017,"(CNN) Three US soldiers were killed and another wounded during a joint   military operation Saturday in Nangarhar province, US officials told CNN. The Pentagon named the three soldiers Monday as Sgt. Eric M. Houck, 25, of Baltimore Sgt. William M. Bays, 29, of Barstow, California and Cpl. Dillon C. Baldridge, 22, of Youngsville, North Carolina.  On Monday evening Vice President Pence was at Dover Air Force Base to attend the dignified transfer of the three soldiers. Pence stood with his hand over his heart as the flag draped caskets were brought off the plane. An American official said the soldiers were shot in an apparent insider attack, also known as a    incident because of the   system used by NATO. During such assaults, members of the Afghan security forces are known to target US and other NATO soldiers.  The shooter in Saturdays incident was an Afghan army commando, Nangarhar provincial spokesman Attaullah Khogyani said. He said the assailant was killed by Afghan forces.  The shootings occurred in the Achin District, where US and Afghan troops have been carrying out a monthslong offensive against a local affiliate of ISIS, officials said. Taliban claim responsibility, Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid said the militants claimed responsibility for the attack. A Mujahid (freedom fighter) infiltrator of the Islamic Emirate who had enrolled himself in the Kabul governments army attacked American soldiers in Lata Band area of Achin District in Nangarhar province today in the afternoon, said a written statement in Pashto obtained by CNN. The American invaders were there to support their Afghan slaves. US President Donald Trump was briefed on the shootings, and Vice President Mike Pence said Saturday that details of the attack would be forthcoming. When heroes fall, Americans grieve, Pence said Saturday. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of these American heroes. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer acknowledged the deaths in his Monday briefing. The incident is currently under investigation, but our thoughts and our prayers are with the families of these American heroes who lost their lives in this tragic event, Spicer said. A US military spokesman in Afghanistan said the military will release more information when appropriate. Soldiers families mourn, Houck had two children, 5 and 3, and was due to come home next month, his father, Mike, told CNN affiliate WBAL. He is a hero, Mike Houck told the station. You realize that important person you love is never coming back into your life, he added. Hell always be in my heart. Hell always be in my thoughts. Baldridge was also supposed to return home this summer. Family members told CNN affiliate WRAL he went to Afghanistan in October and was due back in August. Russell Holloman, the principal of Franklinton High School, said Baldridge, who graduated in 2012, was a kindhearted and giving person. He made an early commitment to the military during his high school career and maintained that focus and selfless dedication after graduation, Holloman said in a statement. Our community has truly lost a hero. Afghan police killed in another incident, In Kabul, meanwhile, the US military command said an unspecified number of Afghan police were killed and wounded in a friendly fire incident during a joint   operation overnight Saturday. US Forces Afghanistan said members of the Afghan Border Police in Helmand province were killed and wounded during an operation involving US and Afghan defense and security forces.  The deaths occurred when a US aircraft fired on Afghan police, said Omar Zawak, spokesman for the governor of Helmand.  US Forces Afghanistan was investigating the incident. Two US service members killed in April, US and coalition casualties in Afghanistan have become rarer in recent years, falling dramatically since the Afghan government assumed responsibility for combat operations in 2014. But in late April, two US service members were killed and another wounded while conducting a joint raid in the Achin District, a Pentagon spokesman said. The operation was targeting   the terrorist groups Afghanistan affiliate. Achin District is the primary base of operations for ISIS in Afghanistan and has been the site of multiple joint   counterterrorism missions. A US Army Special Forces soldier was killed fighting the terrorist group there in early April.  The district is also where the United States dropped one of its most powerful bombs, killing close to 100 ISIS fighters, according to Afghan officials. Beginning in 2016, Afghan security forces backed by US military advisers launched a major offensive against ISIS. Gen. John W. Nicholson, commander of US Forces Afghanistan, has said the terrorist group has lost about half its fighters and been ejected from   of its territory. The latest   push began in March of this year. US officials estimate ISIS has 600 to 800 fighters in the country, mostly former members of other regional terrorist groups, such as the Pakistani Taliban and Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. ISIS is believed to be behind a series of terrorist attacks, including the recent fatal attack on a hospital in Kabul. There are about 8, 400 US troops in Afghanistan. The US counterterrorism mission is separate from the   effort to train, advise and assist the Afghan army and police force in the fight against the Taliban."
Trump adds Poland stop during G20 trip,CNN,Elizabeth Landers,6/10/2017,"(CNN) The White House announced that President Donald Trump will visit Poland during a trip to Europe next month for the G20 summit. The President accepted an invitation from Polish President Andrzej Duda to visit before the international summit begins on July 7. Poland, a more   government, provides a natural stop for Republican politicians. The visit will reaffirm Americas steadfast commitment to one of our closest European allies and emphasize the Administrations priority of strengthening NATOs collective defense, read a statement from press secretary Sean Spicers office. There will be a major speech during the trip, a standard practice for presidents when they travel abroad. The G20, a larger showing of international leaders than the   summit, which is only seven nations, will include Russian President Vladimir Putin, a point of great interest as rumors and investigations of reported Russian meddling into the 2016 elections consume congressional hearings.  When asked by reporters on Friday whether the President would be meeting with Putin in Germany during the summit, a senior White House official said, well keep you posted. The official did not rule out a meeting, saying that the individual meetings with international leaders would be decided closer to the date. It will be the second foreign trip for Trump. His first trip oversees last month included an ambitious   swing in the span of a week. The President touched a glowing orb, held bilateral meetings and established relationships with foreign leaders, even giving his cell phone number to   French President Emmanuel Macron."
"For Trump, a prosecution of Comey would be a disaster",CNN,Paul Callan,6/10/2017,"(CNN) The President and his personal attorney, Marc Kasowitz, should be careful what they wish for.  In his aggressive defense of President Trump, Kasowitz has in substance accused the former Director of the FBI of leaking privileged communications and of possibly committing perjury in his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.   The Kasowitz accusations, made shortly after James Comey completed the public portion of his Senate testimony, if actively pursued, would necessarily shroud the Trump administration in a complex web of investigations, congressional hearings and court proceedings that would ultimately pull it into a black hole of legal destruction.  If Kasowitz s accusations of criminal conduct against Comey were accepted and believed by the Senate and federal prosecutors and a federal grand jury indictment followed, the result would be a criminal trial of the former FBI director, requiring the testimony under oath of the President of the United States. Trump said Friday that hed be willing to testify under oath one hundred percent. Such a grand jury investigation and presentation would necessarily require the appointment of a second special counsel or the creation of a new independent prosecutor to avoid any interaction and conflict with the Justice Department, which nominally directs and controls the current Robert   investigation under existing law. Muellers current appointment authority doesnt cover investigation of the FBI or its former director.   In his written statement Kasowitz  alleges that, The President also never told Mr. Comey, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty in form or substance. The President followed with a Tweet of his own at 6:10am Friday   asserting that, Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication . ..and WOW, Comey is a leaker! Kasowitz also claimed that Comeys testimony about being pressured by President Trump to drop the Flynn investigation is patently false.  The Presidents personal counsel asserts . .. the President never, in form or substance, directed or suggested that Mr. Comey stop investigating anyone, including suggesting that that Mr. Comey let Flynn go.  Comey, on the other hand, emphatically differs with the Kasowitz version, stating that the President demanded a loyalty pledge from him that was then followed by what must have been a very awkward silence with Comey eventually pledging, honest loyalty.      Of course Comey believes and has implied throughout his testimony that the whole reason Trump sought a loyalty pledge was to bludgeon the director into dropping a criminal investigation of Trumps disgraced National Security Adviser Gen. Michael Flynn and to take the pressure off the Russia investigation.   Comey also asserted that Presidents odd request that Attorney General Jeff Sessions and the Presidents chief of staff, Reince Priebus, leave the room before the President privately advised Comey that he hoped Comey would drop the Flynn investigation raised his hackles as an investigator. Kasowitz s other assertions that Comey leaked privileged information are patent nonsense, as Comey did not have an   relationship with the President, the leaked memos were not classified, and the President explicitly waived executive privilege. (Executive privilege would be inapplicable here in any event.)  If prosecutors pursue the crime of obstruction of justice, it would create a   exception to both executive and   privileges in the unlikely event that they were even relevant to the conversations in question. The Kasowitz charges against Comey are going nowhere, though the Trump strategy has always been to punch back hard when attacked. The strategy may work when your opponent is weak and underfunded but not here. Comey is unlikely to fold like a creditor of an old Trump Atlantic City casino.  Someone in the White House will undoubtedly be sensible enough to understand that a referral of potential criminal charges to an Inspector General, Congress and the Justice Department could spiral into a new special prosecutor appointment, new Congressional hearings and as well as a Grand Jury inquiry and trial with the President himself as the central witness in the entire case.  Such proceedings would paralyze an already crippled presidency and in all probability, would end in the complete exoneration of James Comey.   So Mr. President, dont go there."
Mueller staffing up Russia probe,CNN,Laura Jarrett,6/10/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trumps lawyer has responded to fired FBI Director James Comeys   to Congress by taking a victory lap. The evening before Comeys testimony, Marc Kasowitz was spotted buying a box of cigars, and sources overheard him saying, We won. Trumps in the clear. . .. Its clear Trump didnt do anything wrong. He continued his celebration the next day, declaring, The President feels completely vindicated. But former prosecutors say its far too early to pop the champagne. On the other side of Pennsylvania Avenue, special counsel Robert Mueller has been quietly and methodically building the equivalent of a small US attorneys office    a team of formidable legal minds whove worked on everything from Watergate to Enron, unlikely to leave any stone unturned. Legal dream team in white shirts and dark suits, Right out of the gate, Mueller brought on three partners from his former law firm, WilmerHale, with significant litigating experience in high stakes cases: Aaron Zebley, who previously served as Muellers chief of staff at the FBI Jeannie Rhee, a former federal prosecutor and top official at the Justice Departments Office of Legal Counsel and James Quarles, who worked on the Watergate investigation as a young prosecutor. Rhees past work on behalf of the Clinton Foundation is unlikely to go ignored by Trump supporters    though others at WilmerHale, such as Jamie Gorelick, currently represent Trumps immediate family members. Mueller has also reportedly recruited skillful prosecutors from within the highest levels at DOJ    including Andrew Weissmann, chief of the Criminal Divisions fraud section, who served as former director of the Enron Task Force and general counsel under Mueller at the FBI.  Jared Kushners New York Observer ran a series of scathing stories depicting Weissmann and then Assistant Attorney General Leslie R. Caldwell as   prosecutors that ran roughshod over defendants rights during the Enron investigation, but during his tenure with DOJ, hes won a series of honors, including the Attorney Generals Award for Exceptional Service in 2006. But perhaps the most significant hire to date was reported by the National Law Journal on Friday: deputy solicitor general Michael Dreeben, a prolific Supreme Court advocate who oversees the Justice Departments criminal appellate docket.  Preet Bharara    former US attorney of the Southern District of New York, who has had his own tussle with Trump and had a ringside seat to Comeys testimony Thursday    tweeted that Dreeben is one of the top legal and appellate minds at DOJ in modern times. It appears that Bob Mueller is recruiting the smartest and most seasoned professionals who have a long track record of independence and excellence, added Bharara.  And former acting US solicitor general Neal Katyal, who is a partner at Hogan Lovells and one of the lead attorneys for Hawaii in the travel ban lawsuit against Trump, agrees that the choice of Dreeben is telling. You dont bring Michael Dreeben onto something ordinary, said Katyal. Hes the top criminal law practitioner in the United States. Impeccable legal credentials arent the only requirement for this work, however. Mueller has set the tone at the top with a dress code    even if only for himself    showing he means business. A source tells CNN he is back to his old uniform from his days at the Justice Department and FBI: plain white shirts and dark suits.  Thats a departure from his more recent private sector law firm days, when on occasion he was seen wearing a blue shirt or, shockingly to those who worked with him for years, a shirt with a checked pattern on it. During the 12 years he led the FBI, agents knew never to wear anything but a suit, white shirt and a tie, or risk being sent away.  For the moment, the team is holed up in an office building four blocks from Justice Department headquarters. But a source tells CNN theres no secure room to review highly classified material, otherwise known as a SCIF, so the team will likely have to find new quarters at some point. A spokesperson for Mueller declined to comment.  A surgeons scalpel For the President, building a team of qualified lawyers to go    against Mueller has gotten off to a slower start. Kasowitz    an aggressive civil litigator and longtime Trump attorney, has been seeking advice from influential DC lawyers on ways to round out the Presidents defense team, according to one source, but so far has not recruited one of the more   lawyers with investigative experience to work with him. A source tells CNN that Jay Sekulow and Michael Bowe, another attorney at Kasowitzs firm, have joined the defense team. Bowe has represented Trump in past real estate disputes and attended Thursdays news conference after Comeys testimony, standing with Kasowitz. And Sekulow, chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice, has already published an   for Fox News arguing (w) ith his testimony, Comeys case against President Trump collapsed like a house of cards. Legal experts caution, however, that enlisting the right people with the right experience in this case is essential. The worst thing you can do here is use a butchers   instead of a surgeons scalpel, says former federal prosecutor Robert Bennett, who represented President Bill Clinton during the Paula Jones scandal and now practices at Hogan Lovells.  That advice is perhaps even more critical after Comeys testimony on Thursday suggesting that Muellers investigation may eventually escalate to whether the President obstructed justice by firing Comey.  If Kasowitzs victory speech hinges on Comeys admission this week that he previously said Trump wasnt personally under an FBI counterintelligence investigation that doesnt close the case. Bob Muellers investigation is just beginning, says Kevin Andrew Chambers, white collar partner at Latham  Watkins and former Assistant US Attorney in DC. It is far too early for anyone to speculate where he will end up and folks should get comfortable with the fact that it could be a couple years before he reports his findings. Remember, he is a career prosecutor. His focus will be on accumulating and reviewing the entire body of evidence rather than fixating on any one document, witness, or event."
#FBF: FDRs toga party at the White House,CNN,Brenna Williams,6/10/2017,"(CNN) Believe it or not, there is a tasteful way to hold a toga party. President Franklin D. Roosevelt proved that with his 1934   birthday bash. Ahead of President Donald Trumps birthday on June 14, were taking a #FlashbackFriday look at a very memorable presidential birthday from the past.  In the photo above from the the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museums collection, you can see Roosevelt    or in the spirit of the festivities, Caesar Roosevelt    seated before a   birthday cake, draped in a cape and crowned with a laurel. Roosevelt is surrounded by   revelers, including his wife, Eleanor, and some soldiers. Casual. In the background, you can see one of the iconic   windows of the White House residences sitting rooms.  The party was held on January 30, 1934, Roosevelts 52nd birthday. According to the FDR Library, the theme was chosen as a joke, poking fun at FDRs critics who called him a dictator. (Trolling is not a 21st century invention.) Attention to detail was clearly key for a Rooseveltian birthday. Look at the ferns covering the floor, the palms surrounding the group and the excessive accessorizing partygoers went through. Take note, fraternities of America, commitment to the shtick is the key to a classy toga party. No one at this shindig ripped unwashed sheets off a bed and sauntered off to the White House. President Roosevelts birthday was not all fun and games. One of FDRs closest friends established the National Committee for Birthday Balls. Its purpose was to host parties across America to celebrate the Presidents birthday, but also to raise money for a therapeutic center in Warm Springs, Georgia.  Polio patients such as FDR would visit the center for rehabilitation and treatment. The FDR library says that hundreds of events raised more than $1 million dollars for the center the year of FDRs toga bash.  Roosevelt died in Warm Springs in 1945 at the age of 63."
Sessions says he plans to testify before Senate intelligence panel,CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/10/2017,"(CNN) Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Saturday that he plans to testify before the Senate intelligence committee Tuesday, but it was not immediately clear if he would testify in public or private. The move is a prominent switch from his previous plans to testify publicly on the Justice Departments budget and puts him more directly in the firing line over questions about his contacts with the Russian ambassador to the United States and a federal investigation into Russian attempts to influence the 2016 election. Sessions had been scheduled to testify Tuesday before the House and Senate subcommittees that oversee his departments budget, but Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein will go before them instead, he said Saturday in letters to the chairmen of those subcommittees. Some members have publicly stated their intention to focus their questions on issues related to the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, from which I have recused, and for which the deputy attorney general appointed a special counsel,  Sessions wrote.   The Senate intelligence committee is the most appropriate forum for such matters, as it has been conducting an investigation and has access to relevant, classified information, he added. Sessions recused himself from overseeing the federal Russia probe three months ago after The Washington Post reported on a pair of undisclosed meetings Sessions had during the campaign with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador.  In a statement Thursday, however, the Justice Department said Sessions recused himself in light of his participation in President Donald Trumps campaign, and it was for that reason, and that reason alone. CNN later reported that congressional investigators have been probing whether Sessions had a possible third, undisclosed meeting with Kislyak. Former FBI Director James Comey hinted in his public hearing Thursday that Sessions, a former US senator from Alabama, may have had additional contacts with Russians, and said in a closed hearing that investigators had received Russian intercepts detailing a possible third meeting between Sessions and Kislyak, sources familiar with the briefing told CNN on Thursday. But federal investigators have not confirmed the meeting happened, and the Justice Department has denied it occurred. The Department of Justice appointed special counsel to assume responsibility for this matter, said department spokesperson Sarah Isgur Flores, referring to the appointment of former FBI Director Robert Mueller to oversee the departments Russia probe. We will allow him to do his job. It is unfortunate that anonymous sources whose credibility will never face public scrutiny are continuously trying to hinder that process by peddling false stories to the mainstream media. The facts havent changed The   did not have any private or side conversations with any Russian officials at the Mayflower Hotel. Sessions said Saturday that he was accepting an invitation from the Senate intelligence committee, although that was not immediately confirmed. He would likely face questions from senators not only about meetings with Kislyak and subsequent recusal from the federal Russia probe, but also about his involvement with the Presidents firing of Comey last month considering Sessions recusal from the Russia investigation, which Comey had been leading."
Pence family cat Oreo passes away,CNN,Elizabeth Landers,6/10/2017,"(CNN) After a   week in Washington, Vice President Mike Pence privately handled a loss at home: the death of their family cat, Oreo. Second lady Karen Pence tweeted photos of the family pet, adding, Rest in peace Oreo. You touched a lot of hearts in your little life. The photos included shots of the Vice President in a tuxedo holding the    feline, who moved with the family to the vice presidents residence on the grounds of the Naval Observatory after the election. An aide to the vice president said Oreo was 13 years old and was especially endeared to the Pences youngest daughter, Audrey, who is 23. In a White House absent of pets and animals, the second family has filled the void with several family pets, including a bunny, Marlon Bundo, which is also black and white and has garnered a national following and even appeared at official White House events. Oreo and Pickles, the other family cat, lived in the governors mansion in Indianapolis while Pence was governor of the state. The whole family moved to the Naval Observatory in January."
The original Catwoman pays tribute to her Batman,CNN,Alexandra King,6/10/2017,"(CNN) Actress Julie Newmar, who played Catwoman alongside the late Adam Wests Batman, paid tribute to her   Saturday, calling him the finest Batman ever. West, the star of the popular and campy 1960s Batman TV show, died on Friday after a short battle with leukemia, his agent said. He was 88. People adored him. Long lines of people stood to get his autograph, Newmar recalled to CNNs Fredricka Whitfield. To Wests fans, she emphasized he was more than just a TV star. A friend called me up this morning and said to me with tears in his voice, that Adam West was the father that we wanted, she said. He was always very charming and open and available, she added. Newmar described West as adorable and very present, as well as a master of finding  the humor in the character of Batman. He had that extra intelligence called wit, which allows us to live in this world above things and laugh at it, she said. Though the character of Batman went on to be played by actors such as Michael Keaton, George Clooney and Christian Bale in   movies, Newmar argued that the TV shows more simple approach to the character had made West particularly appealing to fans. He did not have to have his shoulders built up. He wasnt a fake Batman or an over costumed Batman. I think he was the real thing, she emphasized. I think he was and will be    and always will be    the finest Batman ever, she said."
Reporters notebook: Visiting the disappearing Tangier Island,CNN,Jennifer Gray,6/9/2017,"With only 450 residents, Tangier Island is what many would call a hidden gem.  I certainly thought so when I first arrived.   We took an hour ferry ride from Reedville, Virginia, to this tiny island in the middle of the Chesapeake Bay, 93 miles from Washington. Arriving in the harbor, we saw crab houses resting on piers, crab traps stacked high, one on top of another, a dozen fishing boats moored in the harbor and a few people waving hello on the docks.  The islands quirky little town doesnt have any cars. Bikes and golf carts are the modes of transportation, and everybody knows everybody.   Its an island that prides itself on its rich history. The island was discovered in 1608 and many of the residents are descendants of the very first settlers on the island. We watched crabbers unload their traps, school children leaving for school and restaurants serve up delicious crab cakes as they always have.  It was hard to believe that this lively island is on the brink of   within the next two decades. Thats when we saw a    girl selling homemade slime (a silly putty like concoction) to raise money to Save Tangier. Tangier Island is losing roughly 15 feet of coastline per year. It is now only 1. 3 square miles and is shrinking more and more every day. The residents here are extremely scared that if something isnt done soon, their homes and livelihoods will be washed away by the Chesapeake Bay.  Weve depended on the Chesapeake Bay for a couple hundred years or more, and now its the Chesapeake Bay thats the greatest threat to our existence,  says James Ooker Eskridge, the mayor of Tangier. Hes a waterman just like many of the men on the island and knows its only a matter of time before its too late.  He firmly believes that Tangier can be saved, but help has to come very soon.   During the hurricane season were just holding our breath and were just praying that we dont get a storm, Eskridge says. The more I talked to the people on this island, the more it dawned on me how vulnerable this place is    in more ways than just   rise.  I spoke with Earl Swift, who is writing a book about Tangier.  He has lived on the island part time for the last two years and said, if you make the decision that whether or not you save a place is simply a function of headcount, then Tangier doesnt have a chance.   Its a harsh, but true, reality for the people here. Are we only going to save the big cities like Miami, New Orleans, Boston and New York    and let all the small towns wash away because they dont have enough people? That moment gave me a jolt because if we lose the small towns and only save the big cities, we lose so much more than places that people call home. We lose history, tradition and pieces of the foundation this country was built upon.  Swift added that if this is true, its a dangerous slope to start sliding down because then you find yourself having to come up with what number is the baseline, and that would be a real shame to see us get to that point.   percent of the island voted for  President Trump. It doesnt bother them that he pulled out of the Paris climate agreement. The residents on Tangier look at the decision as more money it will free up to help them build the infrastructure they need to save their island.   When I asked people their thoughts on climate change, everyone had the same answer. They said it doesnt matter whats causing it. They are sick of hearing debates about   or natural cycles. They want people to open their eyes and see whats happening to Tangier. They say at this point the cause is irrelevant    the water is rising fast, and its rising now.  I agree with the science behind   rise and global warming but its all irrelevant to us right now. Were worried about washing away, resident Bruce Clark Gordy said. Before leaving the island, we took a boat ride up to a place about a mile and a half from Tangier called the Uppards.  What used to be a thriving community is now nothing more than a strip of sand. We took a walk along the shores of Uppards with Tangier resident Carol   as she does every day. The only signs there was once life here were the tiny spice bottles we found washed ashore, broken pieces of pottery and even cracked headstones. The grave we saw was Polly Parks, whose descendants live in Tangier now, according to Carol.   Carol says she realizes there is a good chance that one day someone will be walking along the abandoned shores of Tangier, picking up the pieces of her life, as she does the Uppards.   As the days go by, the residents here wont give up hope that help will be here someday to save their tiny island.  But they know the reality is time is running out. And its a burden their mayor knows all too well. He may be the last generation to call this tiny gem home.   The island disappearing.  Its on everybodys mind when they wake up and when they go to bed. Its always in the back of your mind. Sure is, always."
Tancredo: Have Congressional Republican Leaders Joinedthe Resistance? - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tom Tancredo,6/9/2017,"William F. Buckley, Jr. ran for mayor of New York City in 1965, he was asked, What will you do if you win? His reply: Demand a recount.  Of course, he was being flippant. The young Conservative Party of New York had no chance of winning even a plurality in the liberal bastion of New York. [I would not have been surprised to have heard Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell utter those words in October of 2016. Not only did they expect Trump to lose to Hillary Clinton in a landslide, they were counting on it. In a divided government, with a Democrat in the White House and Republican majorities in the Senate and House, governing the country was a matter of bipartisan       and they were in the drivers seat. No one could hold them accountable for actually governing the country   what a deal!  What a creepy bunch of establishment swamp denizens the Congressional Republicans have shown themselves to be. Precious days are being wasted by them because every passing   news cycle makes it more difficult to advance the Presidents agenda. And they know it.   And I think they are okay with that because it is not their agenda. They are wallowing in the swamp Trump is trying to drain. Of course, there are a few true believers who would brave the slings and arrows of the irrational ninnies in the media who live only to see Trump and his agenda be sent to the ash heap of history. However far too many of those calling themselves Republicans are no more than Democrats who have perfected their ability to obfuscate. It is clear to me that some Republicans in Congress secretly embrace the resistance and are hoping Trump will quit or be impeached. It seems Democrats are always eager to enact the Democrat agenda.  Whats so frustrating is that so are many Republicans!  Republicans have maintained their House majority since the turnaround election of 2010. In November of 2016, besides sending Donald Trump to the White House, Republicans maintained their majorities in both the Senate and House and also won control of a majority of governorships and state legislatures.  The Republican Party now controls 69 of 99 state legislative chambers (Nebraska is unicameral) and 33 governorships, the most it has held since 1922. Republicans will have total control of government (legislative chambers and governorship) in 25 states, the most since 1952. Consider this startling fact: with Donald Trump in the White House, the Republican Party today has more control over Congress than Eisenhower had in 1953, Nixon in 1969, or Ronald Reagan in 1981. Reagan never had a Republican majority in both houses of Congress! These amazing numbers send a clear message: it is now time to govern! If not now, when? But to judge by Republican behavior since November, the Grand Ol Party cant handle success and seems to be working hard to surrender the reins of power. In the last month, we have heard Senator McConnell and Speaker Paul Ryan say they dont think they have the votes for repealing Obamacare, reforming the tax code and securing the borders. Translated, that means they believe they dont have the Republican votes to pass landmark Republican bills. My 10 years of experience in the Congress tells me that this is total hogwash. When you have both houses of Congress and the White House, there is no excuse for failure     even when you dont have a   60 votes in the Senate. Besides the various parliamentary rules that can be employed when you have the majority on every committee as well as the floor, the sausage factory model of legislation is always available. A good example is the Republican enactment of the Medicare Prescription Drug Act of 2003. That historic expansion of Medicare was a horrible bill and every Republican knew it. But President Bush wanted it and the Republicans held both Houses, albeit by only one vote in the Senate. That 2003 battle is described here. The bill came to the floor for a vote late in the evening, but when the vote was called, what was supposed to be a   vote turned into an       because leadership did not have the necessary 218 Yeas.  Democrats didnt want to give Bush and the Republican Party the win, and about half the Republicans saw the bill for what it was     the single biggest increase in government since Medicare. It stunk. That was when the real lobbying     that is, the arm twisting     started. The president was calling members about 5 a. m. and badgering them   mainly with yummy carrots but also some big sticks. Every Cabinet member was dispatched to the House to lobby members with whom they had influence. The House Republican leadership team was actually calling the largest donors to the recalcitrant members and asking them to call their reluctant representatives and urge them to change their vote. A colleague of mine who was a subcommittee chair had his chairmanship threatened. Sufficient golden promises and nasty threats were made, and by 6:30 a. m. they had the 218th vote. I was a No vote, but I still wanted to throw up. Apparently, keeping Republican promises made in every national election since 2010 by repealing Obamacare is not as important to the Republican Party leadership in 2017 as expanding Medicare by $400 billion was in 2003.  And these geniuses wonder why Republican voters chose Donald Trump over Jeb Bush, Lindsay Graham and John Kasich? Gimme a break! If Republicans cannot unite to repeal the single biggest federal power grab of the last 50 years, why should anyone have faith they will have the courage to tackle other looming crises?  The message being sent to Republican rank and file voters across the country is pathetic: Elect us and we will slow down the growth of the leviathan state but we lack the courage to reverse course. That, my friends, is a suicide note.  Senate Republican leadership is also skeptical they can find the money  Trump has requested for the first stage of a border wall. They have put off a decision on the matter until September. The truth is they dont want a border wall!  That leadership and many of their   caucus members are happy with the status quo when it comes to immigration. Cheap labor will satisfy the Chamber of Commerce Republicans and thereby keep the donations from big business flowing to their reelection campaigns.   But it is not just Trumps immigration plans that they secretly want derailed, its the whole conservative agenda that they speak so glowingly of to their constituents at home but work so hard to avoid implementing when they are back in the swamp."
Wall Street just got some terrible news from the Comey testimony,Business Insider,Bob Bryan,6/9/2017,"While there was plenty of news to chew on from former FBI   Director James Comeys  on   Thursday, its clear the investigation into Russias influence on   the 2016 election, and whether there was collusion with President   Donald Trumps campaign, is far from over.     That means nothing good for Wall Street.     Isaac Boltansky of the   firm Compass Point told   Business Insider that Comeys testimony proved nothing would be   resolved anytime soon, delaying hope for Wall     reforms like bank deregulation or .     The hearing was in line with expectations, and the market   appears to have shrugged it off for the time being, Boltansky   said in an email after the testimony. From a markets   perspective, my concern remains that this issue is beginning to   dominate the congressional bandwidth, which is a headwind for   advancing the GOPs   agenda.     Chris Krueger of Cowen Washington Research Group agreed with the   assessment that while the hearing did not reveal a lot of new   information or change the investigation in any large way, it put   the legislative agenda on hold.      Slows everything down, Krueger told Business Insider. The only   thing moving on the Hill with any velocity, momentum, or   bipartisanship is investigations.     Krueger also said that while tax reform, Wall Streets favorite   policy proposal on Trumps agenda, was on a separate track from   the investigation, Comeys testimony and similar events delays   that engine.     Investors have been anxiously awaiting an overhaul of the tax   code because tax cuts would drive down costs for corporations and   most likely lead to higher profits, and thus higher stock prices.     Can still get done, but Congress must clear healthcare and the   [fiscal 2018] budget sequentially and avoid a shutdown and a   default due to the debt ceiling        just to get to tax on the   table, Krueger said in an email.  While there was plenty of news to chew on from. .."
"Trump Empowers States with Massive Permitting Reform in First Step to Renewing Americas Roads, Rails, Runways and Rivers - Breitbart",Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/9/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     President Donald Trump wrapped up infrastructure week at the Department of Transportation on Friday, highlighting his moves to reform what the White House called a burdensome regulatory system that has left American infrastructure crumbling. [Trump began his visit with a roundtable where state DOT heads described the hindrances that the current permitting process impose on their infrastructure projects. The heads of state Departments of Transportation, U. S. Department of Transportation leaders, and White House senior officials participated in the discussion along with hosts Transportation Sec. Elaine Chao and Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke.  From the DOT atrium, Trump spoke to members of Congress, representatives of the transportation community, heads of state Departments of Transportation, and U. S. Department of Transportation staff. Trump spoke of Thursdays infrastructure summit at the White House which involved Secs. Chao and Zinke. They met with state and local leaders to develop plans to replace Americas decaying infrastructure and to construct new roads, rails, pipelines, tunnels, and bridges all across our nation.  The President continued: We are here today to focus on solving one of the biggest obstacles to creating this new and   infrastructure     and that is the painfully slow, costly and   process for getting permits and approvals to build. And I also knew that from the private sector. It is a long, slow, unnecessarily burdensome process. My Administration is committed to ending these terrible delays once and for all.  The excruciating wait time for permitting has inflicted enormous financial pain on cities and states all throughout our nation     and has blocked many important projects from ever getting off the ground. Trump added that the Dakota Access Pipeline was dead 120 days ago and now it officially just opened for business.  He also noted excitement at the labor union representatives from the North American Building Trades Union and the Laborers International Union of North America that were present for the event. You will play a central role in rebuilding America, said Trump.   He gave examples of how belabored the process to building infrastructure has gotten: It took only 4 years to build the Golden Gate Bridge and 5 years to build the Hoover Dam and less than one year to build the Empire State Building, people dont believe that, took less than one year     but today it can take 10 years and far more than that just to get the approvals and permits needed to build a major infrastructure project. These charts beside me are actually a simplified version of our highway permitting process. It includes 16 different approvals involving 10 different federal agencies being governed by 26 different statutes. Trump them spoke of a conversation that happened just   prior, with a gentleman from Maryland and a project for an   road. They spent $29 million dollars for an environmental report weighing 70 pounds and costing $24, 000 per page, said Trump who then moved to the side and showed the massive binders containing the report. Trump continued: Why should we continue to accept what is so clearly unacceptable? Often times for consultants that are making a fortune because you cant do anything without hiring them, paying them a tremendous amount of money. Having them write up this nonsense. You cant get approvals. I was not elected to continue a failed system     I was elected to change it, said Trump. He assured stated and local leaders, help is finally, after many, many decades, on its way, pledging to give control, back to the cities and the states.  Trump remarked that these governing bodies know best how to plan their communities, analyze their projects and protect their local environment. He then announced a new Council to help project managers navigate the bureaucratic maze.  The Council will create a new online dashboard to track major projects through the approval process and will make sure that every federal agency that is consistently delaying projects by missing deadlines will face tough new penalties.  The Administration is also forming a new office within the Council of Environmental Quality. Trump announced that this office will work to root out inefficiency, clarify lines of authority, and streamline federal and state, local procedures so that communities can modernize their aging infrastructure without fear of outdated federal rules getting in the way.    President Trump said this massive permit reform is so important, but only the first step in renewing Americas roads, rails, runways, and rivers.  He referred to his recent comments in Cincinnati, Ohio, speaking of his new vision for American infrastructure will generate $1 trillion dollars in infrastructure investment.  State and local leaders will have more power to decide which projects get built, when they start and how they are funded, said Trump. And investors will have a much more predictable environment that encourages them to invest billions of dollars in capital that is currently stuck on the sidelines. Together we will build projects to inspire our youth, employ our workers and create true prosperity for our people.  Follow Michelle Moons on Twitter @MichelleDiana"
"Blumenthal: If Sessions had 3rd, undisclosed Russian meeting, could be perjury",CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Richard Blumenthal said Thursday that if Attorney General Jeff Sessions did have a third, undisclosed meeting with Russias ambassador to the United States, it could be perjury. CNN reported earlier Thursday that fired FBI Director James Comey told senators in a closed hearing that Sessions may have had a third interaction with Russias ambassador to the US, according to people familiar with the briefing. Comey explained that the possibility there could have been another encounter was not something he wanted to discuss in the earlier public hearing, according to a source familiar with the briefing. I cant confirm what may have been provided in a classified setting, but with a third meeting, even without it, what we have is a pattern of contacts with the Russians by (Michael) Flynn, by Sessions, by (Jared) Kushner    secret and then concealed, the Connecticut Democrat told CNNs Erin Burnett on OutFront on Thursday.  It could be perjury, he added. CNN reported that Comey told senators in the closed hearing that Sessions may have had a third interaction with Sergey Kislyak. That information is based in part on    intercepts, and Kislyak might have exaggerated the encounter, sources said. CNN previously reported exclusively that congressional investigators are examining whether Sessions had an additional private meeting with Russias ambassador during the presidential campaign, according to Republican and Democratic Hill sources and intelligence officials briefed on the investigation. The Justice Department reiterated on Thursday no such meeting took place. Blumenthal said Sessions is emerging more and more as a key figure in the Russia investigation. Not only because of his problematic contact with Russians, he said, but also because he failed to safeguard and protect the FBI as part of the Department of Justice when he learned about the meeting in which the President of the United States in effect had inappropriate conversations with Director Comey."
Trump: Qatar must stop funding terrorism,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump called on Qatar to stop funding terrorism, claiming credit for and endorsing the decision of Gulf nations to ostracize their neighbor, even as US Cabinet officials said their blockade is hurting the campaign against ISIS.  We had a decision to make, Trump said, describing conversations with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. Do we take the easy road or do we finally take a hard but necessary action? We have to stop the funding of terrorism. In doing so, the Presidents tone, if not his message, clashed with his most senior national security officials, highlighting the often mixed messages emerging from his administration since the Qatar crisis began Tuesday. Hindering the ISIS campaign  The three Sunni Gulf countries    Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE    moved with Egypt to cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar, host to the one of the Pentagons largest military bases in the Middle East and a linchpin in the fight against ISIS.  Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, speaking to reporters shortly before Trumps remarks, said the Gulf countries land and air blockade of Doha is hurting the campaign against ISIS, an assessment Pentagon officials only partially corroborated.  The blockade is hindering US military actions in the region and the campaign against ISIS, Tillerson said, without providing details. The US expectation is that these countries will immediately take steps to resolve the situation, he added.  In a sharp contrast to Trumps tone and messaging, Tillerson called on Gulf nations to   the crisis with Qatar, citing humanitarian, economic and military costs. We ask that there be no further escalation by the parties in the region, Tillerson said Friday. He called on Qatar to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors.  Saudi Arabia and its counterparts accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region because of its ties to their Shiite rival, Iran, and its support for groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas. Qatar acknowledges its links to these groups, but denies that it supports terrorism. The Emir of Qatar has made progress in halting support for and financing of terrorist groups, Tillerson said, but he must do more and do it quickly. Trump, in contrast, was much more explicit in condemnation. The nation of Qatar has historically been a funder of terrorism at a very high level, he said, speaking from the Rose Garden.   I decided, along with secretary of state Rex Tillerson, our great generals and military people, the time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding, they have to end that funding and its extremist ideology, Trump said.  The President said he helped those countries make the decision to break off relations with Qatar during his trip to Saudi Arabia last month. Nations came together and spoke to me about confronting Qatar over its behaviors, he said.  A White House official pushed back on the notion that Trump and Tillerson are not on the same page, saying of the President that what he said was consistent with what secretary of state said. While the official said that the president believes that the issue can be resolved on terms favorable to the United States and United States interests, that official also added that, I havent heard him express concern about the issue of the base. The official didnt address Tillersons claims that the blockade was hurting the   campaign, according to pool reports distributed by the White House. Despite Tillersons assessment that the fight against ISIS had been impacted, Pentagon officials said there has been no immediate disruption. They warned, however, that their ability to make   plans was being affected.  Qatar is home to 11, 000 US troops and the Al Udeid Air Base, the main regional center for air operations against the terrorist group.  The Gulf nations have cut air and land access to Qatar, with some moving to close their airspace to flights on the way to Qatar, but US military officials said their operations continue without interruption. Regular supplies are moving into the base there via air, said US Navy Capt. Jeff Davis, a Pentagon spokesman. Davis said the Defense Logistics Agency is looking at a number of contingencies if the thing should come about, but at this point theres no impact on our operations. Qatar remains critical But Davis added that while current operations from Al Udeid Air Base have not been interrupted or curtailed, the evolving situation is hindering our ability to plan for longer term military operations. Qatar remains critical for coalition air operations in the fight against ISIS and around the region. Tillerson addressed criticism that the other Gulf countries including Saudi Arabia are also complicit when it comes to backing or fueling extremism. Others must do more to eliminate support for violent extremists within their own borders, Tillerson said, calling for progress toward eliminating all forms of support for terrorism: military, financial, moral or ideological. Tillerson also noted that the Gulf countries    all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council and all involved in the fight against ISIS    have to stay unified for the sake of that effort. Calls to Gulf leaders over the past few days have left him convinced theres a resolution, he said.  Its clear to me based on these conversation that the elements of a solution are available, Tillerson said. We know youre stronger together. Unlike Trump, Tillerson stressed the possibility of reconciliation and pointed to the human cost of the   blockade, mentioning shortages of food, the way families had been separated and they way some children have been pulled out of school.  Unintended consequences We believe these are unintended consequences, especially during the holy month of Ramadan, Tillerson said, referring to the most important holiday on the Muslim calendar. They can be addressed immediately, he said.  The White House official said that despite the fact that Trump didnt mention it, the President is, in fact, concerned about the humanitarian situation in Qatar, particularly the separation of families and food shortages. The official added, easing those restrictions not the same as complete diplomatic relations. The blockade is also impeding US and other international business activities in the region, Tillerson said, creating hardship for the people of Qatar and people whose livelihood depends on doing business with Qatar. Tillerson said that the US will throw its weight behind efforts by the Emir of Kuwait to act as a mediator to bring about a resolution to the crisis, which was reportedly sparked by an interview with the Qatari leader that Qatar said was a false news story. CNN is reporting that US investigators believe Russian hackers may have been behind the effort, and the FBI has been sent to Qatar to help probe. The US stance on Qatar has been roiled has by the mixed messages from the start. Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis have emphasized the need for Gulf unity and the importance of the US partnership with Qatar, home to the Al Udeid Air Base, the main regional center for air missions against ISIS. Trump has taken a starkly different tack, initially praising the move by Gulf nations to sever diplomatic relations with Doha before reversing course on Wednesday. In a Wednesday phone call with the Qatari Emir, Trump extended an olive branch, offering to help the parties resolve their differences with a White House meeting if necessary, and offered the services of Tillerson as a mediator.  Qatars ambassador to the United States, Meshal Hamad AlThani, tweeted that  Qatars principles and foreign policy reject the false ideology of terrorism. Qatar has been working with the US on combating terrorism for years, he said. We appeal to the US administration to rely on their own sources and not on countries with political agendas, he said."
"Digging in for long haul, Trump hits mute",CNN,Kevin Liptak,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) One minute before noon Thursday, just as the FBI director he fired was imploring him on national television to release secret tapes of their White House meetings, President Donald Trump strode from the Oval Office to his idling car and was whisked from the South Lawn. On the surface at least, it was business as usual for Trump, who was due to deliver a speech to a gathering of Christian conservatives at a hotel across town. Inside the building he was departing, however, and across the city he traversed, the outlines of a new reality were emerging. The old standbys of a   Washington    hired lawyers delivering statements far from the White House,   stakeouts outside officials homes,   in the White House briefing room    were dusted off, with little expectation they will be packed up soon. Opening act, For the President and his aides, the spectacle on Capitol Hill Thursday amounted to less of a climax and more of an opening act in a show almost everyone believes wont close soon. Neither entirely vindicating nor wholly indicting, Comeys testimony instead just led to more questions for a President who has prepared himself for prolonged battle. Trump, according to people familiar with his thinking, has braced for many more months of   hearings, damaging leaks and salacious revelations related to his campaigns ties to Russia. Furious by a controversy he regards as threatening his legitimacy, Trump has dug in. Were under siege, Trump declared at the evangelical conference, referring to the religious right but nonetheless summarizing his bunker state of mind. But we will come out bigger and better and stronger than ever. At the White House, the day began with relative optimism. Aides who entered the week uneasy about what Comey might say during his hotly anticipated testimony were cheered by an advance statement that contained, in their minds, little new information about the Presidents interactions with the former FBI director.   On Wednesday night, Marc Kasowitz    the lawyer Trump hired to handle the Russia investigation    was seen at the Trump hotel celebrating by buying a box of cigars. We won. Trumps in the clear, Kasowitz was overheard saying, according to two sources. Its clear Trump didnt do anything wrong. Afterward, White House officials offered similarly upbeat assessments of the testimony, which was carried on almost every major television network. For all of the hype this is the equivalent of Geraldo opening Al Capones vault, said one senior White House official, referencing the 1986 hyped TV special where journalist Geraldo Rivera discovered nothing in what supposed to be a secret hiding place of gangster Al Capone. I think Geraldo opening the vault was more impactful. For all of the hype that this was to be explosive, nothing new has been learned, the official said. That assessment wasnt shared by Democrats or many legal observers, who argued that Comeys descriptions of his meetings with Trump    during which Comey claims Trump asked him to pledge loyalty and end a probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn    amount to obstruction of justice. Comey made those assertions under oath, but Trumps lawyer said Thursday they were false. Its not a dispute that will be easily resolved, meaning the questions will continue to linger over Trump and his White House.   reality, With the   reality of the Russia controversy in mind, Trumps advisers took steps to make Thursday appear routine, despite the tsunami of anticipation around Comeys appearance before the Senate intelligence panel. Their primary target: Trump himself, who they hoped could be coaxed into letting the testimony proceed without a   response on Twitter. Aides and advisers had wondered before Comeys testimony if their boss would react to the display. Before the event began, some administration officials warned that Trump would be watching the hearing along with the rest of the country.  Twitter, they acknowledged with trepidation, is never far from the Presidents fingers when hes watching television. On Thursday morning, Trumps outside legal team did convene in the West Wing as the testimony got underway. Trump himself was stationed in his private dining room, steps from the Oval Office, to watch on his large   television as a   Comey was sworn in. But instead of settling in, Trump decamped for the Oval Office, where he met for national security discussions with his team about North Korea and an unraveling situation in the Arab Gulf. Sean Spicer, Trumps press secretary, said the President did not watch much of Comeys testimony, only catching clips between his meeting, which lasted almost until the president was on his way to the evangelical speech. He did not offer online commentary to the cable news coverage, and when he was questioned about the testimony during an infrastructure meeting with mayors and governors, he declined to answer. A White House aide said Trumps advisers, including Kasowitz, convinced him that responding on Twitter could undercut their ability to defend him to the public. But the aide warned an outburst could come later, after Trump consults with his large network of friends outside the White House.  Staffers exhale, Staffers nonetheless exhaled with a certain amount of relief after Comey concluded his   grilling without any major new revelations about the Trump campaigns connections to Russia. They were equally relieved the President didnt offer any angry reactions before they could vet his language. Instead, the machinery Trump set up to respond to the Russia questions kicked into gear. In a plain conference room at the National Press Club, several blocks from the White House, Kasowitz read from a prepared statement that accused Comey of leaking classified information about his interactions with the President. Trumps own White House staff insisted that life was proceeding as planned. In terms of the mood in the White House, I would say that its a regular Thursday at the White House, principal deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during an   briefing. Were carrying on. Still, several senior Republican operatives noted that no matter how the White House tries to spin it, the fact the former FBI director is testifying about his conversations with the President presents terrible optics.  It is hard to see this being viewed through any prism that this is good for Trump, said a senior Republican operative with ties to the Republican leadership. This is bad. It is all bad. Another GOP consultant expressed frustration at how the President and his administration has handled this situation. There is no way anyone in the White House can be looking at this, the (former) FBI director is on national television undermining the credibility of the president of the United States, in a way Americans havent seen, certainly this generation hasnt seen since the Watergate hearings, the consultant said."
Clapper on Comey testimony: The big story is Russian interference in our process,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, said Thursday that former FBI Director James Comeys testimony exposes Russian interference as the big story. The big story is Russian interference in our process, he told CNNs Anderson Cooper on AC360. And they exceeded their wildest dreams and expectations, Im sure, by the discord, doubt and disruptions they have caused in our political process. Clapper told Cooper he thinks the Russians are emboldened now to be even more aggressive. He said Watergate pales in comparison to the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Theyre not going to stop, he said. Clapper also made a striking statement about President Donald Trumps posture throughout his campaign and while in office. I think the President himself has undertaken    whether intentionally or not    assaults on our institutions, he said, pointing to times Trump spoke negatively about members of the intelligence community and individual judges as examples. When Cooper asked Clapper whether he feels the President is a threat to democracy, Clapper said he believes Trump is a threat to our system. The former DNI has previously said he believes Russia absolutely meddled in the 2016 election. However, when he testified before a Senate judiciary subcommittee, he said he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion between Trumps campaign and Russia. He said he had been unaware of an FBI investigation into the matter until Comey announced it publicly at a House hearing in March. On Thursday, Clapper commended Comeys testimony. During the   hearing, Comey answered questions about the FBIs Russia investigation, his private interactions with Trump and how he handled the Hillary Clinton email probe.  When Cooper asked if it comes down to a he said, he said about the substance of Comey and Trumps conversations, whom would he trust, Clapper answered that he trusts Comey over Trump. Theres absolutely no doubt in my mind that I have and always will trust the word and the integrity of Jim Comey, Clapper said."
Journalists felony indictment draws scrutiny to Inauguration Day arrests,CNN,Eli Watkins,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) A journalist was arraigned in Washington on Friday over charges stemming from protests on Inauguration Day. The journalist, Aaron Cant, was indicted last week by US attorney Channing Phillips on eight charges, including two felony violations of the Riot Act, according to court records. Cant was one of several hundreds at the protests in downtown Washington as President Donald Trump ascended to the nations highest office.  At the       protest by the group DisruptJ20, protesters and police clashed as the event grew increasingly heated that afternoon. DC authorities said they arrested 217 people and that six police were injured. Some of those arrested, including journalists, had their charges dismissed, although a   indictment came down in April charging more than 200 people with charges stemming from the protest, including inciting a riot, and several people for assaulting a police officer, expanding on charges laid out in February. A group of defendants opposing the charges, dubbed DefendJ20, filed a motion to dismiss the felony charges last week. Sam   a member of the group of activists and legal support workers helping the defendants, said more than 130 of those charged had pledged not to cooperate with the prosecution in any way that would hurt their  .  They understand that the charges are political,   said, accusing the prosecution of seeking an overly harsh sentence due to the nature of the protest. Cant declined to comment, citing the advice of his lawyers. His lawyers declined to comment on the record. The US attorneys office offered no comment in response to questions from CNN.   said he hoped for a response to the dismissal request before the end of September, when he said their motions are due. He also noted the defendants were at different stages in the judicial process. Some have already pleaded guilty, including Dane Powell, a Florida man who the US attorneys office announced in April pleaded guilty to charges of felony rioting and felony assault on a police officer.  According to BuzzFeed News, among those participating in the DefendJ20   pledge is Alexei Wood, a photojournalist who streamed footage of the protests and police on Facebook.  The Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press wrote Phillips, an Obama administration appointee, in late February arguing he should dismiss charges against Cant, noting other journalists had their charges dropped. Cant has written for several outlets, including the Baffler and The Intercept, and is currently a staff writer at the Santa Fe Reporter. Following Cants arraignment, a status hearing for his case has been scheduled for October 27 along with a motion hearing for April 6. His jury trial is set to begin on October 15, 2018. CORRECTION: This story has been updated to clarify  s relationship with DefendJ20."
Trump: Im willing to testify under oath about Comey claims,CNN,Dan Merica,6/9/2017,"Washington (CNN) A defiant President Donald Trump said Friday he was willing to testify under oath about his conversations with James Comey, further fueling the swirling controversy ignited by the fired FBI directors bombshell testimony before the Senate on Thursday. One hundred percent, Trump said when asked about his willingness to deliver sworn testimony. Trump aggressively addressed some questions during the bilateral news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis on Friday, but coyly answered others. Asked directly whether he was recording conversations in the Oval Office    a claim he hinted at on Twitter last month    Trump dodged. I am not hinting at anything. I will tell you about it over a very short period of time, Trump said, twice declining to elaborate. He later said reporters were going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer. The noncommittal response leaves the door open to White House tapes, something that legal experts say would fall within the purview of special counsel Robert Muellers investigation into Russias 2016 election meddling and the Trump campaigns potential role. Trump also indirectly accused Comey of perjury when he adamantly denied the fired FBI directors claim that the President asked him to end the FBIs investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn, a close Trump confidante. I didnt say that, Trump said. And he denied that he asked Comey for his loyalty, though he added: There would be nothing wrong if I did say it. But as much as Trump looked to undercut Comeys testimony, he also heralded some of his claims, namely his comment there was no evidence of collusion between Trump and the Russians and no investigation into Trump personally during his time at the FBI.  No collusion, no obstruction, hes a leaker, Trump said during a Rose Garden news conference, knocking Comey for disseminating the content of a memo he kept on a dinner he had with the President.  Trump concluded his team emerged very happy after Comeys testimony. The Rose Garden press conference was the first time since last month that Trump formally took questions from reporters. The brief news conference    where each President took four questions from the press    comes the day after Comeys bombshell Capitol Hill testimony in which the fired FBI director accused the White House of lies. Trump was publicly silent while Comey testified on Thursday, but tweeted an accusation Friday that Comey    whom Trump fired in May    lied under oath. Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication, Trump tweeted, and WOW, Comey is a leaker! Trumps comment tracked with Republican talking points about the hearing, where the Republican National Committee and White House urged surrogates to emphasize the fact that Comey clearly said the President was never an explicit subject of the Russia probe during his time at the FBI. But Comeys testimony about the President has darkened the clouds hanging over the White House. The former FBI director said Trumps private comments urging him to drop the probe into former national security adviser Michael Flynn led him to tell his Justice Department colleagues they needed to be careful. And he said multiple times that he choose to take detailed notes about his interactions with Trump because he worried the White House and President would lie about them if he didnt. Trump has remained relatively media shy since the Justice Department tapped former FBI Director Robert Mueller to be the special counsel looking into Russias meddling into the 2016 election and the Trump campaigns possible ties to it. The President last formally took questions on May 18, when he held a bilateral news conference    similar to the one that will happen Friday    with Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos."
Heres the biggest takeaway from James Comeys bombshell testimony to Congress,Business Insider,Natasha Bertrand,6/9/2017,"WASHINGTON     Former FBI Director James Comey  on Thursday that he felt President   Donald Trump fired him because of the Russia investigation,   raising further questions about whether the president obstructed   justice in dismissing Comey last month.     I know I was fired because of something about the way I was   conducting the Russia investigation, Comey told Sen. Jack Reed   of Rhode Island. I was in some way putting pressure on him, in   some way irritating him, and he decided to fire me because of   that.     He later added: Theres no doubt that its a fair judgment       its my judgment     that I was fired because of the Russia   investigation. I was fired, in some way, to change, or the   endeavor was to change, the way the Russia investigation was   being conducted. That is a very big deal, and not just because it   involves me. The nature of the FBI, and the nature of its work,   requires that it not be the subject of political consideration.     Comey told the committee in his opening remarks that he had been   confused and became increasingly concerned by Trumps   comments in the days after he was fired, which indicated that he   had been dismissed because Trump wanted to relieve pressure   from the investigation into whether his campaign colluded with   Moscow.     In an interview with NBCs Lester Holt shortly after firing   Comey, Trump admitted that the Russia thing was on his mind   when he fired Comey, adding that the FBI was in turmoil and in   need of a new director. He acknowledged that he was going to fire   Comey regardless of the recommendations given to him by Deputy   Attorney General Rod Rosenstein and Attorney General Jeff   Sessions.     Comeys testimony raises questions about whether Trump obstructed   justice in his interactions with the former FBI director,   beginning with a dinner on January 27, during which Comey said   Trump asked him for his loyalty.     Experts  on Wednesday that Comeys written remarks for   testimony, published on the committees website, absolutely   bolster the case for obstruction of justice.     Comey told the committee in both written and spoken testimony   that Trump asked him during an Oval Office meeting on February 14   to drop the investigation into former national security adviser   Michael Flynn. Comey told Sen. Jim Risch he took Trumps comment   that it was his hope the investigation could be dropped as a   direction.     I took it as: This is what he wants me to do, Comey told Risch.   When Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked him to elaborate, he said that   the context and the presidents words are what led me to that   conclusion.     Flynn had been forced to resign the day before, and the   controversy around Gen. Flynn at that point in time was centered   on whether he had lied to the vice president about the nature of   his conversations with the Russians, Comey said. When they met   on February 14, Comey said, the president made specific   reference to that. So thats why I understood him to be saying he   wanted me to drop any investigation connected to Flynns account   of his conversations with the Russians.     Comey said he told the president that Flynn was a good guy, but   he wouldnt commit to dropping the probe. Asked why he didnt   tell Trump in that moment that what he was requesting was   unethical, Comey told Feinstein that he was so stunned by the   conversation that I just took it in.     He added that he did not tell Sessions about the conversation,   which he took notes on, because he had information to suggest   that Sessions would soon recuse himself from the investigation.   But he told the committee he could not disclose that information   in a public session.     Sessions recused himself in late February after reports surfaced   that he had had more than one undisclosed conversation with   Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak.     Comey said he relayed the details of the conversation with his   chief of staff, the FBIs deputy director, the bureaus general   counsel, the deputy directors chief counsel, and the associate   deputy director. The head of the FBIs national security branch   was also apprised of the meeting, he said.     Comey told the committee that he documented his interactions with   Trump in memos because he was     WASHINGTON     Former FBI Director James Comey. .."
Austria to Ban Burqas from October,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/9/2017,"VIENNA (AFP)     New Austrian legislation came into force Friday that will ban the   Islamic veil in public places from October 1.

U.S. Flying Bombers Above Disputed South China Sea Irks Vigilant Beijing,Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/9/2017,"The U. S. military confirmed a military exercise by Air Force   Lancer bombers over the South China Sea Thursday, a move that prompted Beijing, which illegally claims most of the sea, to remind Washington that it remains vigilant before U. S. exercises. [China always maintains vigilance and effective monitoring of the relevant countrys military activities in the South China Sea, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a statement Thursday. Chinas military will resolutely safeguard national sovereignty, security and regional peace and stability.   The Chinese government typically responds to American exercises in the region rapidly. China claims almost the entire South China Sea, including the sovereign territories of Brunei, Malaysia, Vietnam, Taiwan, the Philippines, and the waters off the coast of Indonesia. The Permanent Court of Arbitration at the Hague ruled last year that Chinas claims on the Spratly and Paracel Islands   sovereign territory of Vietnam and the Philippines   were not valid, and China must cease its construction of military facilities in the region. China vowed to ignore the ruling and any other such international legal resolution. The United States has participated in challenging these illegal territorial claims through a variety of measures, from Freedom of Navigation Operations (FONOPs) within 12 nautical miles of the territory China claims, and military exercises both unilateral and joint with allied nations in the region. U. S. Pacific Command described the exercise on Thursday as part of a greater continuous bomber presence program, which included the participation of the bombers and the USS Sterett. According to an extensive report in the Japan Times, the mission lasted ten hours and was launched out of U. S. territory in Guam. The goal of the operation was to improve coordination between the ship and the bombers by refining joint tactics, techniques and procedures while simultaneously strengthening their ability to seamlessly integrate their operations, Pacific Command said. The statement explicitly did not refer to the operation as an FONOP. The report also did not address recent reports suggesting that the Chinese government has continued to expand its military presence in the region. The Pentagon recently submitted a report to Congress detailing advances in the militarizing of the Spratly Island chain. Chinas Spratly Islands outpost expansion effort is currently focused on building out the   capabilities of its three largest outposts   Fiery Cross, Subi and Mischief Reefs   after completion of its four smaller outposts early in 2016, the report read, according to the South China Morning Post. Once all these facilities are complete, China will have the capacity to house up to three regiments of fighters in the Spratly Islands.  Among the new facilities are 24   hangars,   positions and other   infrastructure on the reefs mentioned. The Chinese Foreign Ministry rejected the report. China pursues the path of peaceful development and a national defense policy. Chinas defense development is aimed at safeguarding state independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, spokeswoman Hua Chunying said this week, according to the   Global Times. As the report also mentioned potential Chinese expansion into Pakistan, Hua chided the United States and claimed cooperation with the Pakistani government is not targeted at any third party."
Poland Vows Referendum on Migrant Quota Amidst EU Pressure: The Publics Voice Will Be Heard - Breitbart,Breitbart,Virginia Hale,6/9/2017,"The publics voice will be heard, Polands president declared, as he vowed a referendum on the European Unions (EU) migrant quota amidst growing pressure from Brussels. [Describing the question of whether Poland should be forced to accept a quota of migrants from the third world as of vital importance for its future security, Andrzej Duda said the referendum could be held during parliamentary elections in 2019.  That would allow the new government to hear the clear voice of the nation on the issue, said the president. The conservative Law and Justice (PiS) governments position on the quota system is clear and unambiguous Duda said. He said maintaining the party does not agree with the [plan] and asserted that Poland does not consent to the forced relocation of refugees on our territory. Holding a referendum will also enable the publics voice to be heard over the voices of international organisations, Duda asserted. If Brussels continues to raise [the issue of migration] attempting to exert pressure and force on the Polish authorities, then public opinion will be extremely important, Duda promised. Polands latest display of opposition to the redistribution plan comes as the Czech Republic announced its withdrawal from the scheme, which has been fiercely contested in Central and Eastern Europe, with Hungary and Slovakia challenging the plans in court. In an interview with Czech tabloid Blesk published Tuesday, EU president   Juncker demanded all nations in Europe shoulder solidarity and responsibility when it comes to migration. Brussels was left humiliated last year when Hungarians were asked what they thought of EU plans to force on their nation migrants from the third world, as 95 per cent said they rejected the scheme. Earlier this month, Breitbart London reported that senior Polish MEP Ryszard Czarnecki announced the only proven method to avoid Islamist terror attacks is not to import Muslim migrants. When it comes to reducing the chances of Poland being hit by [Islamist] terror attacks, the only proven method is to not allow in Muslim migrants, the MEP told local radio after the London Bridge terror attack, which killed eight and injured at least 48 others."
NYT Defends Trump Article After Comey Calls it Not True,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/9/2017,"The New York Times Thursday was forced to defend itself Thursday from accusations of spreading fake news after fired FBI Director James Comey slammed an article the   paper of record published in February     calling it not true. [At a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing, Comey was asked about a story that featured in the Times on Valentines Day     Trump Campaign Aides Had Repeated Contacts With Russian Intelligence.  The story opened: Phone records and intercepted calls show that members of Donald J. Trumps 2016 presidential campaign and other Trump associates had repeated contacts with senior Russian intelligence officials in the year before the election, according to four current and former American officials. However, Sen. Jim Risch ( ) asked about the article at the hearing, Okay, so again, Risch said. So the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true, is that a fair statement? In the main, it was not true, Comey replied, before accusing the Times reporting team of not knowing what it was talking about. Again, all of you know this, maybe the American people dont. The challenge     Im not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information       [the challenge is] that people talking about it often dont really now whats going on and those of us who actually know whats going on are not talking about it.  And we dont call the press to say, hey, you got that thing wrong about this sensitive topic, Comey said. We just have to leave it there.  Sen. Tom Cotton, ( ) followed up, asking Comey if the story was almost entirely wrong. Comey said yes. The Times immediately tweeted that it was looking into Comeys statements. We are looking into James Comeys statements, and we will report back with more information as soon as we can. https:  .      The New York Times (@nytimes) June 8, 2017,  Eventually the Times published a report and support of its article late Thursday, noting that Comey did not say what it was about the article that was false. However, it had some ideas what Comey may have disputed: One possible area of dispute is the description of the Russians involved. Some law enforcement officials took issue with the Times account in the days after it was published, saying that the intelligence was still murky, and that the Russians who were in contact with Mr. Trumps advisers did not meet the F. B. I. s    standard of who can be considered an intelligence officer.  Another possibility, the Times said, was that he may have disagreed with the papers description of the evidence for the contacts with Russia     the Times said authorities had relied on phone records and intercepted calls to gain evidence. However, the Times noted that the reporters sources had stood by their accounts, and also pointed to subsequent reporting that it said backed up some of the claims made in the Feb. 14 article.

House Committee to James Comey: Hand Over the Memos,Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/9/2017,"The House Select Intelligence Committee Friday responded to fired FBI Director James Comeys testimony the previous day, demanding he hand over any memos of his conversations with President Trump. [The committee announced that Reps. Mike Conaway ( ) and Adam Schiff ( ) wrote to Comey in the wake of the testimony, requesting any notes or memoranda in his possession memorializing discussions Comey had with President Trump.  The request comes as part of the committees own investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election.  The request comes a day after Comey made the startling admission that he shared his memos with a friend at Columbia University so that he could then share them with the media and prompt a special counsel for the Russia investigation. It raised the question of why he shared them with a contact, and the media, but not with Congress. The most significant of the memos included one partially leaked to the New York Times, saying that Trump had asked Comey to end the investigation into former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn. I hope you can let this go, Trump reportedly said to Comey, according to the memo     parts of which were read to the Times. In May, Rep. Jason Chaffetz ( ) wrote to the FBI in his capacity as head of the House Oversight Committee, requesting copies of any such memos. The House committee also wrote to White House Counsel Don McGahn Friday, requesting any recordings or memos of the conversations that President Trump may have.

Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant are such good shooters they are destroying nets that are supposed to be indestructible,Business Insider,Cork Gaines,6/9/2017,"The Golden State Warriors are really good at shooting the   basketball.      OK, thats not a secret. But a nugget about the Warriors practice   facility  starts to put into perspective just how good the   Warriors sharpshooters are and just how much they work on their   craft.     In a story about the life and history of basketball nets in   general, Holmes notes that Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant   practice their shooting on the same basket at the Warriors   practice facility, with both working with assistant coach Bruce   Fraser.     During a typical practice, Curry will make about 250 shots, with   about   of those coming from   range. Durant   will make approximately 200 shots on a given day.

This startup wants to turn crazy-popular unboxing videos into a new QVC for millennials,Business Insider,Biz Carson,6/9/2017,"The former CTO of Hulu wants to build a company that can change   how Generation Z shops on mobile, creating what he likes to call   a QVC for Millennials.      Eric Fengs plan is built around one thing thats super   popular with  : Unboxing videos.      Its not just people opening up the packs, but user reviews and   comparisons, tutorials     the product review category is huge,    said.     On Thursday, Feng unveiled his new company, Packagd. The   startup plans to stream live video of the stars of unboxing   videos talking about new products. Consumers will be able to   watch the videos through Packagds apps and will be able to buy   the products that are mentioned by just tapping on a add to   cart button as the video plays.       Over the last year, Feng and his team have been working in   stealth to sign agreements with more than 20 YouTube stars   and strike partnerships with brands like Best Buy and Microsoft   to sponsor the videos.     Packagds business plan consciously drew inspiration from QVC,   the cable channel where hosts showcased new products that viewers   could order by calling a number displayed on their screens. Many   placed their orders and many more watched just for the   entertainment.     The live product demos are a bid to bring back the joy of   shopping, something that Feng feels like has been stripped in the   internet era.      Ecommerce has gotten so efficient that its not fun anymore,   said Feng, who is Packagds CEO. People dont window shop.   People dont shop with their friends. Amazon is relentless about   minimizing the number of pages that you see before purchase.     He continued: For us, we want to bring discovery. We want you to   have fun while youre shopping.     Feng, who is also a partner at venture capital firm Kleiner   Perkins, got the idea for Packagd   after learning  on YouTube. The top   5 unboxing channels on YouTube have over 33 million   subscribers combined, according to Fengs Kleiner partner   Mary Meeker.     YouTube has to cater to all kinds of different video creators and   types of content. As popular as the unboxing videos have   become, they could do even better if a company focused solely on   them, Feng bet.     So Feng and his team built Packagd to work just for     unboxers, . Feng thinks   Packagd can help them become as popular among young adults   on their mobile devices as QVC hosts have been among the   retirees glued to their TVs. And hes banking that they can help   sell products much like the hosts have done on QVC and Home   Shopping Network.        We want you to discover not just videos for products you know   about, but videos for products you dont know about. And have   those videos driving purchasing decisions, Feng said.     For its modern and mobile spin on QVC,  is starting with a six hour   block of live shows that it will stream through its app every   day.      These arent intended to be the Buy! Buy! Buy! The clock is   ticking down! style of infomercials you may see on TV. Instead,   Packagd is encouraging its new hosts to take a more informal   approach. Theyll chat with viewers live while streaming the   unboxing videos theyve already uploaded to YouTube. Feng   hopes the effect will be more like interacting with a friendly   expert than hearing a   sales pitch.     Unboxers we feel have cracked the code on this content type.   They created a content format thats super interesting, super   engaging, Feng said. Were not asking them to create new   videos. Were not asking them to adopt it for our platform. Were   saying we want to showcase them in a different way.     The company is starting with a new app called Unboxed that   focuses on reviews of tech products, ranging from drones,   laptops to smart home devices. Packagd plans to follow   Unboxed with an app focused on beauty product reviews that it   hopes to launch in two months. After that will come a toy review   app.      During each live show, the host will field questions   from Unboxed users who will be able to submit them using a   chat feature in the app. Users will be able to buy whichever   products the hosts are touting via a purchase button at the   bottom of their screens. If they do, theyll earn loyalty   points they can apply towards discounts on future purchases made   through Unboxed.     Such purchases will benefit the hosts as well; theyll get   affiliate commissions. And they wont have to share those with   Packagd. Instead, 100% of the affiliate revenue will go the   hosts, Feng said.      Packagd plans to make money by convincing brands to pay   to sponsor certain time slots of its live streams. Those partners   could either work with a product reviewer to build a show or   create their own. Either way, Unboxed service will work the same   for users. Theyll  be able to ask hosts questions and buy   what they see.      We want you to feel like youre in the live QVC audience and   talking to the host, Feng said. What drives a lot of   transactions on QVC is affinity with the host.     The company will offer users more to watch than just the six   hours of live, hosted videos. To accommodate users who may   not be interested in the product being touted at a particular   moment in the live stream, Unboxed will also   offer a library of   videos for a range of   products.         But Packagds apps will be missing something you normally find on   YouTube and on other video sites or apps: a search bar. Thats   intentional; Feng want to encourage users to browse products and   discover things serendipitously through the app rather than   accommodate shoppers who already know what they want to buy.     You dont turn on QVC when you know you want the DJI Spark,   Feng said.      Despite Fengs conviction that mobile shopping can be   transformed, he acknowledges the challenge Packagd faces.        While the companys been able to convince product reviewers to   host its video stream, it will have to lure in consumers too, and   they may be harder to attract. If theyre already watching   product videos on YouTube or finding products on Instagram,   they may not see the need to download a new app to get similar   information.      (Packagd plans to use product giveaways and a physical booth   at the electronics show, E3, to convince them to give the app a   try.)     Still, Feng is hopeful that if Packagd builds something   better for both unboxers and consumers, success will follow.   The company has already raised $7. 5 million from top Silicon   Valley venture capitalists, who are betting it will do for   unboxing videos what Twitch did for gaming.     Even though YouTube is the dominant player today, its investing   too widely and not focusing enough on translating its popularity   into purchases, Feng said. Thats where theres an opening for   Packagd, he added.      Im hoping the fact that these videos are so popular means there   is demand to consume them. I think the bigger existential   question is does that demand to consume those just stay on   YouTube? Feng said. It may. We may not be able to pull it off.   That may be a real competitive risk that we just cant solve. But   we wont know until we launch and try.   The former CTO of Hulu wants to build a company. .."
"Iran Turns Wrath on U.S., Saudi Over Terror Attacks",Breitbart,Breitbart Jerusalem,6/9/2017,"TEHRAN (AFP)      Irans supreme leader hit out at the United States and Saudi Arabia during the funerals Friday for those slain in the first attacks in the country claimed by the Islamic State group. [The assault by gunmen and suicide bombers Wednesday on Tehrans parliament complex and the shrine of revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini killed 17 people and wounded more than 50.  Mourners were paying respects to those killed at a ceremony in parliament on Friday morning, in the presence of newly   moderate President Hassan Rouhani. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei initially played down the attacks this week, describing them as firecrackers that will not have the slightest effect on the will of the people. At Fridays funeral, however, he turned his wrath for the attacks on the United States and Saudi Arabia, his countrys fiercest rivals. Such acts will have no other result than to reinforce hatred for the US government and its agents in the region, like the Saudi (government), Khamenei wrote in a message of condolence to the families of the dead. Parliament speaker Ali Larijani also attacked the United States and Saudi Arabia, which he called a tribal state very far from anything like a democracy. In a speech at the ceremony, Larijani denounced US sanctions against Iran over its ballistic missile programme. The US knows that the Revolutionary Guard and its Quds force are the most important regional forces fighting terrorists he said. The imposition of such sanctions demonstrates their alignment with terrorists in the region said the speaker, a moderate conservative. After prayers, a procession was to leave Tehran University for the    cemetery, near the Khomeini mausoleum 13 kilometres (eight miles) south of the Iranian capital. The attacks, which struck two of the countrys most symbolic landmarks, were carried out by five armed men, including suicide bombers who blew themselves up.     Attackers in new video     The intelligence ministry said they were Iranians who had joined the Islamic State group and travelled to its strongholds in Iraq and Syria before returning home. Iran is a key fighting force against IS and other groups in Iraq and Syria, and the Sunni jihadists consider Shiite Muslims to be apostates. Shiites make up roughly 90 percent of Irans population, but the country also has a sizeable Sunni minority, particularly around its restive borders with Iraq and Pakistan. IS released a video overnight of the five attackers before the assault, via its Amaq propaganda agency. Allah permitting, this is the first brigade that was established (in Iran) but it will not be the last, one of them said, as the group sat masked in a circle with their weapons. The jihadist group had earlier released footage of the attackers from inside the building, also via Amaq     a rare claim of responsibility while an assault was still going on. Although the US military is also fighting IS in Syria, as well as Iraq, President Donald Trump said in response to the attacks in Iran that the country is reaping what it sows. That drew fire from Irans foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, who tweeted: Repugnant WH (White House) statement       as Iranians counter terror backed by US clients.  Since Trump took office in January, relations between Washington and Tehran have worsened. Washington has imposed new sanctions on Tehran for its alleged support of terrorist groups in the Middle East, ballistic missile tests and human rights abuses. On a recent trip to   Saudi Arabia, Trump called on all nations to isolate Iran. The Islamic republics elite Revolutionary Guard has accused regional rival Saudi Arabia of involvement in Wednesdays attacks. But Intelligence Minister Mahmoud Alavi said on Thursday that we still cannot judge that Saudi Arabia has had a role in this terrorist incident."

"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand: If We Are Not Helping People, We Should Go the F*ck Home",Breitbart,Adam Shaw,6/9/2017,"Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand ( ) has been using some choice language in recent weeks, frequently dropping the F bomb, in a stark contrast to the 2016 campaign where Democrats lambasted   Trump for his language     and warned our children our watching. [Gillibrand, who has been floated as a possible 2020 candidate for the Democrats, spoke Thursday in front of a Personal Democracy Forum in New York City, and didnt hold back in what she thought of President Trump.  Has he kept his promises? No, F*ck No! , she said, according to The Hill. She also had a stark warning for other lawmakers, presumably including fellow Democrats, about being productive in Congress. If we are not helping people, we should go the f*ck home, she said. It isnt the first time Gillibrand has popped off in such a way. In April, she used a similar line in an interview with New York Magazine. In that instance, she also talked about being a newbie in the Senate and not knowing how to get a bill passed. How do I do this? I have no f*cking clue, she recalled for the magazine. It seems to be part of a wider strategy of Democrats to be edgier in the wake of their defeat in November. Democratic National Committee Chair Tom Perez, in April, said Trumps skinny budget was, in fact, a shi*ty budget.  The new   Democratic strategy is a stark contrast to a central pillar of their presidential campaign     including an ad called Our Children Are Watching in which young children were shown somberly watching President Trumps more colorful statements.

Brazilian President acquitted in illegal campaign funds case,CNN,Shasta Darlington,6/9/2017,"Rio de Janeiro  (CNN) Brazils top electoral court voted to acquit President Michel Temer and former President Dilma Rousseff following an investigation of allegations they received illegal campaign funds in the 2014 elections. The   decision gives Temer some breathing room, but he still faces a corruption investigation and street protests that threaten to force him from office before the next presidential elections in October 2018. Temer, 76, was the   candidate alongside Rousseff in 2014, but Rousseff was impeached last year for illegal fiscal maneuvers aimed at hiding the budget shortfall. She has denied the allegations.  The prospect of a second Brazilian president being forced out of office in less than a year has unsettled markets and investors. The Brazilian economy has started to crawl out of the worst recession on record, thanks in part to Temers efforts to push unpopular austerity measures through Congress. But with the corruption investigation heating up, it is not clear he will have the political backing to get key pension and other measures approved. Pension reform is certainly at risk, and as Temer continues to struggle for his survival in coming months some items on the agenda may be slowed, Christopher Garman of the Eurasia Group consultancy wrote in a report. Nonetheless, he said other reforms would likely move forward. The latest scandal broke last month. A secret recording surfaced on which Temer and Joesley Batista, the president of a multinational food processing company named JBS, can be heard talking about paying bribes. In a plea deal, Batista said Temer condoned the payment of hush money to silence a jailed legislator. Temer has denied the allegations and says the recording was doctored. But the scandal    just the latest development in the   Operation Car Wash corruption investigation that has implicated dozens of politicians from across the political spectrum    prompted new street protests. Temers approval rating is in the single digits and the Supreme Court has opened an investigation into alleged corruption and obstruction of justice. If Temer is ousted, power is handed to Congress, which will have up to 30 days to choose a caretaker president until new elections. In the meantime, the Car Wash investigation has already engulfed the major political players and business leaders    leaving the electoral field wide open."
Gohmert: Congress Recessing Day After Comey Testified Left President Trump To Dangle,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/9/2017,"Rep. Louie Gohmert ( ) told Fox and Friends on Friday that Congress concluding business on Thursday and not being in session on the day after fired FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee that he leaked information about his private conversations with President Donald Trump left the president to dangle. [House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthys office on Tuesday sent out an email announcing the change.  Members are advised that     pending timely completion of H. R. 10     votes are no longer expected in the House on Friday, June 9, the email stated. Last votes of the week are now expected at approximately 4:00 PM on Thursday, June 8.  The Majority Leaders office told Breitbart News that the decision was made because the Democrats withdrew all amendments from the Choice Act being considered by the House leading to business concluding a day early. But Gohmert said it sends the wrong message about Republicans support for Trump. Tuesday, apparently, our leadership changed the weeks scheduling and said lets go dark on Friday, which means the emphasis will not be on what were doing good in Washington, Gohmert said. We are basically leaving the president to dangle, Gohmert said. Im very concerned we are not being supportive enough to get the message out and here President Trump is        as [Senator] Marco Rubio was pointing out        the only thing that didnt leak was the truth     that [Trump] was not under investigation.  Meanwhile, at his weekly press briefing on Thursday, Ryan said he didnt have time to watch the Comey hearing but vaguely supported Trump by claiming he was new to the government and its modus operandi. As far as the conversations and all that, Im not going to speculate on any of this, I would just add that of course there needs to be a degree of independence between the DOJ, FBI and the White House and lines of communications established, Ryan told reporters. The presidents new at this, hes new to government, Ryan continued. So he probably wasnt steeped in the long running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses. Hes new to this, Ryan said. We now know why [Trump] was frustrated when the FBI director told him three times theres no investigation of him yet the speculation was allowed to continue, Ryan said. So obviously we know now why he was frustrated."

Its almost impossible for the Democrats to lose the electoral college, as you know. You have to run up the whole East Coast and win everything as a Republican, and thats what we did. So it was just an excuse. But we were very, very happy and, frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said and some of the things that he said just werent true. Thank you very much.

Caddell: Dishonest Anti-Trump Media Have Become Danger to Democracy,Breitbart,Dan Riehl,6/9/2017,"Pollster and analyst Pat Caddell spoke with Breitbart News Daily SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Friday about his reaction to Thursdays testimony by former FBI Director James Comey as well as the medias reaction. [I didnt think it was a great day for the media, said Caddell. However, if you watched some of the other cable news networks, youd think this was a disaster for Trump. It was anything but.  He went on to call out the media for pursuing a political agenda, as opposed to the truth, saying that media today is actually a danger to democracy.   The media really took it on the nose, he went on, pointing out that Trump was not lying about the three times he claims Comey told him he personally was not under investigation. How come that didnt leak out? That is an interesting question because enough people knew on Capitol Hill, and it tells me that it was the media. And this was really the chilling part, that they have their narrative agenda, that Trump is in collusion, Trump is this, and Trump is that, and hes under investigation. They did not want to challenge that narrative.  They werent reporting facts, continued Caddell. They were reporting sources who would give them statements that would contribute to their   narrative. This is not a press. This is a propaganda machine. Its full speed against the president.  Caddell said he could turn to almost any network and predict its coverage, If Trump walked on water, theyd say he couldnt swim.  They are so negative, as they were in the campaign, he went on. They havent let up, and they have invested themselves in a political result, not in telling the truth, and that is a danger to democracy.  Caddell said the press has damaged the very institution of the press by having decided to bring down a president versus report the truth, and Democrats are falling right into the path with them.  As for Trump and Comey, Caddell said, Comey basically vindicated him, first of all, on the question if there was collusion, or even on the Flynn matter     whether there was obstruction, and it just doesnt hold, he continued. Obviously, Mueller wouldnt let him testify if he thought there was an obstruction case.  Added Caddell, Comeys behavior is just bizarre. This man really believes that he is a demigod when it comes to the law. He keeps changing the goal lines. His weakness, which he confessed to, but I think it was more a device than a critical perception, whether it was with Loretta Lynch, when she asked him to conform to the Clinton campaign, which I thought was a revealing comment and opened up a lot of other doors, when he talked about his own leaking, volunteered how he had leaked and what he had done with those memos, I thought that was just really strange. His criticism of the media, he basically denied their stories. Hes basically a very angry man, and I thought the White House handled Comey terribly, but thats neither here nor there.  Caddell stated, He was the one in the meetings, and he never raised a protest, and then he said a sentence that I was stunned by. He said, I did it because I gave my friend the memo to give to the New York Times because I thought we needed a special counsel. Heres a man who wouldnt have a special counsel or wouldnt even investigate the IRS stuff, a person who didnt do it with Hillary Clinton, particularly in terms of the Clinton Foundation, and yet it was pointed out to him by a couple of the senators, you know, basically he gave her a whitewash. He wants to do this with Trump. I thought that was devastating and puts him in a very precarious place.  Caddell added, It chills me to think that this person was running the FBI.

"CNN, NYT Reporters Whine After Trump WH Relegates Them to Siberia Section - Breitbart",Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/9/2017,"On Friday, mainstream media reporters from the New York Times and CNN whined after President Donald Trumps White House relegated them to the rear of the Rose Garden during Trumps press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis.  We were in the equivalent of Siberia, no pun intended, when it comes to where we were seated, CNNs Jim Acosta reportedly said on Friday evening. That could be seen as an oversight on the part of the White House staff but it could also be seen as retaliation over the reporting were doing over here at CNN.  CNNs Wolf Blitzer said it was outrageous.  And Acosta, mustering up the courage mainstream media reporters never found while Barack Obama was president, said the poor seating assignments are not going to deter us from what were doing over here.  Breitbarts Matt Boyle has described Acosta as a vehemently   media figure in the heart of the opposition partys mothership CNN.  CNN was placed away from the other TV networks in the equivalent of Siberia (no pun intended) at todays news conference.     Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 9, 2017,  Of course, this may just be an oversight by WH staff. But it could also be seen as retaliation for our coverage. I have emailed @PressSec https:  .      Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 9, 2017,  Trump has referred to outlets like CNN and the Times as part of the opposition party and slammed them for publishing fake news based on anonymous sources. The New York Times was sent to the very last row a day after former FBI director James Comey revealed on Thursday while testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the Times published a fake news story in February suggesting that Trumps campaign had colluded with Russians a year before the 2016 election. The White House has put the New York Times in the last row at todays joint press conference with Trump and Romanias president pic. twitter.      Gabby Morrongiello (@gabriellahope_) June 9, 2017,  In the main, it was not true, Comey said of the story, which was based on four anonymous sources. And again, all of you know this. Maybe the American people dont. The challenge, and Im not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information, is the people talking about it often dont really know whats going on, and going on are not talking about it. We dont call the press to say, hey, you dont that thing wrong about the sensitive topic. We have to leave it there.  In addition to the Times fake news story, Comey also revealed that have been many, many stories in the mainstream press about the Trump campaign and Russia that have been dead wrong."
"Hezbollah-Tied Men Busted for Plot to Attack in New York, Panama",Breitbart,Breitbart Jerusalem,6/9/2017,"NEW YORK (AP)     Two men from Michigan and New York City were tasked by a terrorist organization with looking for potential terrorism targets in New York and Panama, U. S. authorities said Thursday as they announced the suspects recent arrests. [Samer El Debek, 37, of Dearborn, Michigan, and Ali Kourani, 32, of the Bronx, were charged in Manhattan federal court with providing support to a terrorist organization. El Debek was arrested June 1 in Livonia, Michigan Kourani was arrested the same day in the Bronx. Both men were being held in New York City after court appearances.  Defense lawyers did not immediately comment. In a release, authorities said the men tried to provide support to Hezbollahs Islamic Jihad organization after receiving military training from the group. They said El Debek looked for potential targets in Panama, including U. S. and Israeli embassies, and ships in the Panama Canal, while Kourani surveilled American targets, including military and law enforcement facilities in New York City. William F. Sweeney Jr. head of the New York FBI office, said the charges reveal once again that the New York City region remains a focus of many adversaries, demonstrated as alleged in this instance by followers of a sophisticated and determined organization with a long history of coordinating violent activities on behalf of Hezbollah.  New York Police Commissioner James P. ONeill said Kourani and others conducted covert surveillance of potential targets, including U. S. military bases and Israeli military personnel in New York City. ONeill noted that Kourani, who was born in Lebanon, received sophisticated military training overseas on at least two occasions, including the use of a rocket propelled grenade. He said El Debek also was charged with possessing extensive   training from Hezbollah. Authorities said Kourani attended   weapons training in Lebanon in 2000 when he was 16. They said he lawfully entered the U. S. in 2003, obtaining a Bachelor of Science degree in biomedical engineering in 2009 and a masters in business administration in 2013. Authorities said El Debek, a naturalized U. S. citizen, was first recruited by Hezbollah in late 2007 or early 2008. They said he received military training from the group from 2008 through 2014."

EXCLUSIVE  John Bolton: Travesty that Russia Collusion Conspiracy Is Being Dragged Out,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/9/2017,"NEW YORK     There has been no evidence presented indicating any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia to usurp the 2016 presidential election and it is just a travesty that this is being dragged out, exclaimed John Bolton, former U. S. ambassador to the United Nations. [You know, weve seen Washington in the past year awash about leaks about Trump, his campaign, his presidency, stated Bolton. I would think if there was any real evidence that would have leaked out. That would have been too good for somebody to withhold. It hasnt happened yet.   I think its just a travesty that this is being dragged out. I dont have any doubt that Russia tried to interfere in the election because I think it wants to reduce American faith in their institutions.  But as for the specific picture that the presidents opponents are trying to paint, they are painting without colors at this point.  Speaking to this reporter, Bolton continued: Ive read the book shattered about Hillary Clintons campaign. I was fascinated to read that in the days after her defeat unable to come up with an explanation as to why she had lost      like maybe she was not a very good candidate who didnt have appealing policies for the American people     her campaign staff decided that it was the Russians that had caused them the election. Now since then, Hillary Clinton has had her own long list of excuses why she didnt win, but certainly that germinated the idea of the Russian collusion, the Russian connection. And there has not been any evidence. Bolton was referring to the book Shattered: Inside Hillary Clintons Doomed Campaign, in which authors  Jonathan Allen and Amie Parnes quote Clinton insiders explaining how immediately after the election Clintons team sought to place the blame for her loss on the narrative of Russian interference. She wants to make sure all these narratives get spun the right way, one longtime Clinton confidant was quoted in the book as saying. According to the book, within   hours after Clinton conceded, senior campaign staffers John Podesta and Robby Mook hatched the plan to blame alleged Russian hacking as well as the news medias focus on the failed candidates private email server.

Jeremy Corbyn is having the best night ever,CNN,Eliza Mackintosh,6/9/2017,"London (CNN) UK Opposition Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn is having the best night ever. In the early hours of Friday morning, Corbyn left his modest home in north London like a rockstar    to cheers and the bright lights of camera flashes. After early results in the UK general election showed his party far outperforming expectations, Corbyn tweeted his thanks to everyone who voted for our manifesto and its radical vision for a fairer Britain. Whatever the final result, our positive campaign has changed politics for the better, Corbyn added. No matter how the results shake out, Corbyn, who was repeatedly mocked throughout his campaign, particularly by the rightwing UK press, had a lot to celebrate. And so did his supporters. Many took to social media with the hashtag #CansForCorbyn, sharing pictures as they cracked open beers to celebrate the shock exit poll. In one pub, chants of Jez we can! Jez we can! could be heard from Corbyns fanatical supporters, who refer to him lovingly as Jezza. People leaving a Gorillaz gig at south Londons Brixton Academy broke out into spontaneous cheers of oh Jeremy Corbyn just after polls closed. The chant, set to the tune of the White Stripes Seven Nation Army, has become a favorite of his base. Many on social media joked that Corbyn was actually having the breast night of his life, after a high five that went wrong with Labours Emily Thornberry. But that didnt seem to dampen his spirits. He beamed as he addressed his constituency of Islington North, calling for Prime Minister Theresa May to step down. Corbyn told supporters that May had lost her mandate and it was time to go and make way for a government which is truly representative. And the bookies agreed    Corbyn surged past May as favorite to become next prime minister, according to gambling firms Ladbrokes, Paddy Power, and Betfair Exchange."
Pound Falls Three Cents on the Dollar in Wake of General Election Uncertainty,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/9/2017,"LONDON (AP)     The pound fell sharply after Britains election saw the Conservatives lose their majority in parliament, raising questions about the next governments ability to lead the talks to leave the European Union. [The British currency lost as much as 3 cents against the dollar by Friday as the results confirmed exit poll predictions that Prime Minister Theresa May had failed in her gambit to gain a stronger majority for those Brexit talks.  The pound fell as low as $1. 2636 from $1. 2955 on Thursday, before recovering slightly to trade at $1. 2737. Above all, investors are worried about the general uncertainty surrounding the country     whether a bruised May will resign in due course, whether the Conservatives will be able to form a new government or whether it will be an alliance of opposition parties, led by the Labour Party. The big picture is that political uncertainty could take weeks or months to be resolved and it is likely to weigh on both financial markets (in particular the pound) and the economy, said Paul Hollingsworth, economist at Capital Economics in London. As the dust settles, one issue will dominate investors concerns above all: whether Britain is more or less likely to retain privileged access to the EUs single market, the destination for most of the countrys exports. Currently, investors seem to worry that a weakened Conservative prime minister would not have the power to resist calls from some within the party who want a clean divorce from the EU, even if that means losing privileged access to the EU single market. When May called the election in April, she did so with the Conservatives riding high in the polls, and the pound had surged on expectations that a big majority for the Conservatives would allow her to quell the   eurosceptics in her parliamentary ranks. But her decision to call the general election has backfired, and it is not even certain she will remain at the helm. Samuel Tombs, analyst at Pantheon Macroeconomics, says the pound could drop further, to $1. 2600, where it was trading before May announced the election in April. Complicating the outlook for the pound, however, is the strong showing by the Labour Party, which has advocated for closer ties between Britain and the EU single market. Though Labour is not expected to form the next government, even through an alliance with smaller parties, the vote suggests the British warmed to the partys vision of keeping close ties with the lucrative EU market. The drop in the pound could push up inflation further in Britain, eroding peoples living standards. It would make British exports more price competitive around the world     something that was reflected in a rise in shares for major British companies on Friday, with the FTSE 100 index was up 0. 6 percent. It would also in theory make it cheaper for foreign people and companies to spend and invest in Britain, though analysts say any gains would likely be offset by the chilling effect the general uncertainty will have on business investment. This is a serious moment for the U. K. economy, said Carolyn Fairbairn, the head of Britains biggest business lobby, the CBI. Politicians must act responsibly, putting the interests of the country first and showing the world that the U. K. remains a safe destination for business."
What will happen if there is a hung parliament?,Business Insider,Adam Payne,6/9/2017,"LONDON     Britain is heading for a hung parliament as a result of   Theresa Mays Conservatives losing a signficant number of seats,   according to a stunning exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky.     The exit poll predicts the Tories will be 12 seats short of a   parliamentary majority.      Here are the full results of the exit poll:     If accurate, it would mean one of the most remarkable election   results in British history.     But what actually is a hung parliament? And what would it   actually mean in practice?     Heres everything you need to know.     In most previous British general elections one party has won an   absolute majority in Parliament.     This is when one party wins more seats than all the other parties   put together. Technically speaking, a party must win 326 of the   650 seats in the House of Commons in order to win an absolute   majority.     However, in reality the winning threshold is 323, as MPs from   Northern Irish party Sinn Fein dont attend parliament, .     The First Past the Post voting system is designed to make this   outcome more likely by translating smaller national leads in   percentage terms, into bigger leads in terms of seats.     On rare occasions, the winning party does not gain enough seats   to form an absolute majority, i. e. it has won fewer seats than   all the other parties put together. This is a hung parliament.     Britain has experienced just six hung parliaments since the   beginning of the 20th century. The most recent occurred in 2010   when David Camerons Conservatives won the election but with not   enough seats to form an absolute majority.     Hung parliaments make passing legislation very difficult for the   party in government. This is because, in theory, all other   parties in the Commons can team up to defeat the government on   laws it wants to pass.     This leaves the governing party with the following options:     Cameron went with the second option in 2010. He persuaded the   Liberal Democrats, then led by Nick Clegg, to join the   Conservatives in a formal coalition, and give the Tories the   numbers they needed to form an absolute majority.        If the election produces a hung parliament then May will likely   have to go down the route of her predecessor Cameron and try to   form a formal coalition government.     In theory, this could involve trying to strike a deal with the   Liberal Democrats, assuming Tim Farrons party wins enough seats,   or perhaps even the SNP, although the Tories and the SNP disagree   on just about everything, not least Brexit and the question of   Scottish independence. It may even mean May having to stitch   together the support of several smaller parties in order to   govern, the possibility of which she has previously dubbed a   coalition of chaos.        Its unlikely that May would try to go it alone as a minority   government, given that many of her policies     the reintroduction   of grammar schools, for example     face fierce opposition from MPs   both from other parties and her own.     If May were to fail to form a coalition and didnt want to go it   alone, then the only remaining option would be to hold   another general election that would take place a few   months down the line.     This situation happened in 1974, when a minority Labour   government was elected in February of that year. Labour had   the most seats but had taken fewer actual votes than the   Conservatives. Prime Minister Harold Wilson called another   general election in October 1974, and Labour won a     majority. That government survived until 1979 but it was   incredibly unstable.   eliminated Labours majority,   and a pact with the former Liberal Party in 1977 eventually   collapsed, leading to the 1979 election.     Today, a second election in the space of a few months would   also be Britains third election in just three years.     Its hard to imagine the public being enthused about yet another   campaign, and the history of such second elections suggests that   it would likely lead to a very similar result to the first.     The time required to both campaign for and hold a second general   election would also eat up months of time that was supposed to be   used for Brexit negotiations with the European Union.     A hung parliament could spell total chaos.   LONDON     Britain is heading for a hung. .."

Underestimated by moderates in the Labour party   who     twice     refused to believe he could lead and win.   Underestimated by the opinion pollsters who routinely put him 20   points or more behind Theresa Mays Conservatives. And   underestimated by the traditional media who simply assumed he was   this centurys Michael Foot (the Labour leader in the 1980s who   led the party to one of its worst results).     Behind all that, Corbyns machine went direct to its core   constituency: Young people and former Labour voters who were   alienated by Tony Blair. He went direct to them on Facebook and   Twitter, gathering audiences that vastly exceed those who watch   the BBC or read the Daily Mail. The turnout in this election has   been a huge factor in Corbyns favour: It looks as if the young   have come out to vote in unexpected numbers.     And it has all paid off. Corbyn has rallied his supporters and   confounded his critics. He wont be dismissed quite so easily   from now on.   0135     CONSERVATIVES TAKE ANOTHER SEAT     Tories add another seat to reach 11, while Labour leads with 23.     : Harlow:Con: 54. 0% (+5. 2) Lab: 38. 4% (+8. 4) UKIP: 4. 0% ( . 3) LDem: 2. 2% (+0. 1) Grn: 1. 5% ( . 7) Con majority down. ..tt  0131     DEPUTY LABOUR LEADER TOM WATSON HOLDS HIS   SEAT     He holds West Bromich East.

An alternative exit poll published by NME suggests that a   massive 60% of young people in Britain voted for Jeremy Corbyns   Labour Party. Turnout among young people, meanwhile, is up 12% to   56% on the last general election in 2015.     The NME exit poll was conducted by The Stream and surveyed 1, 354      .      2255     THIS IS WHAT A HUNG PARLIAMENT WILL MEAN FOR   BRITAIN        Britain is heading for a hung parliament as a result of Theresa   Mays Conservatives losing a significant number of seats,   according to a stunning exit poll for the BBC, ITV and Sky.     The exit poll predicts the Tories will be 12 seats short of a   parliamentary majority.      BIs politics reporter Adam Payne put together an explainer about   what a hung parliament would mean for Britain.    2250     LABOURS JOHN MCDONNELL SAYS MAY SHOULD CONSIDER   RESIGNING IF THERES A HUNG PARLIAMENT     John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, told the BBC that if the   exit poll is right, the current Prime Minister Theresa May should   consider resigning:         If it is right, then I think her position is becoming       increasingly untenable. I tell you why     if you listen to       what people are saying, Theresa May promised on seven       different occasions that she wouldnt go for a snap general       election.             And she went for it on the basis that she wanted to secure a       mandate that she already had. People just saw through that.       They saw this as an election which was for party advantage       rather than the interests of the country. And it looks as       though theyve rejected her as a result.       2235     BETTING MARKETS SLASH TORY MAJORITY ODDS  the latest prices, with    are:   2222     HERE ARE ALL THE KEY SEAT RESULTS TO STAY UP   FOR     BIs politics editor Adam Bienkov has put together a guide of all   the seats to watch out for when results roll in.     For example, Sunderland Central is one of them:     One of the first seats to declare will be Sunderland Central   in North East England. The seat has been held by Labour since its   current boundaries were formed in 2010 and should be the easiest   of holds for Jeremy Corbyns party. However, if Theresa May is on   course for the sort of new   landslide that some polls   at the start of the general election predicted then Sunderland   Central will be our first indication. Even a   close result here would spell major trouble for Labour   nationally.      2215     BRITAINS DEFENCE SECRETARY SAYS EXIT POLLS HAVE   BEEN WRONG IN THE PAST     Defence Secretary Michael Fallon tells the BBC: Lets see some   actual results. These exit polls have been wrong in the past. In   2015 they underestimated our vote, a couple of elections before   that they overestimated our vote.     Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell on the Tory campaign added: It   was pretty nasty, it was very nasty. It dragged us into the   gutter at times. Lets put that to one side. If the result is   anywhere near like this, it means that positive politics has   actually succeeded.   2207     HERE ARE THE FULL EXIT POLL NUMBERS     tttOfficial 2017 Exit poll:Conservatives: 314Labour: 266Lib Dems: 34SNP:14UKIP: 0No majority.          2203     POUND PLUNGES     BIs markets reporter Will Martin writes:      2200     EXIT POLLS ARE IN     And it looks like its going to be a hung parliament.   2155     RESULTS COULD BE IN EARLIER THAN EXPECTED     Usually, during a general election, which is meant to be once   every five years, there are local elections too.     However since this is a snap general election, there are no local   elections taking place and therefore results might come in   earlier than usual.

Europe Reacts to General Election Results: Mays No Margaret Thatcher,Breitbart,Donna Rachel Edmunds,6/9/2017,"Leaders across Europe have been reacting to the news that the Conservatives have lost their majority, pitching the country back into hung Parliament territory. [Unsurprisingly the main concern on the continent is how the result will impact Brexit. With negotiations due to begin in just under two weeks, EU leaders have been urging the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, to get her house in order as fast as possible.  We dont know when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Do your best to avoid a no deal as result of no negotiations. #GE2017,     Donald Tusk (@eucopresident) June 9, 2017,  President of the European Council Donald Tusk urged the British to do your best to avoid no deal a theme he followed up in a letter of congratulations to Theresa May. Our shared responsibility and urgent task now is to conduct the negotiations on the UKs withdrawal from the European Union in the best possible spirit, securing the least disruptive outcome for our citizens, businesses and countries after March 2019, he wrote, adding: The timeframe set by Article 50 of the Treaty leaves us with no time to lose.  The EUs chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier also urged the moving forward of Brexit talks, albeit with less haste. #Brexit negotiations should start when UK is ready timetable and EU positions are clear. Lets put our minds together on striking a deal,     Michel Barnier (@MichelBarnier) June 9, 2017,  EU Commission President   Juncker meanwhile merely urged Britain to form a government as soon as possible. As far as the Commission is concerned we can open negotiations tomorrow morning at half past nine, he said, according to the BBC. First we have to agree on the divorce and exit modalities, and then we have to envisage the architecture of our future relations. I do hope that the result of the elections will have no major impact on the negotiations we are desperately waiting for.  Guy Verhofstadt, President of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe and a member of the EUs Brexit negotiating team, made no secret of his hopes ahead of the election, tweeting a picture of EU and British unity. Hopefully, the British are voting with this picture in mind :) pic. twitter.      Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt) June 8, 2017,  As the results came in he did not hold back, calling the outcome an own goal for the Conservatives. Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated.     Guy Verhofstadt (@GuyVerhofstadt) June 9, 2017,  German politicians meanwhile were bullish, clearly viewing the result as a victory for the EUs negotiating team.  Elmar Brok, Brexit representative for Angela Merkels CDU Party in the European Parliament predicted Mays resignation, saying: Theresa Mays authority in her own party is broken. She has become a weak prime minister and negotiator. It is quite possible she will go.  Jens Geier of the rival SPD was similarly scathing. She missed her target of an absolute majority, he said. The Prime Minister hasnt got the support for a strengthened negotiating position with the rest of the EU member states.  Martin Schulz, who is running against Merkel in the upcoming German elections meanwhile confirmed he had gone a step further and had reached out to Mays rival, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. What a race! Congratulations to @jeremycorbyn and @UKLabour!     Martin Schulz (@MartinSchulz) June 9, 2017,  Just talked to Jeremy Corbyn on the phone. We agreed to meet very soon.     Martin Schulz (@MartinSchulz) June 9, 2017,  Jaroslaw Gowin, deputy prime minister in Polands conservative government was less thrilled, describing the results as a bad sign for Europe which deepened the uncertainties over the future of Europe, the Telegraph has reported. Further afield, Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the foreign affairs committee in Russias upper house quipped that Theresa May had stepped on Camerons rake and had scored the home goal of the season. What happens next is far less predictable, Mr Kosachev said via Facebook, but in any case, the next government wont have guaranteed support in parliament and the efficiency of its work will decrease. Equally predictable is a period of instability and a decline of British authority in international affairs.  The Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera meanwhile was decisive in its verdict, proclaiming: Theresas gamble failed, she is no Margaret Thatcher."
Valerie Jarrett: Trump Abdicated U.S. Role as Beacon of Hope With Paris Accord Exit - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/9/2017,"Last week in Washington D. C. at a discussion sponsored by the Raben Group, former senior advisor to President Barack Obama Valerie Jarrett spoke about President Donald Trumps decision to withdraw from the Paris climate accord.  She said that decision meant he was abdicating Americas role as both a beacon of hope and the leader of the world. Jarrett said, It is unrefuted science that there are   consequences that are leading to the degradation of our planet. And it was unprecedented to have so many countries, nearly 200 countries from around the world, who followed the United States lead on this issue and came to the table and not just the government leaders but in our country, just hundreds and hundreds of large corporations signed on recognizing that it is not   to care about our climate it is not an either or, it is a both and an imperative.  She continued, So I think it signals to the world that the United States is not serious about protecting our planet. Now, I dont know what other way to interpret a decision that I think could be as dramatically negatively impactful as that decision. And what it means is the rest of the world will move forward without us and the United States has always been that beacon of hope, the leader, the world leader, thats why were called the world leader and were basically abdicating that role, so thats disappointing to me.

"Bill Maher Apologizes for N-word Use, Gets Lecture From Michael Eric Dyson - Breitbart",Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/9/2017,"Last week during his HBO Real Time broadcast, host Bill Maher sparked a controversy with his use of the   during an interview with Sen. Ben Sasse ( ). On this weeks broadcast, Maher apologized for it and explained it why apologizing was appropriate to his audience and Georgetown sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson.  I thought you were going to be easy on me and you shouldnt, Maher said. But you know, honestly, Ive said both. I mean, I remember when Mitt Romney was running hes had a book, No Apologies. You know, like America should never apologize. No, apologies are sometimes appropriate. There is a lot of bullshit apologizing in America, and I am against that.

The Yoof What Swung It? 72 Per Cent of Young People Vote,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,6/9/2017,"Labour won a strong majority of the seats where turnout increased by more than 5 per cent, with roughly 70 per cent of 18        voting nationwide, according to early estimates. [Thursday night, for the fist time in decades, younger voters appear to have been overrepresented in contrast with previous elections, with turnout rising to its highest level in 20 years.  The overall turnout is estimated to be 68. 7 per cent     up 2. 6 per cent on 2015. The youth turnout, meanwhile, was around three points higher than the overall     up around 27 per cent on 2015 to approximately 70 per cent, the Metro and others report. In the last four general elections     2001, 2005, 2010, and 2015     apathy was commonplace and youth turnout hovered around 40 per cent. In the last general election, a year and a half ago, just 43 per cent of 18 to 24s voted. In the European Union (EU) referendum, turnout amongst this group rose to just 64 per cent. Since 1997, the average turnout amongst young people has been consistently lower than the overall turnout. The overall turnout was 72 per cent for the Brexit vote and 66 per cent in the 2015 general election. A high turnout seems to have benefited Labour more than any other party, with an analysis by Sky News showing the vast majority of seats where it leapt by more than 5 per cent going to Labour. Record numbers of people signed up to vote on deadline day before registrations closed, with more than 600, 000 names added to the electoral roll in the final 24 hours. Labour, and in particular Jeremy Corbyns activist faction of the party, Momentum, were notably adept at winning celebrity endorsements and utilising social media to reach out to young voters and getting them to register. Countless musicians, rappers, actors, and reality TV stars endorsed the hard left candidate. There was even a Grime for Corbyn movement, with UK rappers almost unanimously backing, and campaigning for, Labour. The music press was also united behind labour, with Mr. Corbyn featuring on the front covers of NME (an Indy rock publication) and Kerrang (a heavy metal publication). Funniest part for the Tories is that rappers actually influenced the outcome  NO ONE can deny this! @JmeBBK @Stormzy1 @Novelist  Lowkey,     Akala (@akalamusic) June 9, 2017,  Early reports suggest that 72% of   voted.

Kris Kobach Enters Kansas Governor Race to End Insane Policies like Charging American Students Three Times as Much as Illegals,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/9/2017,"Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach discussed his gubernatorial campaign with SiriusXM host Matt Boyle on Fridays Breitbart News Daily. [Kobach said taxation would be a core issue in his campaign.  LISTEN: Some people may know Kansas. We did cut our income taxes quite a bit and reduced to zero the taxes on LLCs and S corporations a few years ago, he said. But a coalition of Democrats and liberal Republicans in the legislature just raised those taxes back up, doing so on the theory that they had to, to balance the budget.  I think that Kansas doesnt have a revenue problem. It has a spending problem. We should have been cutting the budget, he contended. On immigration, Kobach said Kansas is a fairly conservative state, but our legislature hasnt been conservative, and weve kind of become the sanctuary state of the Midwest.  Were not formally a sanctuary state, but we do nothing to discourage illegal immigration, he elaborated. We give aliens   tuition. I want to stop that.  Kobach noted Kansas is one of the very few states west of the Mississippi that does not have term limits, which he saw as vital to fighting corruption. As a result, our legislators, some of them form entire careers in the state legislature. Id like to see us have term limits for the legislature, as well as for the entire list of statewide offices, he said. Kobach wryly conceded, The left is not excited that Im running when Boyle noted the panoply of   groups denouncing his candidacy for governor. Boyle noted the left was fearful that Kobach really would put a stop to unbelievable policies like giving discounted   tuition rates to illegal immigrants. Its insane, Kobach agreed. I mean, think about it: Youve got someone who lives in a neighboring state, say Missouri. A kid grows up there, wants to go to Kansas University or Kansas State, pays three times as much in tuition as an illegal alien. It makes no sense whatsoever. Its against federal law. Congress was trying to stop this way back in the nineties they passed a law saying no state could do it, but several states did anyway.  Were going to try to stop that. I think you just need a governor who will come in and say, Look, Im not budging. Were going to do it, and were going to do it now, or were going to do it later, but were going to do it while Im governor, he said, promising to draw some lines in the sand and not let anyone cross them.  Kobach laid out three major points in his   agenda. One I already mentioned was term limits. Try to push term limits through. Now, thats going to be a heavy lift since we dont have the popular initiative. Were going to have to push it through the legislature, and you know most politicians dont like limiting their own terms in legislatures, he said. Second is pass a statute stopping the revolving door, he continued. Right now in Kansas, you can retire from the legislature, and then the next day, you can start lobbying your former colleagues. Well put time limits on how soon you can become a lobbyist in Kansas. You can become a lobbyist somewhere else if you want, but not in Kansas.  Kobach said his third goal would be to achieve political transparency by replacing Republicans in Name Only who tend to side with Democrats. We really have this problem very badly in Kansas, he explained. If you look at the numbers, our legislature in the Senate is 32 to 8     32 Republicans to 8 Democrats. Similar lopsided numbers in the House, over a   majority Republican. But many of those Republicans are truly RINOs     Republicans in Name Only. They vote with the Democrats all the time. When they go home, they talk like Republicans. They might even use the word conservative to describe themselves. But then, they come in and become a completely different person when they are in the state legislature.  One of the things the governor has to do is actually call people out by name and say, Look, I need this persons vote and try to get the public aware of who these people are who are breaching the public trust, said Kobach.  If their district wants to elect someone who is liberal and votes with the Democrats, so be it. But there is a real deception going on. You see it in states like Kansas, where there are districts across the western part of our state which will not elect a Democrat, period. So what the Democrats do is, they just run as Republicans, he said. Kobach agreed with Boyle that voters are tired of politicians who say one thing and do another. I think theyre also tired of the politician who talks like everything he says is carefully polished and has gone through three focus groups, Kobach added. The thing that people loved about Trump is that hes speaking from the gut. They could tell that this is what the guy really thinks. His speech wasnt prepared and screened and reviewed by others, a bunch of     baloney, but is actually a guy telling us what he thinks. I think thats important.  Nobody can do it like President Trump does it, but thats kind of the way I have spoken to my constituents as secretary of state: Here, this is what Im going to do. Im not going to beat around the bush. If you dont like it, dont vote for me, he said. Breitbart News Daily airs on SiriusXM Patriot 125 weekdays from 6:00 a. m. to 9:00 a. m. Eastern.

Baghdad Pans Kurdish Freedom Referendum as U.S. Warns Against Islamic State Distractions - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/9/2017,"Iraqi Prime Minister Haider   issued a statement Friday rejecting the call by Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Masoud Barzani for a national independence referendum, declaring that the Kurdish people cannot decide its fate unilaterally. [Iraqi News carried the statement by   which followed Barzanis declaration that the Kurds would hold a referendum vote in September.  Iraqi relies on the constitution as the reference for shaping the relation between the federal government and Kurdistan region, the statement, issued by spokesman Saad   read. No party can decide its fate unilaterally.        All Iraqis should have their say regarding their homelands fate.  A number of interested government parties have weighed in on the announcement, including the governments of Turkey, Germany, and the United States. The U. S. State Department issued its remarks on the matter on Thursday, warning against the referendum taking place before the ultimate defeat of the Islamic State in Iraq. A coalition including Kurdish Peshmerga forces,   Iraqi Shiite militias, and the Iraqi military are currently fighting to eradicate the Islamic State completely from its final major stronghold in the country of Mosul. We support a unified, stable and a federal Iraq. We appreciate and understand the legitimate aspirations of the people of the Iraqi Kurdistan, State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said. We        encourage the regional authorities to engage with the government of Iraq on the full range of important issues, including the future of relations between Baghdad and Erbil, on the bases of the Iraqi constitution.  Nauert added concern that the referendum could damage efforts to address more urgent priorities than a free Kurdistan, including the fight against the Islamic State. American officials have long expressed a belief that Kurdistan would become an independent state in the near future, however. Kurdish independence is on a trajectory where it is probably not if, but when, Marine Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the head of Pentagon intelligence, told the Senate Armed Services Committee last month. And it will complicate the situation unless theres an agreement in Baghdad   an agreement that all of the parties can live with.  The KRG, based in Erbil, cooperates with the United States on   activities and maintains friendly relations with neighbors like Turkey, currently embroiled in a regional conflict with two other Kurdish entities, the Syrian Kurdish Peoples Protection Units (YPG) and the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK). The KRG has repeatedly demanded that both the YPG and PKK stay out of KRG territory. The Turkish government has, nonetheless, loudly opposed the KRG independence referendum, with officials calling the vote a grave mistake.  Prime Minister Binali Yldrm personally referred to the vote as irresponsible.  The Kurdish outlet Rudaw quotes a Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) member saying that Turkish officials also privately threatened Iraqi Kurds who sought to organize the referendum. Barzani announced through a Twitter statement on Wednesday that the referendum would take place on September 25. The presidential office also released an official announcement confirming that the KRG leadership had decided that the date for the independence referendum shall be Monday, September 25, 2017. It will be on that day when the people of the Kurdistan Region, as well as those living in the disputed areas, will cast their votes on whether they accept independence for the Kurdistan.  The announcement triggered mass exclamations of support from Kurds on social media, according to Kurdistan24, which notes that Kurds are believed to be the largest stateless nation in the world, estimated to be over 40 million.  Many added the Kurdish flag to their profile photos and expressed support for Barzani. Opinion polls among Kurds also corroborate the strong support for independence that appeared online. We crossed the Rubicon with that decision, there is no going back, KRG senior adviser Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters Thursday. A referendum is a democratic process, no democratic country can oppose having a referendum we are not talking about independence, we are talking about the referendum.  The Kurdish outlet BasNews reports that   Arab Iraqis also appear supportive of the move, with a Turkmen political leader expressing support for the significant measure, and a Yazidi leader stating, Kurdish Yezidis support referendum and independence of Kurdistan Region.

Jackie Mason: Comey Hearing Like a Funeral Where Everybodys Enjoying Themselves (Exclusive),Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/9/2017,"In these trying times, Jackie Mason is the Voice of Reason. [In this weeks exclusive clip for Breitbart News, Jackie ponders Thursdays big Senate hearing starring former FBI director James Comey.  Everybody covered it. Every station everywhere in the world, whether it was on television, radio, people without a station, anywhere you went, they covered it, Jackie said. Except for the cartoon channel. And theyre the only ones who should have covered it, because lets be honest, this was the biggest joke you ever saw in your life.  Jackie says we really only learned two things from the Comey hearing the first is that Comey is either the most hated or the most beloved man in the country, depending on ones political affiliation. And the second is that the American people can completely trust Comey       except as head of the FBI.  Jackie also wondered why the senators at Thursdays hearing were smiling and laughing and appeared to be enjoying themselves if Comeys testimony was as dire and as serious and as   as it was supposed to be. They dont really care what the consequences are, they dont care what the purpose is. All they know is, this is a phenomenal thing, he says. Did you watch this on television yesterday? It looked like a party, it looked like a dance, like a bar mitzvah. You would think this was the happiest day in the world. You would never know this is a serious problem that has such dire, terrible consequences and possibilities.  The whole world might come to an end on Thursday. Except for the fact that theyre having the best time of their lives, Jackie continued. You ever go to a funeral where everybodys enjoying themselves? You ever go to any kind of situation where a person might pass away in an hour, and everybody is dancing and singing and taking pictures and flying around for cameras and having the best time of their lives? These politicians are all the same, he concludes. They dont care what really happens. Nothing bothers them and nothing makes any difference to them. They only care that they have a chance to be on television, they could make a party out of it and everybody can see them.  Watch Jackies latest above.

Why is Donald Trump so eager to protect Mike Flynn?,Business Insider,Josh Barro,6/9/2017,"In his testimony on Thursday, James Comey, the fired FBI   director, made clear that President Donald Trump did not ask him   to close the broad Russia inquiry. Rather, when Trump asked Comey   to let this go, Trump was referring specifically to the   ancillary criminal investigation into whether former national   security adviser Michael Flynn lied to FBI investigators.     So Sen. Angus King asked Comey whether  would have interfered with the broader   Russia investigation.     No, Comey said. Then he paused to think, and said it was   unlikely. And then he described how halting the criminal   inquiry into Flynn could possibly interfere with the   broader counterintelligence investigation.     There is always a possibility if you have a criminal case   against someone and you bring it and squeeze them, you flip them,   and they give you information about something else, Comey said.     Trump talks a lot about loyalty, but loyalty for him is usually   a   street: Others are supposed to be loyal to him. Comey   even said Trump  if the Russia investigation flushed out untoward   activity by other campaign satellites of his.      But when it came to Flynn, Trump leaned on Comey to back off.   With Flynn, Trumps loyalty is a   street. Why? Is it that   he has special personal affection for Flynn? Or is it because he   is afraid of what Flynn might tell prosecutors to get out from   under a criminal investigation?     I am not positing that Trump and Flynn engaged in a treasonous,   quid pro quo scheme with the Russians. That seems too   complicated, and there are simpler explanations for Trumps     behavior and Russias   behavior.     But I am positing that Trump is a person with no ethical   standards who openly describes himself as greedy, and that   Flynn is a person who has shown a willingness to  from hostile and   foreign powers and   then act in his official capacities to benefit those foreign   powers. And I am positing that Trump and Flynn tended to get up   to no good together.     Who knows what unknown unknowns are out there     and what Trump   and his buddy Flynn could have gotten up to.     In any complex investigation, when you start turning over rocks,   sometimes you find things that are unrelated to the primary   investigation that are criminal in nature, Comey said on   Thursday.     There are certain rocks that Trump seems to have really not   wanted turned over     rocks he told the FBI director he hoped he   would not turn over, and rocks over which he seems to have fired   the FBI director out of his frustration that they might be turned   over.     I would like to know whats under those rocks.  In his testimony on Thursday, James Comey, the. .."
Freedom Caucus Chair Mark Meadows: We Need Tax Reform By August,Breitbart,Sean Moran,6/9/2017,"House Freedom Caucus chair Mark Meadows ( ) says that if Congress fails to introduce a tax reform package by the end of July, leadership in the House and Senate should call off the August recess. [Chairman Meadows told attendees at a Heritage Foundation tax event, We need to get tax reform done sooner (rather) than later and by that we should have a real proposal that we start debating before we leave at the end of July.   Meadows said that we need to have an agreement on tax reform in the next 3 or 4 weeks and that negotiations will fare much better once Congress moves past the idea of a border adjustment tax. There is no consensus for the border adjustment tax. The sooner we acknowledge that and get on with a plan that actually works and actually can build consensus, the better off we will be, the North Carolina congressman added. Meadows negotiated with former Tuesday   Tom MacArthur ( ) to craft the MacArthur amendment. The amendment galvanized enough support for the American Health Care Act (AHCA) to pass through the House. Now, Meadows wants to negotiate a tax reform deal, even if that means getting rid of Congresss vacation in August. Rep. Jim Jordan ( ) the former Freedom Caucus chair, also dispelled the notion of a border adjustment tax. A border adjustment tax (BAT) would tax imports at 20 percent while exempting exports from the tax. Jordan said that lawmakers need to eliminate the idea of revenue neutrality for tax reform, which he argues does not amount to a real tax cut for Americans. Letting families keep more of their money is not a cost to government   its called freedom, Jordan said. The Ohio congressman chided the current talks of the House budget negotiations. Jordan said, Right now a budget cannot pass in the House.  Congressman Dave Brat ( ) explained that this is a one in a century opportunity to create economic growth through tax reform. Jack Spencer, the vice president for the Institute for Economic Freedom at Heritage, asked the Freedom Caucus panel how the Senate might jeopardize the reconciliation and budget process by retaining Obamacares taxes in the Senate health care bill. Jordan chided, It certainly doesnt help it. Thats the Senates job.  Congressman Warren Davidson ( ) another Freedom Caucus member, reiterated Jordans emphasis on real tax cuts for American families. We cant tweak around the edges, we need to go big, Davidson said."
"Pelosi: When Republicans Voted For Trump, It Was Like Any Mammal Will Do - Breitbart",Breitbart,Pam Key,6/9/2017,"Friday on MSNBCs Morning Joe House Minority Leader Rep. Nancy Pelosi ( ) said when Republicans voted for President Donald Trump they were voting a certain way, almost like any mammal will do.   When asked if Trump was a dealmaker, Pelosi said, I will give you this as an example, the first meeting we had, House and Senate, Democrats and Republicans leadership in the White House, this is a big deal. I mean it feels you with some pride to have a seat at the table and a new president, I have been at that meeting with President George W. Bush as a leader and same thing with President Obama, and now here we are with a new president. The first thing he says, You know I won the popular vote. Well, I thought since hes being unconventional so will I. Because I was respectful with President Bush and we worked closely with him     Joe Scarborough interjected, I bet you are missing him now? Pelosi replied, He told me I would. He said, Youre going to miss me. That was a long time ago. I wish he were president now. I wish Mitt Romney were president. I wish John McCain were president. As far as the Republicans, the people that voted, its almost like any mammal will do. They were just voting a certain way.  She continued her story, When he said that, I said, Thats not true, there is no evidence to support what you just said. If we were going to work together, we have to stipulate to a certain set of facts. When we work with President Bush or when we work across the aisle, we all have to start at a place where we are dealing with facts, evidence, and data and you can compromise. You cannot make things up. He said, Well 3 or 4 million people voted illegally. I said, Well, thats not true. And he said and I am not counting California. That was pretty sad because he didnt understand his place in history.  Pelosi also said Trump does not sleep enough, adding, Im concerned about his fitness for office.

Carlson: Trump-Russia Hoax an Effort to Topple a Democratically Elected Government the D.C. Permanent Class Doesnt Like - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/9/2017,"Friday during the opening monologue of Tucker Carlson Tonight, host Tucker Carlson sounded off on the effect of former FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee a day earlier. [Carlson argued Comeys testimony did not further the   conspiracy narrative, which many had hoped would bring the beginning of the end to the Donald Trump presidency.  [H]ere is what is true     as of 8 p. m. Eastern time tonight, Donald Trump is still the president of the U. S. and that means on the most basic level, Comeys testimony failed to achieve its goal. Make no mistake, removing Trump from office was the goal. There was collusion, Russia hacked our election, assault to our democracy, imperils our way of life! You hear those all the time. You hear them every night on this show but nobody in D. C. actually believes any of that, and thats why nobody ever explains how exactly it happened or what specifically the effects of it were. Because they have no idea. And in fact, they dont really care. They just want Trump gone along with anyone who is in the way. Russia is just a means.  Carlson also noted one the latest targets of this effort is Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who is under further scrutiny for having met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak for an undisclosed third time. Nonetheless, the ultimate goal of this hoax according to the Fox News Channel host was to topple a democratically elected government that people in Washington, D. C. did not like. [A]gain, this is not about truth or fairness, much less protecting this country from foreign threats, he added. Its about toppling     lets not lie about it     a democratically elected government that the permanent class in Washington does not like. Now again, collusion with a foreign government against the interest of the United States is tantamount to treason. It is definitely a moral crime, and we would never defend it. We would attack it, of course. There is just no evidence it actually happened. This whole story is a hoax. Its a lie that those who tell it they tell it are beginning to believe. That is the definition of mass hysteria. It is deeply hurting our country, and yet otherwise smart people press forward as if it is all entirely real despite mounting evidence it is not real at all.

Al Gore Says God Told Him to Fight Global Warming,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/9/2017,"Former Vice President Al Gore is now telling his climate disciples that God commands us to go forth and fight global warming. [Engaging in some advanced publicity for his new global warming film spectacular, An Inconvenient Sequel, Gore told Interview Magazine that God didnt create global warming and wants us to fix it.  In his comments, Gore equated the fight against global warming to a   moral crusade similar to the civil rights fight, womens suffrage, and the abolitionist movement during the Civil War era. Gore insisted that it is a moral imperative to fight against climate change. Regarding the climate movement, Gore said warming to his point, there are people who say, God is in complete control of everything that happens, and if the Earth is getting warmer, then maybe God intends that.  Gore then rejected that conceit. Well, no, the     former veep insisted. God intends for us to take responsibility for how we treat Gods creation, and if we choose to use the thin shell of atmosphere surrounding our planet as an open sewer for   tons of   pollution every day, the consequences are attributable to us.  He concluded saying, And if you are a believer, as I am, I think God intends for us to open our eyes and take responsibility for the moral consequences of our actions.  Gores new film is a sequel to his famed An Inconvenient Truth, a shockumentary filled with mistaken assertions and failed predictions. Despite the many inaccuracies of his previous film, in an interview last year Gore still insisted that he underestimated how bad global warming is. I wish the film had   the seriousness of the crisis, but unfortunately it actually underestimated how serious it is, the   Tennessee Senator said.

"Jeb Bush: Trump Didnt Obstruct Justice, But Who Cares What I Think - Breitbart",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/9/2017,"Former Florida Gov. and 2016 presidential candidate Jeb Bush said on Thursday that he doesnt think President Donald Trump obstructed justice. [The charge of obstruction could apply if the President interfered with the FBIs investigation into Russian tampering in the election by firing James Comey as director of the agency in charge of the probe.  No, I dont, but who cares what I think, Bush said when asked whether Trump obstructed justice at a conference at Boston College. There is a process underway and the testimony today is not as relevant to me, in that regard, as Mr. (Special Counsel Robert) Muellers activity.  Bush spoke to a    crowd of finance industry executives and researchers at the 12th Annual Carroll School of Management Finance Conference at Boston College, the Boston Herald reported. His remarks came just minutes before Comey began his testimony about Trump before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  Theres a bar in D. C. thats giving away free beer for every patron     they opened early this morning     for every tweet the president unleashes on Comeys testimony, Bush said, drawing laughter from the audience. Thats a fairly   way to go about things. Its not going to solve the alcoholism problem in our country either, Bush said. The drinkers in D. C. however, as documented by Breitbart News, did not get any free drinks from Trump tweets because the president did not take to Twitter during the hearing. Even after the Comey hearing ended, it was the presidents attorney who made a statement at the National Press Club saying Comeys testimony vindicated the president because the former FBI director confirmed that the president was not under investigation. During his comments and through the    period that followed, the onetime   favorite lamented the lack of compromise and the constant quarreling that has engulfed Washington, the Herald reported. Bush said he cant escape political talk, even when watching ESPN or the Weather Channel.  It would be great to get back to the business of governing and less about the swirling controversies, Bush said. I just think the president needs to focus on doing his job. There are great opportunities for him to hire people, hes done pretty well there, Bush said. The judicial appointments have been good, hes got a great foreign policy team, he should be president and stop creating all the controversies     let that process take its place.  Bush also said he hopes Trump does drain the swamp as president. Drain the swamp was a classic line, it resonated with me, Bush said. I didnt vote for the guy, Im not a big fan and everybody knows that, but I was hopeful that he would drain the swamp and the swamp draining would include lobbying reform      which could be done by executive order if the president really wanted it."
A very damaging day for President Trump: James Comeys blockbuster hearing had something in it for everyone,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/9/2017,"Former FBI Director James Comeys blockbuster Thursday hearing   provided several bruising moments for President Donald   Trump.     Comey, who Trump fired in early May,  because of the Russia investigation, amplifying calls   that Trump was obstructing justice. He said he took Trumps   comments that he hoped  to let go of the investigation into former   national security adviser Michael Flynn as a direction.     Comey said he kept memos on his conversations with the president       a move he said he did not do with two prior presidents or other   top Justice Department officials      was   honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our   meeting.     And he said that, in firing him from the top FBI post, Trump and   his administration tried to defame him by spreading lies,   plain and simple after his departure, citing Trumps shifting   explanations,    included Trump going on TV and saying that he actually fired me   because of the Russia investigation.     Yet among all that, Republicans and supporters of the   president were still able to walk away from Thursdays hearing   with surprising optimism. Trumps allies suggested the testimony   didnt provide a proverbial smoking gun, and they emerged with   options to try to shift the conversation.     Comey, for one, suggested that the Flynn investigation, if   dropped, likely would not alter the course of the FBIs larger   probe into Russias election meddling and the Trump campaigns   role in it. Trumps supporters also took grievance with Comeys   stunning admission that he instructed a good friend          to provide the press with information on his   memos because he felt the investigation may have reached the   point at which a special counsel needed to be appointed.     Perhaps looming largest, though, were  Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the investigation   into Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clintons use of a   private email server. Comey said Lynch asked him to refer to the   email probe as a matter instead of an investigation, which he   said gave him a queasy feeling. It echoed language the Clinton   campaign itself was using.        That was one of the bricks in the load that led me to conclude I   have to step away from the department if were to close this case   credibly, Comey said, adding that consideration of appointing a   special counsel to oversee the matter was a valid suggestion, but   one that would have been unfair. He reiterated that the facts of   the case did not warrant charges pressed against the former   secretary of state.     Fox News host Eric Bolling said on The Specialists     making a   point that many in the Trump realm highlighted in similar ways       Comeys comments on Lynch proved the real collusion.      testimony, Trumps personal attorney Marc   Kasowitz ripped the former FBI director for ordering the leaked   memos. He even suggested that Comey lied under oath,   disputing the claim that Trump hinted that Comey should drop the   Flynn investigation. Of course, he also noted that Comey finally   confirmed publicly what Trump has insisted: that the   president .     Trump personally did not appear to believe Thursday was worth an     fight. Asked about the testimony, Trump declined to   comment, only smiling through pursed lips,    reporter.     There was no knockout punch, Matt Mackowiak, a Republican   strategist and president of the Potomac Strategy Group, told   Business Insider in an email. Trump will benefit from admission   that he was not under investigation and Comeys revelation that   he leaked his own memo to require a special counsel be appointed.   Trump will be harmed [by] inappropriate comments about Flynn made   on the Oval Office, which I do not believe rose to the level of   illegality.     Both sides fight on, he continued.     Matthew Whitaker, a former US attorney, executive director of the   conservative Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust, and   2014 Republican primary candidate in Iowas Senate race, told   Business Insider in an email that Comeys testimony made it   clear that there is absolutely no criminal case to be made   against President Trump for obstruction of justice.     Comeys testimony simply does not come close to proving an   intent to obstruct justice, let alone facts to support a criminal   case, he said. If there is one thing we learned from the   Hillary Clinton email server investigation, it is that the proof   needed for intent at Comeys FBI was set very high.     Whitaker, like many on the right, found the biggest news to be   Comeys revelation about Lynch.     I found it very disturbing to learn that former Attorney General   Loretta Lynch directed then FBI Director Comey to publicly   mischaracterize the probe as just a simple matter, he said.   It just reaffirmed my belief that a special prosecutor should   have been assigned from day one to handle that case.     Jed Shugerman, a Fordham law professor, told Business Insider in   an email that Republicans claims in the aftermath of the Comey   hearing are not good faith arguments based on the testimony. He   called many of them talking points that were     beforehand based on a strategy of isolating the   most favorable facts and events, and ignoring other events and   the big picture.     But, he said, the   side does not have a slam dunk   today, either.     No event in Comeys written testimony     and not even all of   those conversations together     constitutes a clear case of   obstruction, he said. The obstruction case is based on the act   of firing Comey after all of these events and interventions.   Comeys testimony is very helpful for establishing intent to   obstruct and impede, but Trump himself already offered enough   evidence of intent when he connected Comeys firing with his   purpose to impede the Russia investigation.        Shugerman added that Trump defenders argument that Comey   confirmed Trump was not under investigation     prior to Comeys   dismissal     is meaningless.     Its a bit like a thief telling the prosecutor he was not under   investigation for murder, and it turns out he was not under   investigation for murder, he said. Its the confirmation of an   irrelevant fact, and its noise to sound like they are confirming   Trumps story.     For Shugerman, the biggest takeaway from the hearing was how   serious Republicans on the committee were in asking tough, but   fair questions and respectfully giving Comey a full chance to   answer.     By asking good questions, they gave Comey a chance to clarify   the context in very damaging ways, he said, noting exchanges   that involved how Comey felt about Trumps asking if the FBI   director could let go of the Flynn investigation, and about the   exchange Comey and Trump had involving FBI Deputy Director Andrew   McCabe.     The big picture here is that the Republicans are investigating   seriously, not obstructing, he said. None of them were willing   to take on the role of attack dog, unlike the famous example of   Arlen Specter in the Clarence Thomas hearings, or Trey Gowdy in   the Benghazi hearings, or in the   Commission. A   PAC   sent a signal of a strategy to tear at [Comeys] credibility with   ads, but none of the Republican senators followed. Thats very   significant.     Shugerman acknowledged that the Lynch revelation is now a real   subject to investigate further, calling the pressuring of Comey   to use matter instead of investigation a huge mistake and   a partisan intrusion on Lynchs part.     It probably changed history by making Comey more skeptical about   her and the Clintons role, he said. I inferred that it had an   effect on Comey that may have changed how he handled the   investigation later. She will face very tough questions. And it   validates the   questions on the Clinton campaign on   their handling the email.     We will hear a lot about this, he continued. It does not rise   to obstruction, because it was   not the   substance of investigation, but Comey was right to be troubled.   Lynch and [President] Bill Clinton should be called to testify   and explain their behavior. Whats obstruction for the goose is   obstruction for the gander.     Andrew Wright, a law professor at Savannah Law School, told   Business Insider in an email that Comeys direction to leak the   memos, while not criminal or privileged, as Trumps   lawyer argued, does appear retaliatory and gives fodder   to Comeys critics.     But his main takeaways from the hearing did not involve some of   the popular talking points on the right. He focused on how   Comey called Trump and his staff liars, saying that Comey   thought so little of   Trumps first briefing   reaction he started documenting everything and pointing out that   Comey gave a first person account of an obstruction narrative.     He mentioned Comeys referencing of Trump dangling his job   before him, asking for his loyalty, suggesting he drop the Flynn   investigation, and firing him for reasons related to the Russia   investigation. And he said we can infer special counsel Robert   Mueller is investigating Donald Trump for obstruction of   justice based on Comeys testimony.     It was not a tie or pure Rorschach test, it was a very damaging   day for President Trump, he said. There were some kernels for   White House defenders that will help GOP talking points. Also,   there were no the president ordered the Code Red moment. But   the obstruction narrative was enhanced.  James Comeys testimony pulled few punches at. .."
Comeys cryptic answers about the infamous Trump dossier make it look likely it may be verified,Business Insider,Jeremy Berke,6/9/2017,"Former FBI director James Comey may have hinted during his   testimony before the  that some of   the allegations in the    may have been verified.      The dossier, compiled by former MI6 intelligence officer   Christopher Steele, details several allegations of collusion   between the Trump campaign and Russia, among .

Richard Burr, the   Republican chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, whether   the FBI was able to confirm any criminal allegations contained   in the document.     Comey replied that he couldnt answer the question in an open   setting, because it goes into the details of the FBIs   investigation.

"Blue State Blues: South Africas Democratic Experiment, in Crisis - Breitbart",Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/9/2017,"For more than two decades, South Africa has symbolized the hope that the principles of liberty are universal     that the shared values of the free world can transcend divisions of race and culture, and the challenges of economic inequality. [The countrys relatively peaceful transition from apartheid to democracy inspired great expectations for its future. But now South Africa has entered a deep political and economic crisis for which it seems to have no easy answers.  Many South Africans blame the troubled administration of President Jacob Zuma. He took over the ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC) in 2007, and was elected in 2009 atop a populist wave. His supporters expected him to dislodge the countrys establishment     both the old white establishment and the new black elite     and fulfill the redistributionist promises that the party has made to voters since the first fully democratic elections in 1994. But Zuma was dogged by allegations of corruption even then, and those concerns have deepened over the years. First, investigations revealed that the president had spent vast amounts of public money on his private homestead. More recently, South Africans have been alarmed by the exposure of a network of influence inside Zumas administration controlled by the powerful Gupta family. Public support for Zuma has sunk, and the ANC is quietly fracturing. Meanwhile, South Africas economy entered an official recession this week, after economic growth fell below zero for the second straight quarter, defying rosier predictions to the contrary. Unemployment is soaring: South Africas official unemployment rate is now 27. 7% the highest in 13 years. The country has also suffered ratings downgrades from international credit agencies, giving the government less room to maneuver in stimulating economic growth. Conditions would seem ripe for the opposition, led by the Democratic Alliance (DA) to seize the advantage. (Full disclosure: I worked for the DA from 2002 to 2006 as a speechwriter for   of the Opposition Tony Leon.) Until recently, the DA was looking very strong, having won most of the countrys big cities in last years municipal elections. There were hopes that it could achieve the   feat of dislodging the ANC from power. However, the DA is wracked by internal conflict. The trigger for the internal fight was the reaction to a set of tweets by prominent DA figure Helen Zille, who governs the Western Cape province, in which she admired Singapores model of governance, which sees some aspects of colonialism as positive. Zille was then accused of downplaying colonialisms evils, and is currently being railroaded by party leaders through a kangaroo court disciplinary process. That   row reflects deeper fault lines about the ideological direction of the party. The DA needs to win black votes to compete at the national level. But it remains unclear how the party is to achieve that     whether by converting a broader electorate to its classical liberal vision of small government, or by becoming a more palatable version of the ANC, offering black voters the statist policies that they are more used to seeing, with a lighter touch. Meanwhile, on top of third word problems like violent crime, inadequate public education, and an HIV epidemic, South Africa has imported the first world problems of identity politics to the nations college campuses. In 2015, students at the University of Cape Town succeeded in convincing the administration to remove a statue of Cecil John Rhodes. Last year, they set fire to paintings of white people, one of which was an   painting. The countrys foreign relations have also suffered. The South African government has built closer ties with Russia, but on the basis of a nuclear power deal that is alleged to be corrupt. At the same time, relations with the U. S. under President Barack Obama deteriorated, starting with differences over the Libya War and continuing through a recent   dispute, which saw the Obama administration threaten to suspend South African trade benefits. The good news is that South Africas current crisis could still provide an opportunity for political change. The bad news is that the countrys prevailing political culture remains statist and   meaning that most of the proposed ideas for fixing the countrys problems will only make them worse. The country needs new ideas and new leadership. How it resolves its present crisis will determine its future     and, perhaps, that of Africa, and the ideals of the West. Joel B.

"Sheriff: Be Armed, Be Mentally Prepared, Make Terrorists Defend Their Lives for a Change - Breitbart",Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/9/2017,"Floridas Brevard County Sheriff Wayne Ivey is urging   Americans to arm up, get familiar with their firearm, and be ready to make terrorists worry about defending their own lives, for a change. [Ivey made these comments in a video he posted to Facebook in reaction to the horrendous attacks on unarmed,   Londoners. Looking at terror attacks around the world, Ivey observed:  Terrorists and active shooters are using every weapon available to target citizens. Guns, knives, trucks, hammers, and even explosives have all become the weapon of choice for murderers who only have one goal   killing innocent and   citizens. It seems that almost everyday we hear of another attack taking place at a concert, tourist destination, church, business, or anywhere else in the world where they can strike fear in the hearts of citizens. He urged Americans to take their safety seriously and to determine to be the first line of defense against a terror attack.  He stressed, Let me be perfectly clear, doing nothing or just hoping it wont happen to you is not going to save your life.  Ivey mentioned that officials in other parts of the world are teaching citizens that the best thing they can do is run, hide, tell, and he rejects that paradigm, citing the fact that this is war and you win a war by fighting     not by running. He points out that terrorists and active shooters know that our citizens have been coached to run and hide, and then patiently await help.  He said attackers count on Americans to respond this way, then added, What they dont count on is being attacked themselves.  Ivey says it is time to be prepared to counterattack to be armed and ready to make the terrorists fight to defend their own lives for a change, should they strike.  Ivey said: No matter who you are or what your position is on guns, there is no denying the fact that the only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun   or a knife   is an armed and   citizen or law enforcement officer. There is no doubt that as soon as 911 is called law enforcement is on the way, however, until they arrive it is up to you and those with you to neutralize or eliminate the threat.

Geert Wilders Will Not Be Prosecuted For 2015 Austrian Speech,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/9/2017,"Dutch prosecutors have announced they will not be pursuing charges against firebrand Dutch politician Geert Wilders for a speech he made in Austria in 2015. [Prosecutors rejected an appeal from an Austrian Muslim association to prosecute the populist politician for incitement after he made a strong   speech in Vienna in 2015. The Dutch prosecutors said the content of Mr. Wilders speech was not punishable by Dutch law and that they will not pursue the matter any further, NU. nl reports.  Wilders was invited by the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FP) in 2015 to give a speech on Islamisation at the Hofburg palace. During the speech, Wilders said: Islam calls on people to become terrorists     the Quran leaves no doubt about it.  He also stated: Islam is an ideology of war and hatred.  Wilders wrote a reply to the allegations saying that the charges were a legal jihad and while the elites are to blame for the existential crisis we are currently in, with their open   and unprecedented love for Islam and their cultural relativism, they sell us out completely and put our freedom and security at stake.  The Dutch prosecutor explained their decision saying: Only if a statement focuses on a group characterised by a belief may be punishable.  Wilders spoke on this occasion about Islam, not about Muslims, a group characterised by their Islamic faith. This falls under criticism in Dutch law and is not as insulting a group of people.  Wilders reacted to the decision on Twitter writing: Beautiful. The only right decision. The truth must be said and can be correct about Islam! Mooi. De enige juiste beslissing. De waarheid moet gezegd kunnen worden, juist over de islam! https:  .      Geert Wilders (@geertwilderspvv) June 7, 2017,  The attempt to have Wilders brought to court for hate speech charges is not the first time the Party for Freedom (PVV) leader has been charged with incitement. Earlier this year, he was found guilty and fined 5, 000 euros for a speech he made in 2011 talking about the crime rates of Morrocan migrants in the Netherlands. Wilders PVV made substantial gains in the Dutch national elections earlier this year becoming the second largest party in the country. As the coalition talks stall, Wilders has said the PVV is fully available to take part in a new coalition government. Current Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte has consistently said that he would not work with the PVV, as have other parties. If coalition talks continue to break down, the Netherlands could face the option of calling another election."

Feds Indict 33 Thief-in-Law Members of Russian Syndicate,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/9/2017,"defendants associated with a Russian    syndicate were arrested for a host of crimes. The arrests for alleged racketeering, extortion,    robbery, fraud, conspiracy, narcotics, and firearms spanned from Brighton Beach to Las Vegas, NYPD Commissioner James P. ONeill said. [The acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, Joon H. Kim, and officials with the New York Field Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) U. S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) announced three indictments and one complaint charging the 33 defendants.  Acting Manhattan U. S. Attorney Joon Kim said in a statement: [W]e have charged 33 members and associates of a Russian organized crime syndicate allegedly engaging a panoply of crimes around the country. The indictments include charges against the alleged head of this national criminal enterprise, one of the first federal racketeering charges ever brought against a Russian vor. The dizzying array of criminal schemes committed by this organized crime syndicate allegedly include a    conspiracy, a plot to rob victims by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, the theft of cargo shipments containing over 10, 000 pounds of chocolate, and a fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices. FBI Assistant    William F. Sweeney Jr. said, The suspects in this case cast a wide net of criminal activity, aiming to make as much money as possible, all allegedly organized and run by a man who promised to protect them. But that protection didnt include escaping justice and being arrested by the agents and detectives on the FBI New York Eurasian Organized Crime Task Force.  Court documents obtained allege members of the Shulaya Enterprise operated a complicated conspiracy dealing in stolen cigarettes,    the illegal sale of firearms to known felons, gambling activities, illegal debt collection, extortion, and other violent activities. Most members and associates of the Shulaya Enterprise were born in the former Soviet Union and many maintained substantial ties to Georgia, the Ukraine, and the Russian Federation, including regular travel to those countries, communication with associates in those countries, and the transfer of criminal proceeds to individuals in those countries, prosecutors stated in a   indictment. The Shulaya Enterprise was led principally by two individuals, Razhden Shulaya,    Brother,    Roma, and Zurab Dzhanashvili,    Zura, the defendants, who each coordinated and directed   members and associates of the Shulaya Enterprise.  Many of the counts in the indictment unsealed earlier this week dealt with trafficking stolen cigarettes and the operation of illegal gambling houses. In one count, suspects Shulaya, Dzhanashvili, and Akaki Ubilava (   Ako) met in one of the establishments to divide about $70, 000 in proceeds from a poker game. Other counts dealt with members of the syndicate dealing in stolen credit cards and bank account information. In an unusual case, defendant Dzhanashvili allegedly arranged for the transportation and sale of approximately 10, 000 pounds of stolen chocolate confections to a confidential informant working with law enforcement officials. The informant in this case also allegedly negotiated the purchase of multiple firearms from the defendants despite their knowledge he is a convicted felon, ineligible to legally purchase a pistol. Another count in the indictment alleges the suspects involvement in the trafficking of cocaine and heroin. Acting CBP New York Director Leon Hayward said, U. S. Customs and Border Protection is extremely proud to have assisted our federal partners in this operation.  It is through our interagency partnerships, and collaborative approaches like the one leading to todays arrests, that law enforcement successfully combats modern criminal organizations.  Acting U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York stated, he dizzying array of criminal schemes committed by this organized crime syndicate allegedly include a    conspiracy, a plot to rob victims by seducing and drugging them with chloroform, the theft of cargo shipments containing over 10, 000 pounds of chocolate, and a fraud on casino slot machines using electronic hacking devices. Thanks to the remarkable interagency partnership of FBI, CBP, and NYPD, we have charged and arrested 33 defendants allegedly involved in this criminal enterprise.  The Shulaya Enterprise operated what is referred to as a vor v zakonei or vor.  These are Russian phrases which translate to    or thief.

Marc Andreessen: If You Wanted the Truth During the 2016 Election You Read Breitbart - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/9/2017,"Billionaire tech entrepreneur and investor Marc Andreessen explained the downfall of the mainstream media during an interview at Recode this week, claiming If you actually wanted to, last year in 2016, read the story of the election and get the truth, you read Breitbart. [  Speaking at the Code 2017 conference, an   event hosted by Recode, Marc Andreessen made his feelings about the media clear. If you actually wanted to, last year in 2016, read the story of the election and get the truth, you read Breitbart, Andreessen declared. Now, nobody wants to hear that, because we all have concluded that Breitbart is absurd   propaganda and that somehow the traditional coastal press is somehow the truth, but its demonstrable last year that was not true.  So I think we all just need to take a step back from this idea that theres absolute truth, and that we somehow have some sort of monopoly or preferential access to it and the rest of these people kind of dont understand anything, he continued. By the way, its a surefire way to lose elections. If Democrats are ever going to win elections again in the center of the country and the south of the country, they have to show up with some message other than youre all a bunch of morons. Thats not going to work.  But thats not the point       thats an easy shorthand way of saying no matter what they say on the left, on either coast, is untrue, interrupted the moderator. You can say untruths to people and get them to vote a certain way. I mean you know that.  If you like your healthcare plan you can keep it. Right? Obama, 2008? Obamacare, hows that working out? Andreessen added. Im gonna close Guantanamo in my first year in office? Well the fact that politicians break some promises is not a very big       the moderator continued. If you read the press coverage of those promises at the time they were presented as truth, declared Andreessen. They were presented as yes, these are absolutely things that are going to happen. There were reams of coverage around Obamacare of how well it was going to work.  During his interview, Andreessen also explained how the general public used to be made to think by the media that Silicon Valley was a hotbed of crazy libertarians, despite the opposite being true. Of course our friend Peter [Thiel] was always held up       as kind of representative of the valley, he explained. A funny thing happened last year, which was it turns out that was fake news. It turns out that was not true. In fact it turns out the opposite is true, which is the 99. 999 percent of Silicon Valley is last year voted for Hillary Clinton, supported Hillary Clinton, donated to Hillary Clinton.  The money difference, it was like some giant multiple       Silicon Valley is extremely   extremely liberal, Andreessen concluded. I think its hard for people in Silicon Valley to even articulate the other side at this point, I think its hard to even articulate the case for voting for Donald Trump, its hard to articulate what people in the Midwest and South are thinking.

Spains Catalonia Announces October Independence Vote,Breitbart,Breitbart London,6/9/2017,"BARCELONA (AFP)     The leader of Spains Catalonia region, where a separatist movement is in full swing, on Friday announced an independence referendum for October 1 in defiance of Madrid. [People will be asked to vote on the question: Do you want Catalonia to be an independent state in the form of a republic, Carles Puigdemont said in Barcelona.  If Catalonias   authorities win, they have said they will immediately start proceedings to separate from Spain. But the central government in Madrid insists the procedure is not valid and the Catalan authorities face significant challenges to even hold the referendum. Catalonia, a wealthy, 7.   region with its own language and customs, has long demanded greater autonomy. For years separatist politicians in the northeastern region have tried to win approval from Spains central government to hold a vote similar to Scotlands 2014 independence referendum from Britain, which resulted in a no vote. And while Catalans are divided on the issue, with 48. 5 percent against independence and 44. 3 percent in favour according to the latest poll by the regional government, close to   support holding a referendum.     I dont want it     Catalan authorities have repeatedly been thwarted in their attempts to hold such a vote by the central government, which argues it goes against the constitution and would threaten the unity of Spain. In 2014, Catalonia held a   vote under then president Artur Mas, in which more than 80 percent of those who cast a ballot chose independence, although just 2. 3 million out of 6. 3 million eligible voters took part. But in holding the symbolic referendum, Mas went against Spains Constitutional Court, which had outlawed the vote     even if it was  . He was later put on trial and banned from holding office for two years. Puigdemont, though, still wants to go ahead, and he wants his referendum to be binding this time     even though Madrid has pledged to be just as tough this time round. I dont want it, I dont believe in it, and as long as I am prime minister, it wont happen, Spains Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said in May. In February, the Constitutional Court ruled against the referendum and warned Catalan leaders they faced repercussions if they continued with their project. Catalonias officials have had little luck pushing their project abroad either.     Challenges to organise vote     Regional authorities also face a host of challenges just to hold the referendum without Madrids consent. Civil servants such as the police or the heads of schools where polling stations could be set up, for instance, will be   for the organisation of such a vote. But they are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Regardless of what they support, they would have to choose between obeying their immediate superiors and facing possible sanctions for disobeying Spanish law, or sticking by the Constitution. Aside from that, none of the usual, necessary accessories of an election would be available, such as an official campaign or an independent authority to oversee the vote. And the central government has ways to stop the referendum from going ahead. It can ask the Constitutional Court to suspend Puigdemont for disobedience, or it could take temporary control of key Catalan functions such as the police."
Austrian Migrant Party To Stand In National Election,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/9/2017,"Austrias migrant party the New Movement for the Future (NBZ) have announced they will be fielding candidates across Austria for the snap national election in October. [The New Movement for the Future (NBZ) was formed by Turkish immigrants in the city of Voralburg and ran for office in local elections. Chairman Adnan Dincer, originally from Turkey, has now said the party is ready to field candidates in the Austrian national election planned for October 15th, Die Presse reports.  So far the NBZ has not announced where they will be running or who their candidates are but a party spokesman said the party had decided on Sunday to compete in the national elections. The party also announced they will move their headquarters to the Austrian capital of Vienna. In the next few weeks, the party is expected to start forming the appropriate structures to run a national election campaign and will likely produce their national platform as well as introduce their leading candidates for the election. Previously, party leader Adnan Dincer had claimed whilst the party was largely representative of migrant issues they were neither an Islamic nor a Turkish party.  He claimed the party would represent the interests of the forgotten and said that whilst many members are Muslim, religion is religion, politics is politics. In order to win seats in the Austrian parliament, the party needs to win at least four per cent of the vote, something the spokesman for the party saw as unrealistic. Instead, the party is looking to use the election raise its profile and offer voters an alternative. The Austrian snap election was called after former vice chancellor Reinhold Mitterlehner shocked the country by resigning and leading to a split between the grand coalition of his Austrian Peoples Party (VP) and Chancellor Christian Kerns Socialists (SP). Current polls show the   migration Freedom Party of Austria (FP) in second place ahead of the Socialists. New VP leader and Austrian Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz has steadily adopted many policies the FP have promoted for years including the recent banning of the   Islamic veil. Austria, Unique Research poll:  : 32%  : 26% : 21%  : 10%  : 6% #nrw17,     Europe Elects (@EuropeElects) June 3, 2017,  The leader of the FP   Strache has taken a hard line against Islamisation and has vowed to both ban Islamism and has floated the idea of putting known Islamists on island prisons away from society. If the current polling trends continue, a coalition government of the VP and the FP is likely, which has not happened since 2000 when Austria was threatened with sanctions from the European Union for allowing   of the FP Jrg Haider into government."
Planned Parenthood Videomaker Files Motion to Disqualify Judge Who Censored Videos - Breitbart,Breitbart,Dr. Susan Berry,6/9/2017,"Attorneys for David Daleiden and the Center for Medical Progress (CMP) have filed a motion requesting the disqualification of the federal judge who ordered videos showing abortionists discussing dismemberment of unborn babies to be removed from the Internet. [According to a motion filed in U. S. District Court in Northern California on June 7, the request for the disqualification of Judge William H. Orrick III is made on the grounds that there is evidence of bias in favor of the plaintiff and prejudice against the defendants.   The plaintiff in the case is the National Abortion Federation (NAF) which claims the videos would endanger the lives of their abortionists. In the latest CMP video, which is a compilation of excerpts from video filmed at NAF trade shows, abortionists are heard discussing, amid laughter, the difficulties they face in their jobs, such as the head that gets stuck that we cant get out, and an eyeball just fell down into my lap, and that is gross! At the end of May, Orrick censored any video links and references to the identities of NAF members. Following Orricks order, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, and LiveLeak deleted the video from their sites. In an interview with Breitbart News, Peter Breen, special counsel with the Thomas More Society     which represents Daleiden     said the motion is extremely significant. He explained: Bringing a motion to disqualify a federal judge is a very serious matter. Its not something that you do lightly, but in view of the evidence that has now come to light, we, as attorneys are duty bound, at this point, to bring the motion to disqualify. In fact, it would be malpractice for us not to. We believe the law requires disqualification. Breen continues: Some of the evidence weve brought forward is that as recently as September of 2015     several weeks after entering the temporary restraining order in the NAF case     weve learned that the Good Samaritan Family Resource Center, which is interlinked with a Planned Parenthood affiliate that is a member of the National Abortion Federation     that they are holding out Judge Orrick as an emeritus member of their board. The National Abortion Federation     their allegations were there would be harm to their members     and, so, youve got an entity that is in partnership with a member that actually hosts one of the NAF members. Now youve got the judge being held out by that entity as part of the organization, as connected to it. The motion states the request for Orricks disqualification is based upon evidence contained in an affidavit by Daleiden: This includes Judge Orricks longstanding relationship as a past board member, and more recently as an emeritus board member, of an organization that has a key partnership with a Planned Parenthood affiliate that is a member of the plaintiff National Abortion Federation (NAF). Judge Orricks wife has also posted public comments, pictured with her husband, that are supportive of Planned Parenthood and critical of these moving defendants. For this reason, and the others set forth below, Daleiden and CMP respectfully request that Judge Orrick be recused from this case and that a stay be granted on all proceedings in this case until this motion is heard. The affidavit contains Orricks United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees. In his responses to the questions, Orrick states, I advised Good Samaritan Family Resource Center when it was unionized, (p. 42) and After returning to San Francisco in 1984      I assisted the Good Samaritan Family Resource Center on many legal issues from 1986 to 2009.  (p. 44). The motion also cites Daleidens statement about Orricks wife, Caroline Orrick: I learned that, no later than the fall of 2015 Mrs. Orrick, pinkified her Facebook page and added the I stand with Planned Parenthood overlay across her profile picture. Planned Parenthood urged its supporters to add these elements to their Facebook pages as part of a social media campaign orchestrated specifically in response to the release of videos by myself and CMP. Pinkifying showed ones support for Planned Parenthood and ones belief that the videos were fraudulent. Just days ago, I further discovered that Mrs. Orrick liked a Facebook post by the National Abortion Rights Action League (NARAL) that described my and CMPs work as heavily edited videos by a sham organization run by extremists who will stop at nothing to deny women legal abortion services.  The Facebook post also appeared to describe our videos as domestic terrorism against abortion providers. Mrs. Orrick also liked a Facebook Post by Keep America   that applauded my indictment in Harris County, Texas, which was ultimately dismissed as invalid by two different judges. Both likes were accompanied by a profile picture featuring Judge and Mrs. Orrick. According to the document containing Orricks responses to the Questionnaire for Judicial Nominees, in June of 2009, Orrick introduced  . Kamala Harris ( ) at a fundraiser for her campaign at the time for her bid for the post of Californias attorney general [p. 23]. In addition, he states, I raised money and sponsored an event for the campaign of Kamala Harris for Attorney General in 2009, before I joined the Department of Justice.  (p. 31). Democrat Harris was elected California attorney general in 2010, barely defeating   Angeles district attorney Steven Cooley, a Republican, whose firm, Steven Cooley  Associates (SCA) now defends Daleiden and his colleague, Sandra Merritt, who have been charged with 15 felony counts under Californias law protecting confidential conversations.   General, now U. S. Sen. Kamala Harris, wielded unprecedented police power against a true American journalist while civil suits were already pending in Federal District Court concerning the same  says Cooley. Public Records Act requests filed by SCA reveal the Attorney Generals real interest in this case is entirely political, meant to manipulate the law to do the bidding of their benefactors at Planned Parenthood.  In September 2016, emails obtained by the Washington Times showed that   AG and U. S. Senate candidate Harriss office collaborated with Planned Parenthood to produce legislation that specifically targeted Daleiden. The emails, according to the Times, were accessed through a public records request, and revealed conversations between officials of Harriss office and Planned Parenthood regarding legislation that criminalizes undercover journalists for publishing and distributing recordings of private communications with abortion providers. On March 28, 2017, the new California Attorney General, Xavier Becerra, announced the criminal complaint charging Daleiden and Merritt with 15 felony counts against the states confidentiality legislation. Previously, Becerra was a longstanding Democratic congressman who received a total of $5, 535 from Planned Parenthood during his congressional election bids between 1998 and 2014, according to OpenSecrets. org. Harris is on record as having received $2, 600 in 2016 from Planned Parenthood for her Senate race campaign. Additionally, Harris was the recipient of $39, 855 from the Abortion    Rights lobby group, according to OpenSecrets. org. ElectionTrack. com reported Harris received $15, 000 from Planned Parenthood for her attorney general campaign bids."
Questions in CT Rage Over Boy Competing in High School Sports as a Girl,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/9/2017,"Andraya Yearwood has become a girls team track star for Cromwell High School in New Britain, Connecticut. It is no surprise, since the runner is a tall, strong, powerful biological boy who is posing as a girl despite not yet making any move to transition as a girl. [The mustachioed Yearwood, who competed as a boy in middle school, now claims to be a transgender girl and has been allowed to join the girls track team despite his imposing size and muscle mass that far exceeds that of his teammates and   more importantly   all his opponents on other school teams.  School officials, parents, and girls on opposing teams have bent themselves into pretzels to appear accepting and tolerant of Yearwoods gender proclamations. But, even as everyone walks on eggshells to grapple with the situation, Yearwood is racking up a record of wins in girls track, easily blowing away all competitors. Yearwood seems both arrogant and defiant celebrating the wins as if they are deserved and even expected. It feels really good. Im really happy to win both titles, Yearwood recently bragged to the media after winning the Class M contest. I kind of expected it. Ive always gotten first, so I expected it to some extent.        Im really proud of it.  Yearwoods lopsided wins have at last caused many to wonder if the teenagers overpowering male physical capabilities makes competing against girls unfair. These easy wins against biological girls have raised questions in New Britain. There is no better voice to these worries than Hartford Courant columnist Jeff Jacob who raised the questions in a June 1 column, saying that on a biologically competitive basis, Yearwoods victories are not fair to the competitors. Ultimately, Jacobs felt that the results of the competitions are tainted. Humanity counts. So does biology, Jacobs wrote. But, he went on saying, For me, somebody who has observed sports and written about all kinds of athletes for four decades, the integrity of the state competition for these two races Tuesday was compromised.  Now, another voice has been added to Jacobs as USA Today columnist Cam Smith raised Jacobs points and added that he also sees how murky this situation really is. Like others, Smith bent over backward to appear accepting of the teens gender choices, but he echoed Jacobs in wondering if it was fair to have a physically stronger boy competing against weaker and slower girls. Without specifically coming down on any side of the issue, Smith nonetheless pointed out that the situation in Connecticut raises some vexing questions: We cant encourage you enough to read Jacobs entire piece, and to think about its larger implications. The state of Connecticut is clearly stuck in a delicate tap dance, and perhaps the most significant takeaway is how well everyone seems to be putting an awkward and potentially explosive situation into broader perspective. Of course, the situation is only delicate if you think honoring Yearwoods desire to be a girl is more important than fair treatment for the literally hundreds of girls in the schools competition district who are denied any fair chance of winning a track meet in which Yearwood competes.

Geller: Linda Sarsour Rakes in Thousands with Fundraiser for Islamophobia Victim Accused of Mob Violence - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pamela Geller,6/9/2017,"Amid what is now an epidemic of fake hate crimes there comes a strange and peculiar incident, which bears all the signs of being yet another hate hoax.[    activist Linda Sarsour has raised $110, 000 and counting on the alleged beating of a Muslim woman in Columbus, Ohio     an area very heavily populated with Muslims, where a young Muslim woman, Rifqa Bary, had to flee for her life ten years ago after she said her father threatened to kill her for converting to Christianity, and one mosque has a history of terror ties.  On Sunday morning, Sarsour tweeted: Please support Rahma, who was brutally beaten yesterday by a white male in Columbus, OH. This is unacceptable. https:  . gofundme. >crowdfunding campaign dedicated to the support of the    girl who was raped by Muslim migrants took a full year to reach $80, 000. While this crowdfunding page was receiving a huge number of donations with no publicity, the media coverage that there initially was on this case suddenly disappeared, without explanation. Columbus ABC6 did a story on it, headlined Family of Muslim woman calling alleged assault a hate crime, but a couple of short hours after it went online, it disappeared. It wasnt retracted the space where it was now bears the notice, Hmmm, we couldnt find the page you were looking for.  Aside from this mysteriously vanished ABC6 story, I initially only found two articles about the case. One was on the Muslim site bartamaha. com. The other is on a   site called CarbonatedTV, which states that the victim said the man was interviewed by the police but released without charges.  It also notes that the   Council on   Relations (CAIR) is involved in the case, quoting Jennifer Nimer, executive director of  : The fact that the perpetrator was not taken into custody and was not charged raises serious concerns and sends a very dangerous message.  The national CAIR site also contains a press release about this alleged incident. A rally that had been scheduled for Warsame on Monday was canceled, also only a few short hours after it was announced. The Columbus Underground page announcing the rally now bears the cryptic explanation: This rally is being postponed per the request of family lawyer. The family and friends are further discussing it and will announce a new date for this event soon.   First, Columbus police issued a statement refusing to acknowledge the incident as a hate crime.  According to the NBC affiliate WKYC, they could not arrest anyone at the scene due to the lack of physical evidence and conflicting stories by everyone involved. They noted that they arrived on the scene not in response to any reports of hate crimes, but because multiple citizens had reported public child abuse and potential child abduction. WKYC notes that police did not name anyone involved.  The Daily Caller reported Monday, before the police statement came out, a version of the story that corresponded with the WKYC report. The outlet claimed that there was another victim in the incident: a woman named Samantha Morales, who said that Sarsour and CAIR have the story all wrong, including the allegations that racial epithets were hurled at Warsame.   Morales stated, according to the Daily Caller, that the incident began when a woman of African heritage who lives in her apartment complex was yelling at and hitting her son with a shoe.  Morales tried to intervene, whereupon she was attacked first by a mob of men and women, including Warsame, following a neighborhood argument involving a woman and her son.    Said Morales: What happened is not what she is claiming. The woman that is in the hospital, I feel sorry for her, but she is one of the women who was kicking and hitting me after I got tased.  It was Morales boyfriend, Boyce, who according to Warsame hurled racial epithets at her. Morales and Boyce deny this. With major challenges to Warsames story surfacing, many questions remain. Where is all this money for Rahma Warsame coming from? With Warsame exposed, what will it now go to fund? Why arent there more journalists who are pursuing the questionable aspects of this story and challenging Sarsours version of the incident and the fundraising efforts based thereon? Would doing that be Islamophobic?

CNN Drops Reza Aslan Series After Vulgar Anti-Trump Tweets,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/9/2017,"After CNN host Reza Aslan stirred controversy with a series of vulgar tweets against President Trump and others, the cable news network has dropped plans to move forward on Believer, Aslans spiritual adventure series that purported to explore religious ideas across the world. [CNN has decided to not move forward with production on the acquired series Believer with Reza Aslan, the network said in a statement reported by Variety. We wish Reza and his production team all the best.   Had CNN picked up the show, it would have entered into its second season. Aslan released a statement accusing CNN of trying to protect its brand.  He insisted his show stands for tolerance, but his personal statements reflect his role as a social commentator and scholar rather than a journalist. My statement about the cancellation of #Believer pic. twitter.      Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) June 9, 2017,  The parting of ways comes as Aslan stirred controversy with a June 3 Twitter attack on President Trump, calling the president a piece of shit.  This piece of shit is not just an embarrassment to America and a stain on the presidency. Hes an embarrassment to humankind, Aslan, a man who claims to be a student of religion, wrote in a tweet he later deleted. It turns out the June 3 tweet was not the only time Aslan used Twitter to attack the president in vulgar terms. After Aslans   of Trump had gone viral, Twitter users began combing through his feed and found many other examples of the CNN hosts   comments. Twitter users quickly found that Aslan had called the president and his eldest son the   in a past tweet, and in another case, Aslan tweeted that he hoped someone would rape GOP congressional candidate Todd Akin. Twitter users next discovered that Aslan began deleting his problematic tweets after they were uncovered. Aslan also stirred controversy on his CNN show. The host was heavily criticized for eating part of a human brain during a segment about a Hindu sect in India on his CNN series, Believer. The U. S. India Political Action Committee slammed Aslans actions, saying, With multiple reports of   attacks against people of Indian origin from across the US, the show characterizes Hinduism as cannibalistic, which is a bizarre way of looking at the third largest religion in the world.  In another case, Aslan upset Christians when he excoriated the Christian Bible as replete with historical errors.  It is interesting that CNN completely ignored Aslans many off color and vulgar tweets until now. He has a long history of such tweets liberally dropping   and using the   time and again. For a man who claims to be a student of religion he certainly uses an awful lot of foul language. In one tweet Aslan accused House Speaker Paul Ryan of saying f*ck Syrian moms, in another he told conservative commentator Dinesh DSouza to go f*ck himself, then he guffawed that Trump didnt sh*t himself in public, and those are just a few examples. Except of course Syrian moms fleeing war, famine, and genocide with their starving children. Fuck those moms. https:  .      Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) May 14, 2017,  Hey Dinesh. Ill say this as politely as I can: Go fuck yourself, you adulterous piece of shit felon. https:  .

Reza Aslan (@rezaaslan) May 29, 2017,  In fact, on May 9, Aslan arguably said something far worse about Trump than he did in the Tweet that got him fired by CNN: Oh the joy when this lying conniving scumbag narcissistic sociopath piece of shit fake president finally gets whats coming to him.

In Pictures: Leftist Anti-May Protesters Outside Downing Street - Breitbart,Breitbart,Victoria Friedman,6/9/2017,"After a disastrous snap general election result for the Conservatives, which saw the party lose 12 seats and resulted in a hung parliament, a small group of leftists have staged a protest outside Downing Street. [Two protests were organised for Friday evening: May Must Go     Tories Out and another organised by the Lambeth National Union of Teachers (NUT). Banners from the Socialist Worker and Stand up to Racism were also seen at the event. Around 100 people attended.  Lambeth NUT called Thursday nights results a disaster for the Tories, and a stunning result for   and   politics. Theresa May has no right to remain as Prime Minister. Her mandate has been decimated, the group added on Facebook. Lambeth NUT supported and received support from the organisers of the May Must Go     Tories Out which called the general election a stunning result for Corbyn. Protesters chanted Say hey, say ho, tell Theresa May to go! Tories! Tories! Tories! Out! and Jezza! Jezza! Jezza! In! In! In! Winning only 318 seats     falling eight short of the 326 needed for a majority     the Conservative Party will work with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) with Prime Minister Theresa May leading the minority government. Mrs. May told the BBC she was very sorry for the MPs who lost their seats. She said she obviously wanted a different result and would reflect on what has happened. Apart from the prime minister remaining in post, cabinet ministers Philip Hammond (Chancellor of the Exchequer) Boris Johnson (Foreign Secretary) Amber Rudd (Home Secretary) Sir Michael Fallon (Defence Secretary) and David Davis (Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union) will keep their roles. Labour won a strong majority of the seats where turnout increased by more than 5 per cent, with roughly 70 per cent of 18        voting nationwide. As a result of the UK Independence Party vote being decimated, Paul Nuttall resigned as leader which was followed by calls for former leader Nigel Farage to return to run the party."
Tech CEOs Plan to Attend Jared Kushner-Led White House Summit - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/9/2017,"A number of leading technology CEOs will visit the White House later this month for a technology summit led by Donald Trumps    and close adviser Jared Kushner. [Top technology executives including Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Apple CEO Tim Cook, and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will attend the American Technology Council meeting where they will discuss the modernization of government services. However, Facebook has yet to respond to the invitation.  The meeting comes after seven leading technology companies paid for a   ad in The New York Times urging Donald Trump to reverse his decision to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement earlier this month. Meanwhile, Tesla CEO Elon Musk confirmed he would quit the White House advisory council over Trumps decision to pull out. Am departing presidential councils. Climate change is real. Leaving Paris is not good for America or the world.     Elon Musk (@elonmusk) June 1, 2017,  The meeting will be led by Trumps    Jared Kushner, alongside a number of government officials, where they will discuss future collaboration between technology firms and the government, as well as future deals between them and federal agencies. The American Technology Council was formed by Trump in May as part of an effort to upgrade the U. S. governments use of digital services. The executive order signed by Trump read: It is the policy of the United States to promote the secure, efficient and economical use of information technology to achieve its missions. Americans deserve better digital services from their government. To effectuate this policy, the federal government must transform and modernize its information technology and how it uses and delivers digital services. In the   to last years presidential election, the vast majority of prominent technology executives, such as Facebook   Dustin Moskovitz, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and Apple CEO Tim Cook, actively endorsed Hillary Clintons candidacy against Donald Trump. However, in December last year, Trump held a meeting with a number of Silicon Valley leaders in which he promised to make it a lot easier for [them] to trade across borders.

Video Shows Texas Dem Encouraging Sanctuary Protesters from House Floor,Breitbart,Bob Price,6/9/2017,"A new video captures a Texas Democrat encouraging protest disruptions from the floor of the State House of Representatives last week. The video was taken moments before the   confrontation between Republican Rep. Matt Rinaldi ( ) and Hispanic Democrat legislators. [The cell phone video taken from the floor of the Texas House by State Representative Mark Keough (  Woodlands) shows Democrat State Representative Ramon Ramero (  Worth) chanting Hey, Hey. Ho, Ho. SB4 has got to go! House rules and order prohibit such behavior by representatives.   This is such an embarrassment for the legislature, Rep. Keough told Breitbart Texas in an exclusive interview. The people in the gallery were holding up signs saying they are in the country illegally, and Democrat state reps are cheering them on.  We all took the same oath to uphold and defend the Constitutions of Texas and the United States at the beginning of the session, the Republican representative continued. And here they were, encouraging lawless behavior.  Keough told Breitbart Texas that House rules expressly prohibit this type of conduct. Unfortunately, the House    and other security personnel were upstairs in the gallery dealing with the disruptive crowd, he explained. When the Speaker calls for order, you are supposed to settle down, but they just continued encouraging the crowd. I couldnt believe it.  The chants from protesters came after the House Speaker had ordered Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) troopers to clear the House Gallery of protesters who were attempting to disrupt the final day of the legislative session. Romero and other Democrat state representatives were seen by their Republican colleagues as egging on the protesters while law enforcement officers tried to maintain peace and order. State Representative Jonathan Stickland ( ) told Breitbart Texas that at this point when the video by Keough was filmed, several DPS troopers had been assaulted and pushed down the steps in the gallery by the crowd. These troopers were trying to restore order, and Democrats were egging them on from the floor, Stickland said. I have never seen anything like this in the House.  Rinaldi would later accuse Romero of physically assaulting him after he told Democrat reps he had called ICE on the protesters claiming to be illegal aliens. When I told the Democrats I called ICE, Representative Ramon Romero physically assaulted me, and other Democrats were held back by colleagues, Rinaldi posted on Facebook. This session has seen the passage of historic, but emotional legislation relating to prohibiting sanctuary cities in Texas. Senate Bill 4, authored by Senator Charles Perry ( ) is now the law of the state. The law which prohibits sheriffs and police chiefs from ignoring immigration detainers and having policies forbidding officers from asking about immigration status becomes effective on September 1, 2017. The bill provides civil fines and even criminal penalties to law enforcement officials choosing to ignore immigration authorities. This new law was the focus of protesters on the final day of the session. The emotional debate over the bill left emotional scars on relationships between representatives with opposing viewpoints. In a few weeks, the legislature will reconvene in a special session called by Governor Greg Abbott on July 18.

Jewish Voter Threatened By Crowbar Weilding Man Shouting Kill All the Jews at London Polling Station,Breitbart,Donna Rachel Edmunds,6/9/2017,"A man was arrested outside a polling station Thursday evening, after shouting   abuse at a Jewish voter and threatening people with a crowbar.

What are you doing here? at a Jewish man as he arrived at the polling station at Clapham Common, Stamford Hill, to cast his ballot in the general election.  Staff were forced to intervene, leading the frightened voter to safety, the Evening Standard has reported. At about 5pm the attacker returned, shouting more abuse at voters and wielding a crowbar, at which point the police were called to the scene.

Congressional Investigators Probe James Comey Leak Network - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/9/2017,"A bipartisan group of powerful senators is asking the man believed to have helped   Director James Comey leak his infamous let this go memo to the media to produce that memo for them. [Senators Chuck Grassley ( ) Diane Feinstein ( ) Lindsey Graham ( ) and Sheldon Whitehouse ( )     the chairs and ranking Democrats of the Senate Judiciary Committee and its National Security Subcommittee     sent a letter Thursday to Columbia Law Professor Daniel Richman demanding he provide them with the original memo he supposedly leaked to CNN on Comeys  .  The letter calls the memo, reported to describe President Donald Trump telling Comey to go easy on former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, relevant to the Judiciary Committees ongoing investigative efforts.  The letter also demanded all other memoranda Comey may have provided Richman and gave him only until midnight Friday. Breitbart News cannot confirm if Richman complied with the senators demands. Richman confirmed to multiple news outlets Thursday that he was the friend whom Comey enlisted to leak the memo to the press. This ended speculation that began immediately after Comey admitted under oath he had leaked the memo containing his account of conversations between himself and President Donald Trump. Comey claimed that his hope in doing so, immediately after he was fired, was to force the appointment of a special counsel, which has now come to pass in the person of Comeys predecessor as head of the FBI, Robert Mueller. Richman reportedly went into hiding after his name hit the national news and has not been seen in his Brooklyn neighborhood since. His disappearance from view as the request for the memo pends has raised questions about the memo, the validity of which Comey swore by in his Thursday testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee. Sharyl Attkisson, reporter for Full Measure News, tweeted her skepticism in light of these developments, including Comeys own testimony that he no longer has an original copy himself: Seems strange that Comey wd give his memo to friend to give to NYT but not give to Congress now says he has no copy https:  .

"125,000 DACA Illegals Got Work Permits Since January - Breitbart",Breitbart,Ben Kew,6/9/2017,"125, 000 illegal immigrants have won new or updated work permits and residency permits since January 2017, according to data published by the U. S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). [Officials at the agency accepted new requests from 17, 275 illegals from January 1 to March 31 and approved   extensions for 107, 524 of the illegals who earlier got work permits, Social Security cards and federal financial aid via the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals   created by former President Barack Obama in the   to the 2012 election.  President Donald Trump was inaugurated January 2o, ensuring most of the new and renewed DACA work permits were approved during his presidency, despite his campaign promises to halt the DACA program which now includes roughly 765, 000 younger illegal immigrants. Trumps supporters should use their political clout to make Trump do the right thing, said Mark Krikorian, director of the Center for Immigration Studies. Now we have data, and theres no question that hes issuing thousands of work permits to new illegal aliens        so probably the correct approach [for Trump supporters] is a determined insistence on [Trump] doing the right thing, he said.  The administration is doing a lot of good stuff on immigration, Krikorian added, noting that Trump is under constant pressure from liberals who wont give him any credit even when he does something they prefer.  The DACA population is large, given that 4 million young Americans enter the job market each year to face job competition from up to 1 million new immigrants, from 1 million temporary contract workers and from the resident population of 8 million working illegal immigrants.

In that case, announcing that renewals would continue until, say, the end of the year could be a powerful motivator for congressional Democrats. My speculation is that the White House has no idea what to do about DACA and so is just letting it continue on autopilot     amnestying 192 new illegals a day. John Kelly, the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, said June 7 that officials are not seeking to repatriate DACA illegals. We are not, not, not, targeting DACA registrants right now, he said. Critics say the DACA program may be vulnerable to a lawsuit by immigration reformers. We will immediately terminate President Obamas two illegal executive amnesties in which he defied federal law and the Constitution to give amnesty to approximately five million illegal immigrants, five million, Trump said August 31, 2016, referring to the DACA and the   DAPA amnesty, which was struck down by a federal court in Texas.

Melania Trump moves in,CNN,Kate Bennett,6/9/2017,"(CNN) With a single tweet on Sunday evening, Melania Trump made it official: the White House is no longer operating with a first lady in absentia. FLOTUS has moved in. Looking forward to the memories well make in our new home! #Movingday, read the tweet, which featured a picture from inside the Executive Residence, past the Truman Balcony, overlooking the South Lawn. On what appeared to be a set dining room table, two tall, tapered candles in silver holders were lit. Trump, who has performed duties as she can, when she can, during her brief visits to Washington over the past five months, has been far from a regular presence at the White House. The most consecutive days the public has seen the first lady were in May abroad, when she accompanied President Donald Trump on his first international trip. Her choice to remain in the couples New York City penthouse until their son, Barron, 11, finished the school year, while unprecedented, was certainly her prerogative as a parent, as disruptions impact children.  However, her communications director Stephanie Grisham tells CNN that Trump is now more than ready to be a Washington resident. The first lady is very excited about this chapter in their lives. She recognizes this as the true honor that it is, and looks forward to their years ahead in the White House. How it works, In February, Trump announced she had selected an interior designer, Tham Kannalikham, to decorate the familys private living quarters in the White House    more than a dozen rooms    a job that presumably is now complete. Kannalikham did not return a request for comment.  The first familys   must be flawlessly executed, said Rear Admiral Stephen Rochon, who served as director of the executive residence and chief usher at the White House under both Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, until 2011.  Very importantly, dcor of the rooms for Mrs. Trump and her son must be closely coordinated with the first ladys interior decorator. Hopefully, many of these things were done before President Trump moved in more than 100 days ago, Rochon said.  Rochon was succeeded by Angella Reid, whose surprise departure the White House announced last month with little explanation.  She is no longer employed here at the White House, deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at the time. We left on very good terms and wish her the very best and certainly hope for great things for her in the future.  When he the White House in 2011 for a position at the Department of Homeland Security, Rochon made sure Reid was prepped for the arrival of the next President and his or her family.  I left a detailed list, and met with (Reid) to answer any questions, said Rochon. I understand that Mrs. Trumps sons comfort is her top priority, so the chief usher must do everything possible not to disappoint her. (Moving to the White House) can, indeed, be organized chaos. But by the time the rest of the Trump family arrives, they should have everything they need at their fingertips. Clothes will be unpacked in the closets, settled in the bureaus toys and books and personal items will already be set up per the first ladys selection, the fridge stocked with favorite snacks preferred by the first lady and the littlest Trump.  A list of personal care products and brands used by the first family would likely already have been submitted for the East Wing staff to collect and have on hand.  Its definitely a 10 on the scale of exciting moves that we have handled, says Chuck Kuhn, president and CEO of JK Moving Services, a   moving company that has both moved presidents into    and out of    the White House, including both Bushes and the Clintons.   Kuhn said he hasnt been involved with the Trump moves, but that hed welcome the opportunity if asked. The movers go through background checks, and the trucks are inspected before going onto the grounds, said Kuhn. But from the driveway into the house, moving is handled by residence staff. Its up to the chief usher, or now the deputy usher, in the absence of a replacement for Reid, to oversee everyone    and take care of, well, everything.  When I was there, we had 95   staff members to include the ushers office, operations staff, who move furniture, rugs, et cetera, said Rochon. And then the executive chefs and pastry chefs, housekeepers, electricians, carpenters, engineers, plumbers, painters, florists and very importantly, the butlers, whom the first family sees, first and last, every day.  In sum, its a lot. Melania Trump will rely heavily on the head usher, said Rochon, whose job it is to navigate requests on her behalf.  The chief usher is the first ladys primary contact in the executive residence to get anything done there, he said, adding he suspects at this point the painters, carpenters and movers have already completed dcor tasks. How life changes, Its the little things you miss, said Michelle Obama to Oprah Winfrey at a womens summit in Washington last June. She was talking about life inside the White House, and how just walking out the front door without discussing it with anyone becomes a big deal.  Sasha opened her window once (in the White House) and there were calls. It never opened again, Obama said. The same restrictions and rules will be in place once Trump is a   resident as well.  Even though FLOTUS and Barron are moving to the 18 Acres, as the White House and its grounds are nicknamed, over time, all occupants inevitably feel trapped, said Jonathan Wackrow, a CNN law enforcement analyst and former Secret Service Agent, who spent time on a first lady detail.  In New York City, both of them basically hide in plain sight, blending into the fabric of the city is an easier task, he said.  Living at the White House, Trump will become a focal point of the city of Washington itself, with every move watched by staff, press and the public.  Privacy becomes the most craved desire, but it can be hard to come by, said Wackrow, adding it falls to Melania Trump, as it did to Michelle Obama, to help her family adjust.  The addition of Secret Service, motorcades, sirens and armed guards is a jolt, said Wackrow, although it is likely helpful that Trump has had a significant taste of what thats like for the past several months.  The DC pressure is a new normal for the family. All of them, the President included, will need to find a tempo that works for them to create an environment that is their own, Wachrow said.  For example, President Barack Obama often said it was helpful that he lived above the store so he could eat dinner with his family, before working later into the night.  He and Mrs. Obama would also workout together in the mornings a good deal, Wackrow said.  And while perhaps a morning bout of couples exercise wont be on the Trumps agenda, they will presumably find a way to   inside the bubble of the Residence.  Theyll do what works for them, said Wackrow. Whats next?  For Melania Trump, now is when the real work could begin.  A platform of initiatives is still in the works, although the first lady has publicly stated women and childrens issues are of importance.  It took Michelle Obama a year to announce Lets Move, so there is time, said Kate Andersen Brower, a CNN contributor and author of First Women: The Grace and Power of Americas Modern First Ladies and The Residence: Inside the Private World of the White House. It was also one of the more stressful parts of those first few months for Obama, trying to zero in on a campaign that she felt strongly about and that wouldnt offend (too) many people. I dont know what Melania is considering but with all the turmoil in her husbands administration this doesnt seem like a priority, Brower said. So far, in Washington, Trump has visited a childrens hospital and a couple of schools. Shes hosted one official ball (Februarys Governors Ball) presided over her first White House Easter Egg Roll and given a speech on female heroes at the State Department, to name a handful of her most notable Washington experiences to date.  Last week, she and the President stepped out on the town for the first time, well, not counting a few steak dinners at the Trump International Hotel. The couple attended the Fords Theatre Gala, Trump dressed in a   flowing $2, 595 silk frock by designer Monique Lhuillier. The next night, they hosted a reception at the White House for Gold Star families.  Melania Trump is also expected to fill out her staffing needs, building teams for communications, platform and events.  The job of first lady isnt salaried, nor is it outlined with any formal description, but tradition and history, which Trump appears to relish, dictate the wife of the President be a present, photographed, quoted and relevant member of the administration.  Its now up to Trump to establish just what kind of first lady she will be.  The first first lady to popularize having a campaign was Lady Bird Johnson with the highway beautification act, said Brower. Rosalynn Carter took on mental health from then on, having a message has been really an expected part of the job. On Friday, Trump got in on the fundraising part of the gig, putting her name to a letter asking supporters to sign a birthday card for her husband, who turns 71 on June 14    signing requires a donation to the Trump Make America Great Again Committee.  I need your help to make it a birthday my husband will never forget, said the letter. Our celebrations always include family and close friends.  This year, that celebration could likely take place at the White House, with the entire Trump clan in attendance, herself included."

US officials credit Russia for calming tense situation in Southern Syria,CNN,Barbara Starr,6/9/2017,"(CNN) US officials are crediting Russia with helping calm the situation in southern Syria, where the US has had to launch several airstrikes against Iranian backed Shia militias and   fighters in recent days. Pentagon spokesman US Navy Captain Jeff Davis stated: Russia has been very helpful and I think the calm that we see today is largely due to their efforts. The incidents marked an escalation in the area around   a garrison on the   border manned by US and British Special Forces that are advising an   Syrian rebel group known as Maghawir   or the Commandos of the Revolution. But the Pentagon is also stressing that it wants to remain focused on defeating ISIS and doesnt want to be diverted from its primary mission. We are in Syria to defeat ISIS   anything else we do there is in   only. We do not seek conflict with the Syrian regime or with these   militias or Iranian proxy forces, Davis said. The US has been using its so called   communications line with Russia to request they call militias on the ground and get them to move to less threatening positions. A 55 kilometer   zone has been established around the garrison. While the zone has no formal legal standing, the US has dropped leaflets and passed messages via the Russians. Davis said there had been multiple contacts with Russia, including at senior military levels.  For their part, the Russians have been privately supportive of the US efforts, according to the Pentagon, although they have remained publicly critical. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, responding to a US airstrike in the area earlier in the week said, The attack by the US led coalition in   region is an aggressive act infringing the sovereignty and the territorial integrity of the Syrian Arab Republic. Privately, US military officials say they are hopeful matters will remain calm and no more US military action will be required. It reached a peak Thursday when a US   jet shot down an   Shahed 129 drone, which was being controlled from a location in Syria north of   according to a US official. There were two additional US airstrikes this week against militia positions and vehicles, plus another airstrike in May.  Separately another US defense official said some 200 fighters remain several dozen miles outside of the   zone border with tanks and artillery. Currently they do not pose a threat, but the US is watching them carefully in case they move closer. Until now, the US had viewed the Russians as having little influence over the militia units in the area. These are not forces that are under Russian command and control, these are   militias, Davis said, adding: Russia is powerless to stop it but Russia can certainly pass these messages and relay our concerns and that seems to be working effectively. Another US official told CNN they believe the militias were conducting probing attacks, setting up a series of   as part of an effort to establish a strategic overland route from Iran to the Mediterranean coast."
Uber driver gets extra tip from NFLer for 8-hour ride,CNN,Emanuella Grinberg,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Uber driver Hadi Abdollahian thought he was signing up for a   drive to suburban Buffalo Grove, Illinois, when he picked up a passenger Sunday night at Chicagos OHare International Airport. But the Iranian refugee didnt think twice when he found out the actual destination was Buffalo, NEW YORK, some 500 miles and eight hours from Chicago. After all, the passenger told him it was an emergency: He had to work in the morning and he had missed his connecting flight. There was no other way to get there in time. Im a man of my words and if someone says its an emergency he really means it, said Abdollahian, 26. He would soon learn the passenger in his Nissan Altima was new Buffalo Bills player Shareece Wright, who was on his way to his first day of voluntary offseason practice. They arrived at 1 Bills Drive with mere minutes to spare before 7 a. m. meetings, Wright said. The defensive cornerback tipped Abdollahian $300 on top of the $632. 08 ride in a delightful vignette of the sharing economy bringing people together. But the story didnt end there.  The Bills lauded Wright for his dedication to his new team. The former Baltimore Raven was more impressed with his drivers dedication to getting him to Buffalo on a moments notice. Wright said he had changed his flight from California to give himself extra time to connect. But due to flight delays, he missed it anyway and the next one was not until the morning.  He was stressed. He called two Uber drivers and both canceled on him as soon as they found out the final destination (Uber does not reveal the destination until the passenger gets in the car and the driver starts the trip). On the third try, Abdollahian did not skip a beat when Wright told him he meant New York, not Illinois. He didnt complain once. He kept me from stressing out. The only thing he complained about was people driving 50 miles an hour, Wright said. His focus was to get me there on time and he did. Road trip bonds form, They talked for hours and shared their lives with each other, the two men told CNN. Abdollahian revealed his dream of becoming an astronaut Wright talked about his family and how he broke into professional football.  Wright was struck by Abdollahians story of his journey to the United States from Iran. He said he left the country in 2011 amid circumstances too painful to share. Abdollahian said he spent two years in Turkey before entering the United States in 2013 as a refugee. The story of his resilience to come to the US alone with no family and learn English, it says a lot, Wright said. Abdollahian landed in Chicago and got a job while he studied computer science at Harold Washington College, he said. He graduated in December with an associates degree and started driving for Uber after his company laid him off, he said. He applied to Loyola University Chicago and said he was accepted. Now hes just figuring out how to pay for it.  An extra tip, When local company Bluerock Energy heard about the road trip they gave Wright a check to reimburse him for the Uber ride. But Wright thought Abdollahian deserved it more than he did and passed it along. Anyones whos that passionate and focused about what hes doing, Im more than willing to help anyone whos putting that foot forward to be successful. Abdollahian confirmed that he received the check and shared a picture of it on Twitter. Its his only proof of the trip    he didnt ask for a selfie or take a pictures because he didnt want to be that guy, he said. Cheesy as it may sound, he considers his new friendship with Wright to be the greatest benefit of the trip.  He was so friendly. I loved his company, I wasnt expecting to meet someone like this, he told CNN. I really appreciate him."
Scottish referendum in doubt after steep losses for SNP in UK vote,CNN,Euan McKirdy,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Scottish National Party (SNP) leader Nicola Sturgeons continued support for a second independence referendum appears to have backfired, after her party endured a series of shock defeats in Thursdays UK general election. The party lost a total of 21 seats across Scotland, including that of SNP deputy leader Angus Robertson, and former party leader and SNP heavyweight Alex Salmond. The sizable losses appear to have been a repudiation of the partys promise to send Scots back to the polls for a second independence vote.  In the early hours of Friday morning, Sturgeon admitted the poor results meant she would need to reflect on the appetite for a referendum. Sturgeon told the BBC that a   uncertainty was a factor in peoples voting choices and certainly the independence referendum is part of that.  Scottish Conservative Party leader Ruth Davidson, euphoric about her partys gains in Scotland, said that IndyRef 2, the colloquial name for a second referendum, was dead in the water. I think we have seen the countrys reaction in the number of SNP seats falling, she told the BBC. Indyref 2 is dead. Sturgeon: We could be part of progressive coalition, Sturgeon put a positive spin on the losses    which saw her party reduced to to just 35 MPs across Scotland    arguing the SNP was still the   party in parliament and as such would have a role to play. Now, we have to wait and see how things shake out. But Ive always said    the SNP would want to be part of a progressive alternative to a Tory government. Asked about the partys losses in Scotland, Sturgeon said: Im not going to stand here and say Im not disappointed the SNP lost seats. But. .. this is our second best ever result, and weve won the election in Scotland. We got more seats. .. than all the other parties combined. Brexit fallout, The SNP had argued that Scots deserved a   of the 2014 independence referendum, which the leave campaign lost by around 5%.  The calls came in the wake of 2015s Brexit referendum, which Scottish voters overwhelmingly rejected, but will be forced to accept as long as they remain part of the UK. The Scottish Parliament gave the green light for a second independence referendum in March, but any vote would need to be ratified by Westminster, and Prime Minister Theresa May has already rejected this timetable.  The party made huge gains across Scotland in the 2015 General Election, all but wiping out Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats north of the border each party retained only one seat each. Sturgeon railed against Mays approach to Brexit, arguing that the UK was headed towards a bad deal. May hit back at Sturgeon for her tunnel vision. Turning tides, Speaking as the SNPs deputy leader lost his Moray seat to Conservative challenger Douglas Ross, CNNs Nic Robertson said that he had noticed some sensitivity with Angus Robertson on the campaign trail.  I can only put that down to how he felt in the run up to the election, what he was hearing on the doorsteps wasnt so pleasing to the ears. Speaking to Scottish voters, Robertson said that the message emerging from the country was that the SNPs drive for a second independence referendum has driven voters away from them. Perhaps this is one area where Theresa May delivered, he said.  We know when she took over . .. one of the things she spoke most passionately about was keeping the union together. Well it appears that calling this snap election at least does dent the SNPs prospects of calling for a second independence referendum. .. so in that context Theresa May perhaps has delivered. .. a United Kingdom remaining united."
Trump bets theres no smoking gun in Comey case,CNN,Stephen Collinson,6/9/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump may just have bet the farm. Trump said Friday that he was ready to testify under oath to special counsel Robert Mueller to deny former FBI chief James Comeys claim that the President asked him to back off his investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. I didnt say that, Trump said of the claim about Flynn. Asked at a Rose Garden news conference whether he would testify under oath to Mueller to that effect, Trump replied: 100 percent. He added, I would be glad to tell him exactly what I just told you. The Presidents response could signal that he is convinced he has done nothing wrong and that Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday is no more than a lie. Effectively, he was establishing a straight comparison between his word and Comeys on what went on in meetings and phone calls that made the former FBI chief so uncomfortable that he wrote down what happened. Alternatively, its possible that Trump may be calculating that there is no incriminating, objective proof about what occurred, leaving two irreconcilable versions of the same encounters. CNN presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said that in two recent parallel situations in which Presidents Bill Clinton and Richard Nixon were accused of wrongdoing, there was accompanying incontrovertible evidence. In Clintons case, there was Monica Lewinskys blue dress. In Watergate, you had the White House tapes. We dont have the smoking gun evidence at this juncture, Brinkley said. Significantly, Trump also used his appearance on Friday to deliver a broad hint that there are not, despite his earlier warning to Comey on Twitter, any tapes of their meetings and phone calls. If such tapes exist, they could provide corroboration of either Trumps comments or Comeys account of their meetings, which the former FBI chief detailed in memos he gave to the special counsel, and which may add credibility to his version of events. You are struggling to find a scenario that actually makes sense because it stretches the imagination. What the President has done is put himself in a very precarious position, CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said on New Day on Saturday.  A court of law and the court of public opinion is likely to give some weight to Comeys memos of what he saw and heard, Coates said. Comey testified on Thursday that he suddenly woke up in the middle of the night a few days after Trump tweeted that he better hope there were not tapes, with the same thought. Lordy, I hope there are tapes, Comey said at the hearing. Trumps aggressive strategy since the Comey hearing would be a rash one indeed if such tapes, which the law would require him to hand over to investigators, are stashed away somewhere in the White House. He told reporters on Friday that he would reveal if there are any tapes over a fairly short period of time. Then he added a teasing, cryptic comment that could indicate no such recordings exist.  Oh, youre going to be very disappointed when you hear the answer, dont worry, Trump told reporters. Still, Trumps approach represents a serious gamble, that could get him into deep legal and political waters if if backfires. For one thing, if he were to go under oath with Mueller, he would not know for sure what kind of evidence the special counsel would bring to the table. And depending on the conditions of the encounter, Trump might also open himself up to questioning on other issues, and risk saying something that may later turn out to be untrue and place himself in legal and political jeopardy. What was most interesting to me is his willingness to say I will say this under oath . .. that message is    we will take the he said, he said . .. and may the best, if you will, man win, Michael Zeldin, a former special assistant to Mueller when the special counsel headed the FBI, told CNNs Brooke Baldwin Friday. Comeys verbatim notes written after his meetings with Trump would likely put his evidence in a more credible light than Trumps, should the President not have a record of his own conversations, Zeldin said. If there is a tie, I think that helps tip the tie toward the Comey side, he said. Even so, it is questionable whether a   House of Representatives would move towards impeachment proceedings in a case simply based upon Comeys word against Trumps. That may be the reason why the President, even if he is not telling the entire truth about his meetings with Comey, believes it is unlikely he will ever have to pay up on the bet that he made Friday. And there is also no guarantee that Trump, despite saying he would testify before Mueller, will not change his mind about going under oath given the risks, or could be compelled to do so."
Trumps fantasy of vindication in Russia probe,CNN,Julian Zelizer,6/9/2017,"(CNN) President Donald Trump lives in the biggest political bubble of all. His disastrous last few weeks culminated with former FBI Director James Comey delivering stinging testimony about how the President leaned on him to stop a major investigation into the administration.  Testifying before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Comey expressed his strong feeling that the President is an inveterate liar who could not be trusted. President Trump ended his brief Twitter hiatus by saying: Despite so many false statements and lies, total and complete vindication . . . and WOW, Comey is a leaker! At his press conference Friday in the Rose Garden, Trump doubled down by saying: Yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction. Trump, who said he would testify under oath to deny Comeys claims about their conversation, added that the testimony was an excuse by Democrats who lost an election they shouldnt have lost. More fake news from President Trump. Trumps strident sense of confidence about his invulnerability in the expanding investigation is a result of the President being surrounded by weak yes men and women as well as being defended by a conservative media which spins every story his way. When he turns on the television, there is at least one pundit ready to repeat the talking points that his own White House puts out. Ironically, President Trumps skewed world view also gains support from disillusioned Democrats, still reeling from the election, who think of him like President Frank Underwood from House of Cards, the guy who gets away with everything. But just because a president says he is winning, that doesnt mean its true. The   controversy is taking an immense toll on the administration and on the Republican Party. One of the most revealing parts of James Comeys written testimony was the sense that in private, Trump seems to understand that the Russia investigation is a big problem, notwithstanding his endless bluster. He asked Comey to lift the cloud that hovers over the White House as a result of the investigation. Unless Comey is not telling the truth, and there is no evidence that this is the case, Trump is not being straight with his own supporters. The investigations have consumed his presidency and they are not going away any time in the near future. Trump  has zero major legislative accomplishments to speak of at this point. Every time there is even a little bit of momentum for legislation, such as the House passage of the health care bill or Trumps outline of a tax cut, more damaging information comes out of the Russia probe that distracts Congress from the business of making policy. The President himself appears paralyzed by the controversy and has devoted little attention to anything else. The tone of his furious tweets suggests that he is very focused on this story and angry about whats happening. Given where Republicans were in January 2017, enjoying the start of united   control of government and a devastated Democratic Party, the empty record is stunning. If approval ratings mean anything, the scandals have not helped President Trump whose numbers have been historically poor. A Quinnipiac poll recently found that 34% of voters approve of President Trump. Sixty eight percent said they were very concerned or somewhat concerned about his relationship with Russia, though only 31% believed he did something illegal. Quinnipiac is not an outlier. Most polls have confirmed that the public does not see President Trump as doing a good job and they are concerned about Russia. A majority has supported the appointment of a special counsel and an independent investigation.  Even more important, Nate Silver cites evidence that his support among the base is finally slipping. He shows how there has been a significant fall in the number of people who strongly approve of Trump     from 30% in February (the peak) to about 21% in May.  These numbers, combined with more evidence that the 2018 midterms could be a wave election that brings Democrats into power in both chambers, is certainly not a victory for the President, whose party is paying the costs of the chaos.    While most Republicans keep their heads buried in the sand, more nonpartisan officials are speaking up. Former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, hardly a fiery Democratic activist, said that Watergate pales in comparison to the current investigation into the Trump administration and Russia. Comey, who many Democrats feel handed Trump the presidential victory with his announcements about the Hillary Clinton email scandal, was unequivocal in his assessment that something is profoundly wrong in this White House. The actions of Sens. Richard Burr and Mark Warner provided some hope that the committee will be able to conduct a genuine investigation, while special counsel Robert Mueller is by all accounts a tough prosecutor who will do everything needed to get to the bottom of this story. It is important to remember that Watergate took a long time to gestate. The scandal started with the   to the Democratic National Headquarters in June 1972 and didnt end until President Nixon resigned in August 1974, facing impeachment. The famous smoking gun tape didnt come until the very end of the process, after Congress and prosecutors had slowly built a strong case and discovered what had taken place in Nixons broken White House. Today, in our breaking news culture, we expect everything to be resolved within days. Thats not how this works. Yet the controversy over Russia has already taken on rather significant proportions very early into this presidency. Comeys testimony was damning. He laid out the case for obstruction of justice, even if he said that was not for him to decide. He also offered a picture of a president who doesnt know the boundaries of power. Given where President Trump is in his term, and the damage the Republicans can easily face as a result of the Russia investigation, Trumps claim of victory shows that it is the President who is living in the bubble     his own imagination."
Japan passes historic law to allow beloved Emperor to abdicate,CNN,Juliet Perry,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Japans parliament has passed into law a historic bill that enables Emperor Akihito to become the first Japanese monarch to abdicate in 200 years.  Imperial law decrees that sitting emperors cannot resign from their posts, but the   bill permits the    to pass the Chrysanthemum Throne to Crown Prince Naruhito, the eldest of his three children.  RELATED: What happens if the Emperor steps down? The last emperor to abdicate was Emperor Kokaku in 1817 in the later part of the Edo Period, and the royal male line is unbroken, records show, for at least 14 centuries.   However, the conversation around the Emperors hope to step down (who cited concerns his advanced age might be affecting his ability to serve) has been dominated by the debate on the role women play in the worlds oldest hereditary monarchy.  Added to the abdication bill is a resolution that potentially questions whether women who marry outside the family have to rescind their royal rights.  Stepping down for love  Currently, imperial law also decrees that    unlike in Europe or Great Britain    any princess who marries a commoner must leave the family.  The latest case of Princess Mako, who last month revealed plans are underway for her to become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, once again drew the topic into the limelight. Mako is one of 14 women in a royal family of only 19 people.  In addition to Princess Mako, there are six other unmarried princesses who could lose their imperial status if they marry commoners, raising the possibility that the royal family will soon not have enough members to carry out its public duties. Under pressure from the more conservative quarters of his ruling LDP party, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe initially resisted a major push from the opposition to support a draft resolution that would open up discussions on whether female members of the family should be permitted to retain their imperial status after they marry. Conservatives maintain a change of this ilk could lead to the advent of female succession, unthinkable to some of Japans traditionalists. However, in a big concession to the Democratic Party (DP) Prime Minister Abe did allow the additional resolution to be attached to the abdication bill, paving the way for the creation of   branches of the family that could potentially take on a share of the royal duties. Succession crisis  I think the reason people raise questions as to why women have to leave the royal household when they get married is because Japan is facing a succession crisis, says Jeff Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan.  They have a shortage of male heirs.  Naruhito only has one daughter, Princess Aiko. Next in line to the throne is Naruhitos younger brother, Crown Prince Akishino, followed by Akishinos son, Prince Hisahito, who was born in 2006. His birth put a halt to the renewed debate at the time about the legitimacy of female succession. Kingston says people are once again beginning to think about the possibility, which would help ease the crisis. Opinion polls show the Japanese people are just fine with the idea of having an empress, he says, adding that really its only conservatives that oppose the idea.  In   days, the emperor was seen as divine, and the idea of a female sitting on the throne is still highly controversial in more traditional circles. However, there have been calls from politicians and academics to review this policy, especially in light of the male heir shortage.  But Japans ruling Liberal Democratic Party has remained   on the issue, firmly ruling out any discussion this time around on constitutional changes regarding the viability of potential empresses.  While Japan might slowly be coming around to the idea of imperial princesses who marry outside the family, after what it believes could be up to 2, 600 years of unbroken male rule, it doesnt appear as though there will be a woman on the Chrysanthemum Throne any time soon."
Trump meets the ultimate adversary in Comey,CNN,Maeve Reston,6/9/2017,"(CNN) In the political drama that Donald Trump has created in Washington, he could not have dreamed up a more formidable adversary than James Comey.  After the President fired his FBI director in early May, he dismissed Comey as a showboat, a grandstander and a nut job. He told Russian diplomats the next day that Comeys exit had relieved great pressure that he felt from the Russia investigation. He apparently assumed Comey would fade away into private life.  He was dead wrong.  Private citizen Comey emerged Thursday to crank up the heat on the Trump administration to white hot. Comey was a lucid and persuasive witness on the Presidents character who framed his testimony as a defense of the FBI and the institutions of government. Throughout Trumps campaign and his presidency, he has tweeted and uttered falsehoods without consequences. But before Thursday, the President had yet to be held to account for his statements by someone with the precision and authority of the former FBI director.  In damaging testimony that plainly outlined the pieces of a potential obstruction of justice inquiry, Comey directly challenged Trumps credibility by pitting it against his own. (Lordy, he said at one point, I hope there are tapes). The former FBI director repeatedly accused the    of lying, and explained the elaborate steps he had taken to bolster the veracity of his own account.  Trump, the supposed media and reality TV genius, won the presidency in part by dominating the 2016 news cycle and driving it in his direction. Comeys testimony about the Presidents apparent missteps was a stark reminder that Trump has now completely lost control of the conversation.  For nearly three hours, Comey proved himself to be a consummate inside player in this Washington drama, one with keen political instincts who was constantly thinking several steps ahead of the President    making moves to protect himself and the independence of the FBI, and even to advance the Russia investigation after Trump ejected him.  With bluntness that was, at times, breathtaking, Comey told senators that he decided to document his conversations with Trump in detailed, contemporaneous memos because I was honestly concerned that he might lie. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders dismissed Comeys testimony during an   briefing Thursday. I can definitely say the President is not a liar, and I think its frankly insulting that question would be asked, she said. Trumps personal attorney Marc Kasowitz said the President felt vindicated by Comeys assertion that told the President on several different occasions that he was not under investigation as part of any probe into Russian interference in the election. Kasowitz also said that the President never pressured Comey to drop the investigation of Flynn.  During his testimony, Comey described his surprise in his February 14 meeting when the President asked everyone to leave the room, including the Attorney General, before requesting that Comey lay off the investigation of his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn.  My impression was something big is about to happen, I need to remember every single word that is spoken, Comey said. He went on to document the conversation in an unclassified memo, so it would be accessible and available to those investigating the Russia matters.   Perhaps the clearest example of Comeys foresight was his reaction to Trumps threatening tweet on Friday, May 12, that Comey better hope that there are no tapes of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!  I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didnt dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversations, there might be a tape, Comey told senators. He asked a friend, a professor at Columbia Law School, to share the content of his memo with a reporter.   My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square, Comey said. I didnt do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel. (His prediction came true. A day after The New York Times reported on the Comey memo, the Justice Department appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation.)  Comey made it clear Thursday that he never felt the need to document his conversations with Presidents George W. Bush or Barack Obama. With Trump, he said, the nature of the person and the unusual circumstances in which he found himself led him to document everything.   I knew that there might come a day when I would need a record of what had happened, Comey said. Not just to defend myself, but to defend the FBI, and our integrity as an institution, and the independence of our investigative function.  We dont know what direction Muellers investigation will take or whether there will ever be any accusation of wrongdoing leveled at President Trump in connection with his administrations ties to Russia.  But in the long run, his success as President will be determined by whether he can maintain the trust of the American people and his fellow Republicans in Congress.  Comeys testimony on Thursday raised considerable questions about whether he deserves that trust. And the investigation is only just beginning."
"Two Hill committees seek Comey memos, tapes",CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/9/2017,"(CNN) House and Senate investigators fired off a series of requests after former FBI Director James Comeys testimony, seeking memos of his private discussions with President Donald Trump and any records the White House kept of their discussion    including audio recordings. The leaders of the House Russia investigation, Reps. Michael Conaway, a Texas Republican, and Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, sent a request Friday directly to Comey for copies of his memos. They sent a separate request to Trumps White House counsel, Don McGahn, for any record the White House had of their meetings.  The House requested Comey and the White House provide the records, including tapes if they exist, by June 23. The Senate judiciary committee, meanwhile, sent a request to Columbia University law professor Daniel Richman for Comeys memos. Richman confirmed Thursday that he was the friend Comey testified who had discussed the memos with the press.  The leaders of the Senate judiciarys probe sent Richman the request Thursday and asked he provide it by Friday. A source familiar with the matter said Richman has been in touch with Senate judiciary through special counsel Bob Muellers office, and that there will be movement after the weekend.  The matter will be addressed on Monday, the source says. Its unclear if that means that the memos will be turned over to Congress on Monday, and the source would not provide any more details. Four members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including Chairman Chuck Grassley and ranking Democrat Dianne Feinstein, had set a Friday deadline for Richman to respond after Comey testified that he gave the memo to him and asked him to anonymously disclose it to the media in an attempt to prompt the naming of a special counsel. The Senate committee sent a request for Comeys memos from the FBI on and a separate request to the White House for any records kept by Trump, on May 17. Comey testified Thursday that Trump asked him to drop an investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn and implied Trump may have become the subject of investigation himself for interfering in the FBIs work. Under oath Thursday, Comey repeatedly called Trump a liar. Trump responded Friday by saying Comey was a liar. Asked if he had taped their conversations, as he implied in a threatening tweet shortly after he fired Comey, Trump said he would reveal that answer soon. Lordy, I hope there are tapes, Comey said during his testimony Thursday. During a news conference Friday, Trump said hed have more information related to whether tapes exist at a later date. I am not hinting at anything, Trump said, twice declining to elaborate. I will tell you about it over a very short period of time."
Actress Glenne Headly dies at 62,CNN,Chloe Melas,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Glenne Headly passed away on Thursday night, a representative for the actress told CNN. The actress, best known for starring alongside Warren Beatty in Dick Tracy, was 62. She is survived by her husband Byron McCulloch and son Stirling. It is with deep sorrow that we confirm the passing of Glenne Headly, her reps said in a statement. We ask that her familys privacy be respected in this difficult time.  Headly, a native of Connecticut, got her start in theater and went on to star in several productions including Extremities alongside Susan Sarandon in 1982. Eventually, she made the transition to film and her breakout role is credited to Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, opposite Steve Martin and Michael Caine.  Headly went on to star in more than 25 films, including Mortal Thoughts, Mr. Hollands Opus and Sgt. Bilko. Headly earned two Emmy nominations for Lonesome Dove and Bastard Out of Carolina. She was in the middle of filming the Hulu series Future Man alongside Josh Hutcherson and Ed Begley Jr. before her death.  In 1982, she married John Malkovich they divorced in 1988. She then married McCulloch in 1993 and they had a son."
Donald Trump hasnt tweeted in a very long time,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Donald Trump is a big fan of Twitter. He sees it as a direct pipeline to supporters, an end run on the   fake news media. Which makes any extended period of time without a tweet from the President worth noting.  And we are in the midst of such a drought right now.  The last time Trump sent out a tweet was 8:17 a. m. on Wednesday. It said this: Getting ready to leave for Cincinnati, in the GREAT STATE of OHIO, to meet with ObamaCare victims and talk Healthcare  also Infrastructure! Between that moment and the time of this posting, roughly 37 hours have passed. That, according to calculations made by the one and only Philip Bump of the Washington Post, is the   Twitter outage for Trump since he announced his candidacy in June 2015. To pass the fourth longest drought, Trump will need to stay away from Twitter for 2, 312 minutes    38 total hours, or until 10:17 p. m. Thursday    which looks doable. To break his   longest tweet drought, according to Bump, Trump would need to not tweet until 6:14 a. m. tomorrow. Whats fascinating about the past droughts is that they almost always have corresponded with slow news moments. Trumps longest break from Twitter, for example, came over the 2016 Thanksgiving Day weekend    soon after he had been elected. The second longest was earlier that same month, the weekend after the election when Trump was, almost certainly, worn down from the   campaign. This last 37 hours is not at all like those past Trump Twitter deserts. The last day and a half has seen not only the release of former FBI Director James Comeys written testimony Wednesday documenting his relationship with the President but also Comeys hugely   testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday. If ever there was a time when you might expect Trump to take phone in hand and offer his own   this past 37 hours was it. And yet, nothing. Theories abound to explain it. The most common one is that someone took Trumps phone away, ensuring that he simply lacked the ability to tweet. I doubt it. Hes the President of the United States. Hes made clear    in the face of much criticism    that he isnt going to stop tweeting. Im not sure anyone is in a position to simply tell the President to stop doing something and have him actually listen. Then theres the argument that Trumps silence suggests he has now finally been made aware of the political    and legal    peril he is in, and that by tweeting he makes things worse, not better. Again, count me skeptical because Trump has never shied away from tweeting amid dicey legal and political circumstances before. (Remember that he called the Russia investigation the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!  in the immediate aftermath of Bob Muellers appointment as special counsel.) Or maybe Trumps staff, as they had hoped to do, successfully distracted the President over these past 37 hours    keeping him from thinking too much, and therefore tweeting too much about the situation. But how is that even possible given that we know Trump is an absolutely avid news consumer and there has been so much (and so much bad) Trump news over that period of time? The short answer is we dont know why Trump hasnt tweeted since 8:17 a. m. Wednesday. But with every passing minute of Trump Twitter silence, he edges closer to his own personal best (worst? ).  One other thing we know: Silence isnt Trumps natural state. So when the drought breaks    and it will break    look out."
Poll: Ossoff leads Handel 51-44 in Georgia,CNN,Eric Bradner,6/9/2017,"(CNN) Democrat Jon Ossoff has a 7 percentage point edge over Republican Karen Handel among likely voters in a closely watched special election for a Georgia House seat, a new poll released Friday shows.  Ossoff leads Handel 51% to 44% among likely voters in an Atlanta   poll conducted June   by Abt Associates.   The poll did not specify how many likely voters were included in the survey, but the figures have a   margin of error, and with 5% saying they are still undecided, Ossoffs advantage could close.  The poll shows Ossoff is picking off 13% of Republicans and 50% of independents in a district that historically has been reliably red    Newt Gingrich and, more recently, new Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price represented it. Handel, meanwhile, is drawing virtually no Democratic support.  Already, its the most expensive House race in history    with millions of dollars from party committees and super PACs flooding the Atlanta airwaves.  Ossoffs campaign has raised a staggering $23 million, including $15 million in the last two months, according to campaign finance documents filed Thursday. Handel raised $4 million in that same   period.  Republicans have spent about $12 million on the race, almost double what Democratic outside groups have spent. The biggest player has been the GOP super PAC Congressional Leadership Fund, which has topped $6 million on the race itself.  The contest for Georgias 6th District seat is one Democrats have targeted for months as their best chance to win a special election and deal President Donald Trump a major setback.  The district is reliably Republican    Price never came close to losing a race    but saw a marked shift in its presidential results. Mitt Romney bested   Barack Obama by more than 20 points in 2012, but Trump beat Hillary Clinton by just 1. 5 points in the district in 2016.  Its status as a diverse, highly educated, suburban district makes it the kind Democrats hope will be competitive in the 2018 midterms."
Abducted Chinese teachers reportedly killed by ISIS in Pakistan,CNN,Katie Hunt,6/9/2017,"(CNN) China has expressed grave concern over reports that ISIS has killed two Chinese teachers kidnapped in Pakistan.  The man and woman, said by Chinese media to be a couple, were kidnapped by armed men on May 24 from the city of Quetta, the capital of Pakistans Balochistan province, on May 24 on their way to teach a Chinese language class, a senior security officer told CNN last month. Amaq, a news agency affiliated with ISIS, said Thursday that Islamic State fighters had killed two Chinese teachers who were being held in the Mastung,  Balochistan. The group also released a video, which showed two bodies shot and bleeding on some grassy ground. China resolutely opposes all forms of kidnapping of civilians and opposes all forms of terrorism and extreme acts of violence, said Hua Chunying, the spokesperson for Chinas Foreign Ministry, in a statement on Friday. Pakistans Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it was working to confirm authenticity of the reports of killing of two Chinese nationals, kidnapped in Quetta.  The deaths underscore the risks of Chinas growing international reach and influence. The Global Times, a   tabloid, said that guarding Chinese nationals overseas had become a new and serious challenge for national security.  As Chinas international influence is growing, terrorist organizations target Chinese for ransom or just to create a sensation. Cases of Chinese being kidnapped have increased, the paper said in an editorial.  INTERACTIVE: Chinas new world order, Chinese nationals have settled in Pakistan in greater numbers since the announcement of a $46 billion investment plan known as the   Economic Corridor (CPEC) in 2015    part of Chinas One Belt One Road initiative.  Given Pakistans complex security situation, both sides need to study and formulate a more comprehensive security plan to fully cover Chinese in Pakistan, the Global Times added.  US: China may build military base in Pakistan, Rescue attempt, Hua said authorities had been trying to rescue the hostages.  Pakistans military said Thursday that its security forces conducted an operation from June 1 to 3 in Mastung, where it said it killed 12 terrorists with links to ISIS that had been hiding in caves but didnt mention the abducted Chinese teachers.   Balochistan is home to the Gwador Port Complex, a flagship project of the economic corridor, but has been plagued by violence by different militant groups including the Pakistani Taliban and a separatist movement.  Pakistan views CPEC, a combination of infrastructure projects ranging from road networks, a fiber optic cable project, railway lines, a   port, coal mines and solar farms, as a huge opportunity to develop its economy.   Pakistan is home to roughly 20, 000 Chinese, according to Mustafa Hyder, chief executive of the   Institute."
F-35 fighters grounded over oxygen problems,CNN,Ryan Browne,6/9/2017,"(CNN) An   fighter wing has been temporarily grounded after five incidents where pilots suffered from oxygen deprivation problems, but the planes are expected to be flying again on Saturday, the Air Force said Friday.  The 56th Fighter Wing at Luke Air Force Base in Arizona suspended all   flights Friday after the five pilots experienced   symptoms, Air Force spokesman Capt. Mark Graff said in a statement. The pilots all used their backup oxygen to land the planes safely. In order to synchronize operations and maintenance efforts toward safe flying operations we have canceled local   flying, said Brig. Gen. Brook Leonard, commander of the 56th Fighter Wing. The Air Force takes these physiological incidents seriously, and our focus is on the safety and   of our pilots. We are taking the necessary steps to find the root cause of these incidents. Graff said that the pause was taken not out of fear or out of danger, but out of an abundance of caution, and said the Air Force plans to resume operations on Saturday. There are 55   at Luke Air Force Base. Graff said that its still not clear what caused the oxygen incidents, but said that the pause was confined to Luke because no other incidents have been reported at any other Air Force bases since May 2. But the Luke   grounding is nevertheless the latest setback for the   a long delayed and   weapons program thats become the Pentagons most expensive in history. The Air Force grounded 10 of its   fighters last year due to insulation problems, and last month the Air Force announced it had resolved an ejection seat issue that had led to a weight restriction being imposed on pilots. The Lockheed     fighter jets were declared combat ready by the Air Force last year, and   have now deployed to Japan and Europe. The   is the Air Force variant of the Joint Strike Fighter: The   Marine Corps variant was declared combat ready in 2015, and the   Nary variant is supposed to be combat operational next year. President Donald Trump has taken a personal interest in the   program, slamming the costs as out of control and then getting involved in the Pentagons contract negotiations with Lockheed Martin. He took credit for generating $700 million in savings in the $8. 5 billion contract for the latest batch of   fighters. For military jets, oxygen deprivation has been a nagging problem. The Navys    fighter jet pilots experienced a rising rate of physiological episodes, Navy officials told Congress in March. Navy investigators had identified 382 cases, including 130 that involved some form of oxygen contamination, and 114 with a failure of the jets system that maintains cabin pressure. The Air Forces   fighter pilots also struggled with   symptoms back in 2012, which led to limitations on   flights until the issue was resolved. The Air Force said Friday that the   program office has created a team of engineers, maintainers and aeromedical specialists to examine the incidents to better understand the issue."
Russell Moore Cant Support Either Candidate - The New York Times,New York Times,Ana Marie Cox,6/8/2017,"You have a somewhat different approach than your predecessors at the Southern Baptist Convention. Your tenure has been marked by your advocacy for working with others with whom you can find common cause, particularly in regard to racial reconciliation, which you worked with Obama on. What influenced you to break the tradition? Growing up in Mississippi shaped my life in all sorts of ways, including seeing a Bible Belt, cultural Christianity that was often very tolerant of racism and bigotry. Much of the New Testament has to do with breaking down divisions. As time has gone on, the more I see my identity within the global church and the global body of Christ, so what hurts my   brother or sister hurts me. Do you endorse the concept that black lives matter? Yes. I dont necessarily endorse everything that any institution or organization by that name might endorse, but I certainly endorse the concept that black lives matter. Have you had much luck, professionally and personally, changing your coreligionists minds on this kind of thing? Yes, actually. The Bible speaks so directly to these issues that, really, in order to avoid questions of racial unity, one has to evade the Bible itself. One of the problems we have on the race issue is that so few churches talk about it at all. Increasingly, I hear congregations starting to ask, How do we change so that our churches actually reflect the kingdom of God? Youve been an advocate for the church to be involved in issues that have some crossover across party lines:   reform, racial reconciliation, immigration. That, combined with #NeverTrump, has created bipartisan collaboration in a way I havent seen before. Do you think that will continue after the election? I hope so. One of the places of common ground that Ive found between people on the right and the left is a common commiserating about how bad both of these candidates are. If we can move past the sense that our identity is bound up in our political party or our political ideology, that will be a step forward. Very early in the campaign season, you said that evangelicals shouldnt support Trump for president. At first, it seemed as if he might not win them over, but now they seem to have come on board. Do you have an explanation for that? Part of the explanation is the recent alliance between the Republican Party and American evangelicalism. I think many evangelicals believe that they face a binary choice and they have no option but to support one of the two. When I talk to   evangelicals, the Supreme Court is the primary concern for them. Do you find their arguments personally persuasive? No, but I understand why people across the religious and political spectrum would conclude that they have to wrestle with their consciences and vote for one of these candidates. Im       reconciliation,   and   in office, so no matter what happens in November, I lose. Between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, which one do you think you might find more common cause with if he or she were elected? I dont know. I think that it would vary from issue to issue. Its been a fairly contentless election or at least a shifting kaleidoscope of content, and so I have no way to predict. I could pretty safely predict to you that Hillary Clinton is going to be working on   reform and sentence reform, sex trafficking, racial reconciliation. We could go down a menu of issues you might potentially be invited to the White House to talk about with her. Name something you could find common cause on with Donald Trump. I dont know where the points of commonality would be because I dont actually know where he would stand in office. But I agree with him on Mike Pence and La Guardia Airport, for sure."
EXCLUSIVE  Islamic State Supporters: Soon Well Attack the Snakes Head and Destroy Iran,Breitbart,Aaron Klein and Ali Waked,6/8/2017,"Writing in an encrypted chat room, Islamic State sympathizers and militants celebrated the deadly attacks on the parliament building in Iran and the tomb of the countrys Shiite revolutionary founder. [Breitbart Jerusalem obtained access to correspondence posted in a closed chat group that utilizes the encrypted Telegram messaging service. The group serves as an internal Twitter of sorts for IS jihadists and sympathizers, and has been used in the past to issue IS communications.  IS claimed responsibility for the attacks on Iran, which took place during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and appeared orchestrated in a manner to cause maximum civilian casualties. Writing in the encrypted Telegram group, IS member Abou Obaida Alsameraii exclaimed, We thank Allah, ask his forgiveness and thank him for facilitating our attack and our hits. We are counting on Allah as we strike Allahs enemies. This is a land of heresy, a capital of impurity, prostitution and profanity called Tehran. Today we attacked them in the depths of their land. We wont let them only attack us. We did this to defend our Sunni nation and we are punishing our enemies. Today we attacked their parliament, attacked their temple and their cemeteries and soon well attack the snakes head and destroy Iran with the help of Allah.  Another Telegram member who goes by the name Prince of the Jihad and Death as a Martyr wrote, May your jihad be blessed and may your fight be blessed, you lions of the Islamic State, princes of jihad and those who die as martyrs. Today our brothers, with their bodies, struck and attacked the heretic capital of Tehran. With their blood, theyve written a chapter in history, a new history. What was before todays attack will never be the same. This is a new era and a new stage in which we will witness more hits from our brothers against the countries of heresy.  Abi Abdullah Aljazrawi wrote, Allah is great, Allah is great, Allah is great. Thanks to Allah. We worship Allah to thank him for causing the infidels and criminals to taste the attacks of our brothers. We swear to Allah that we will break them yet, that there will be more of these. We say to them, there will yet be soldiers who shake their lands. We swear to Allah that they will see the strength of our brothers, the mujahedeen. They will see what their mercenaries in Iraq and Syria have not yet seen. We will shake their lands.  Abi Dajana Alhomsi wrote, Allah is great. We strike in Syria, Iraq and infidel countries in Europe and those who stand at the head of American terror and today we strike the heresy of Iran as we struck not so long ago in Saudi Arabia and against the supporters of the Gulf states of prostitution. We swear to Allah that the country of Caliphs will spread in spite of the opposition. This will be a Caliphate in the way of the prophet, a Caliphate that does not compromise with the enemy or give mercy to evil. We swear to Allah that we will show them the strength of our mujahedeen, they will see power that they have never realized.  Abi Rahman Aljazrawi wrote, They accused our country and our Caliphate of being agents of Saudi Arabia, America and Iran. Everyday we prove to everyone that we are walking the path of the prophet. We are the agents of Islam and all these bastards have no value according to our religion as long as they do not return to the righteous path and as long as the Christians do not pay, with submission, the poll tax. We swear to Allah that we go with justice and Allah is the one supporting us and will bring us victory. You would love for us to be your agents and supporters. We are soldiers of Allah on Earth and we will tear up your roots and return to Islam."

President Trumps Lawyer: Leaker Comey Retaliatory in Unauthorized Disclosures to Press of Privileged Communications with the President,Breitbart,Michelle Moons,6/8/2017,"WASHINGTON, D. C.     President Donald Trumps personal attorney Marc Kasowitz accused former FBI Director James Comey, in response to Comeys Thursday testimony on Capitol Hill, of retaliating against Trump by leaking privileged communications with the President to the press. [Kasowitz made a statement in response to Comeys testimony in the congressional hearing, a portion of which reads:        it is overwhelmingly clear that there have been and continue to be those in government who are actively attempting to undermine this administration with selective and illegal leaks of classified information and privileged communications. Mr. Comey has now admitted that he is one of these leakers. Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he unilaterally and surreptitiously made unauthorized disclosures to the press of privileged communications with the President. The leaks of this privileged information began no later than March 2017 when friends of Mr. Comey have stated that he disclosed to them the conversations that he had with the President during their January 27, 2017 dinner and February 14, 2017 White House meeting. Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he leaked to friends of his, purported memos of those privileged conversations, one of which he testified, was classified. Mr. Comey also testified that immediately after he was terminated he authorized his friends to leak the contents of those memos to the press in order to, in Mr. Comeys words, prompt the appointment of a special counsel.  Although Mr. Comey testified that he only leaked the memos in response to a tweet, the public record reveals that the New York Times was quoting from those memos the day before the referenced tweet, which belies Mr. Comeys excuse for this unauthorized disclosure of privileged information and appears to be entirely retaliatory. We will leave it to the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all the others that are being investigated. In some, it is now established that the President was not being investigated for colluding with or attempting to obstruct any investigation. As the committee pointed out today, these important facts for the country to know are virtually the only facts that have not been leaked during the course of these events. As he said yesterday, the President feels completely vindicated and is eager to continue moving forward with his agenda, with the business of this country and with this public cloud removed. Thank you. Comey testified before congress on Thursday, admitting that he leaked information to friends and gave them permission to leak that information to the press.

Lindsey Graham: Half of what Trump does is not OK,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/8/2017,"Washington (CNN) Sen. Lindsey Graham, a frequent critic of President Donald Trump, said Thursday that many of the Presidents actions are troubling    but that does not make them criminal. The South Carolina Republican told CBSs Gayle King that it was inappropriate for Trump to tell James Comey that he needed his loyalty over dinner, as the former FBI director alleged in testimony released Wednesday. Half of what Trump does is not OK, he said Thursday on This Morning. If you are trying to convict him for being a bull in a China shop, crude and rude, youd win. A lot of this stuff troubles me, but it is not a crime, Graham added.  Graham said Wednesday that Comeys opening statement for his hearing at the Senate intelligence committee shows there is no obstruction of justice case against Trump. What prosecutor in their right mind would allow their star witness to go out before the Senate panel of 20 senators and get beat up if he really believed he had a case? he asked in an interview with Fox News. This is the best evidence yet that in the mind of the special counsel, there is no obstruction of justice case to be made against President Trump. All in all, its a pretty good day for President Trump. Despite Grahams optimism, Comeys statement is sure to spark many questions. The ousted FBI director wrote that Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty. Comey also alleges that the President asked him to stop investigating   security adviser Michael Flynn and to publicly declare that Trump was not under investigation. Comey has now told us all that the President is not under investigation as an individual for colluding with Russia, Graham said. President Trump is not a target or subject to a criminal investigation or counterintelligence investigation regarding colluding with the Russians."
Paul Ryan: Trump asking for Comeys loyalty obviously inappropriate,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/8/2017,"Washington (CNN) House Speaker Paul Ryan said its obviously inappropriate for President Donald Trump to have asked ousted FBI Director James Comey to pledge his loyalty. When asked by MSNBCs Greta Van Susteren on Wednesday whether the request was appropriate, the Wisconsin Republican answered: I mean, obviously I dont think that is. I think Director Comey will probably get a lot of questions about that tomorrow, will be my guess.  Ryan was responding to claims made by Comey in his opening statement, which was released one day ahead of his appearance before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday.  In it, the former FBI official    who was leading the probe into Russias meddling into the 2016 election    wrote that Trump told him I expect loyalty. Comey said the President also asked him to stop investigating former national security adviser Michael Flynn, and publicly declare that Trump was not under investigation. FBI directors are supposed to be independent, Ryan said of the   interactions. Thats something thats very, very critical. Trump announced on Twitter his plans to nominate Christopher A. Wray, the former assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Departments criminal division, to be the next FBI director. Wray . .. seems to fit the bill for an independent prosecutor career professional type, Ryan said. Because we typically look for someone who is going to be independent, but also that that position is treated independently. The Republican lawmaker added that its clear Russia meddled in the US election.  What we need to determine is not whether they did it    we know that, Ryan said. Its what did they do, how did they do it, how do we prevent it from happening again? And then how do we help our allies so that this doesnt happen to them?"
RNC: Trumps firing of Comey was the right thing to do,CNN,Sara Murray,6/8/2017,"Washington (CNN) As James Comey testifies on Capitol Hill Thursday, President Donald Trumps allies are prepared to cast his decision to fire the former FBI director as a selfless move that he made for the good of the country.   President Trump knew firing Comey would be detrimental to his presidency, but he knew it was the right thing to do for the country, so he did it anyways, according to a set of talking points the Republican National Committee is providing to  . While the RNCs decision to   for the White House on a rapid response effort and communications strategy is an unusual one in some respects, its an easy fit in others. Reince Priebus, Trumps chief of staff, previously served as chairman of the RNC, where he oversaw the build out of the committees research effort and communications team. And former White House staffers are pitching in. Mike Dubke    who recently resigned from his role as White House communications director    played a part in organizing the Comey response effort. He was spotted at the RNC Wednesday walking staffers through the plans for Thursdays testimony. By relying on the RNC, a   White House staff stands to reap the benefits of the partys existing network of surrogates, state parties and elected officials to help defend Trump ahead of the outsized coverage anticipated around the Comey testimony, the RNC official said. Its an apparatus the Republican Party has deployed to try to help Trump execute on other priorities, such as building a drumbeat of grassroots support in favor of his nomination of Neil Gorsuch for the Supreme Court. Our bullhorn, if you will, is a very large and helpful tool in getting this message out, the senior RNC official said. The RNC has already begun briefing its state parties, members of Congress and surrogates in preparation for Thursdays hearing. Their primary arguments echo those of Trumps personal lawyer    that the President feels vindicated by the written testimony, in which Comey acknowledged that he told Trump he was not personally under investigation. The Presidents allies had been prepared to say that Trump never asked Comey to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn or anyone else. But they backed off that plan after Comeys written testimony    which clearly contradicted that narrative    was released, according to someone familiar with the plan. But the RNC is also prepping   to argue there is no evidence of collusion or obstruction of justice. One talking point notes: The testimony also confirms that President Trump did not impede or engage in obstruction of justice of the investigation. Trumps allies are expected to take aim at the press as well. The Left and the media are using the Russia investigation as a means to obstruct the Presidents agenda. It is time to get back to the real issues, according to the talking points. Also in the RNCs crosshairs    the Democrats    who, according to the GOP talking points have been tripping over themselves on the issue of whether Comey deserved to be fired. But one of the more questionable talking points could be the notion that Trumps decision to fire Comey    who was at the helm of the Russia investigation that had the President fuming    was borne out of patriotism. The President made this decision in the best interest of the country, period, a senior RNC official said. He knew it would make it harder on himself, and he didnt sway from that decision. Well continue to push that narrative. Its a different narrative than the one the White House shopped around in the wake of Comeys firing. In the immediate aftermath, White House officials said they expected both Democrats and Republicans to welcome the move and were even caught by surprise at the backlash Trump was facing. The RNCs effort comes amid   jostling over how to create an organization to defend the President ahead of Comeys testimony. Attempts to set up a war room that would have functioned with a combination of White House staffers and outside advisers stalled, as Trumps team was preoccupied with building out its legal team. The RNCs job is to defend and promote the President, the senior RNC official said. Its a political role that the RNC is built to play. For now, the strategy hinges on talking points and surrogates rather than any paid media efforts, the official said. It remains unclear whether the RNC will permanently take up the Trump defender mantle on issues surrounding the Russia probe. One GOP official said the situation is still fluid. But it appears to be a welcome assist for White House staffers, bogged down by questions about Russia. By Wednesday afternoon, the White House press shop was pointing reporters to RNC statements rather than anything originating from the West Wing. But perhaps the biggest risk to the RNCs approach is the   President, who can undermine the most carefully crafted communications strategy in 140 characters or less."
Is D.N.C. Email Hacker a Person or a Russian Front? Experts Arent Sure - The New York Times,New York Times,Charlie Savage and Nicole Perlroth,6/8/2017,"WASHINGTON     Who is Guccifer 2. 0, the   Romanian lone hacker responsible for copying thousands of emails and other files from the Democratic National Committee     a real person, or a front created by Russian intelligence officials? Technology specialists have been debating that question since June 15, when CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm hired by the Democratic National Committee, announced that sophisticated hacker groups with Russian links were responsible for breaching the committees computer servers. Within hours of the announcement, someone using the moniker Guccifer 2. 0 started a blog to mock that finding, posting several of the stolen documents and claiming sole credit. But the publication by WikiLeaks of an archive of the committees internal emails     and the uproar they caused on the eve of the Democratic National Convention     have focused wider attention on who, or what, is operating behind that name. While WikiLeaks has not said how it obtained the emails, Guccifer 2. 0 claimed in a blog post last month to have sent them to WikiLeaks. Cybersecurity specialists have pointed to an array of forensic and technical evidence suggesting that Guccifer 2. 0 might not be a Romanian as claimed. That evidence included metadata hidden in the early documents indicating that they were edited on a computer with Russian language settings. American intelligence officials believe that Guccifer 2. 0 is a front for the G. R. U. Russias military intelligence service, according to federal officials briefed on the investigation. In blog posts, Twitter messages, and electronic chats with journalists, Guccifer 2. 0 has insisted such skeptics are wrong. Against that backdrop, Guccifer 2. 0s words are taking on heightened interest. They may be clues to a persons decision to intervene in the American election, or they may be a case study of a   Russian information campaign     the work of different intelligence officials, crowded around a keyboard. Just because the Wizard of Oz says hes a wizard doesnt actually mean he is, said Peter Singer, a security strategist at the New America Foundation, a public policy institute. The original Guccifer (pronounced  ) is a real person: Marcel Lazar Lehel, a Romanian hacker who used the pseudonym Guccifer to hack various accounts belonging to American celebrities and government officials, including members of the Bush family, former Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, and Sidney Blumenthal, an informal adviser to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Lehel was arrested in Romania in 2014 for hacking the email accounts of several Romanian officials. In April, he was extradited to the United States to face hacking charges and pleaded guilty in May before a federal judge in Alexandria, Va. While awaiting sentencing, Mr. Lehel claimed to have hacked Mrs. Clintons private email server, but federal officials have found no evidence to support his claim. Mr. Lehel is known for his fixation on what conspiracy theorists call the Illuminati, a shadowy group that they believe controls the world. The first Guccifer 2. 0 blog post, and messages Guccifer 2. 0 sent along with packages of files that same day to the websites Gawker and The Smoking Gun, also denounced the Illuminati. Other oddities also arose. Technical specialists, scouring metadata on documents posted to Guccifer 2. 0s blog, found some that were last marked by a person with a user name in Cyrillic that appeared to be a nod to Felix E. Dzerzhinsky, best known for establishing the early Soviet secret police forces. On June 21, Motherboard, an online technology magazine, posted a Twitter chat log of an interview with Guccifer 2. 0, in which the person using that account claimed to be Romanian and denied working with the Russian government. Pressed on why Russian language markings showed up in the metadata of the documents he had sent out, Guccifer 2. 0 claimed that was just a watermark.  I dont like Russians and their foreign policy. I hate being attributed to Russia, Guccifer 2. 0 wrote. During the interview, Motherboard switched from using English to Romanian and to Russian. Guccifer 2. 0 claimed not to speak Russian and abruptly cut off the interview. Motherboard later reported findings of linguistics specialists who said that his Romanian answers did not seem like those of a native speaker, and that the syntax of several of his English lines echoed Russian sentence constructions. And a linguistic analysis provided to The New York Times by Shlomo Argamon, a chief scientist at Taia Global, a cybersecurity firm that has questioned cyberattack attribution claims in the past, also concluded that Guccifer 2 is Russian. Mr. Argamon, who is a professor of computer science and the director of the master of data science program at the Illinois Institute of Technology, found seven oddities in the hackers English text, five of which pointed clearly to Russian as the speakers native tongue. The linguistic evidence consistently points towards the writer being either a native Russian speaker, Mr. Argamon said. It is possible that the writer is a Romanian speaker who has studied Russian. However, the writer denied knowing any Russian, and so the most reasonable conclusion is that he is a Russian native speaker rather than a Romanian native speaker.  On June 30, Guccifer 2. 0 posted additional documents from the Democratic National Committees servers on the WordPress blog. The post again denied Russian links, and spoke admiringly of Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks Edward J. Snowden, the former intelligence analyst who leaked archives of surveillance documents and Chelsea Manning, the Army private who sent a huge trove of military and diplomatic documents to WikiLeaks in 2010. That post accused Mrs. Clinton of being bought and sold, in contrast to Mr. Trump, who it said has earned his money himself. And at least he is sincere in what he says.  But the post still expressed opposition to Mr. Trumps ideas about closing borders and deportation policy.  Of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the post said, He never had a chance to win the nomination as the Democratic Party itself stood against him! The Hill, a newspaper that covers Congress, reported on July 13 that Guccifer 2. 0 had reached out to it and had provided documents about Democratic campaign donors and lobbyists. It quoted Guccifer 2. 0 as saying in an electronic chat, The press [is] gradually forget[ing] about me, [W]ikileaks is playing for time and [I] have some more docs.  The next day, Guccifer 2. 0 posted those documents on the blog. That was the last blog posting. The Guccifer 2. 0 Twitter account posted a few more messages. The most recent one, on July 22, expressed excitement that WikiLeaks had posted the archive of nearly 20, 000 Democratic committee emails that Id given them! !! Since then, that account has fallen silent, too. No messages were posted even as the Democratic Party chairwoman, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz, resigned and Mrs. Clintons campaign manager accused the Russian government of providing the leaked emails to WikiLeaks to help Mr. Trump."
"D.N.C. Says Russian Hackers Penetrated Its Files, Including Dossier on Donald Trump - The New York Times",New York Times,David E. Sanger and Nick Corasaniti,6/8/2017,"WASHINGTON     Two groups of Russian hackers, working for competing government intelligence agencies, penetrated computer systems of the Democratic National Committee and gained access to emails, chats and a trove of opposition research against Donald J. Trump, according to the party and a cybersecurity firm. One group placed espionage software on the committees computer servers last summer, giving it unimpeded access to communications for about a year. The committee called in CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity firm, early last month after the Democratic Party began to suspect an intrusion. A senior government official said Hillary Clintons presidential campaign, based in Brooklyn, also appeared to have been targeted, but it was not clear whether it lost any data. The breach at the Democratic committee was first reported on Tuesday by The Washington Post. The committees systems appeared to have had standard cyberprotections, which are no challenge for determined   hacking groups. The attackers were expelled last weekend with CrowdStrikes help, the committee said. It did not provide a detailed account of what had been copied from the systems, and it may never know. The connection to Russia may be explained simply by the global fascination with the presidential campaign and the mystery surrounding Mr. Trump, who has not been a major subject of foreign intelligence collection. But it also recalls a subplot to the race: Paul Manafort, Mr. Trumps campaign chairman, previously advised   politicians in Ukraine and other parts of Eastern Europe, including former President Viktor F. Yanukovych of Ukraine. Opposition research itself is not all that valuable to a foreign government, but it can point to a candidates vulnerabilities. To a foreign government fascinated by an American election, any intelligence a campaign develops on an opponent could be exploited. Dmitri Alperovitch, a   of CrowdStrike, said he believed that the group that first hacked the committees servers     a group his firm had named Cozy Bear long before the breach     appeared to be the same that downloaded communications in recent years from unclassified email systems used by the State Department and the White House. In 2014 and 2015, the effort to clean the State Department systems after those intrusions resulted in several shutdowns, some in the midst of delicate negotiations with Iran. The administration has never confirmed that the Russian government was behind those intrusions, but it has briefed officials on the details in classified sessions. These are incredibly sophisticated groups, Mr. Alperovitch said. They covered their tracks well. It wasnt until the second group came in, stealing the opposition research on Mr. Trump, that their presence was detected.  The second group, named Fancy Bear, which appeared to have attacked in April, is believed to be operated by the G. R. U. the military intelligence service. Its past targets have included military and aerospace organizations from the United States, Europe, Canada, Japan and South Korea. CrowdStrike concluded that neither Russian group knew the other was attacking the same organization. One would steal a password, and the next day the other group would steal the same password, Mr. Alperovitch said. Mrs. Clinton said on Telemundo that she had learned of the breach only after news outlets reported it. She called it troubling, but said she was unsure about the hackers goals. Now, why? she asked. We dont know yet. So far as we know, my campaign has not been hacked into, and were obviously looking hard at that. But cybersecurity will be an issue that I will be absolutely focused on as president. Because whether its Russia, or China, Iran or North Korea, more and more countries are using hacking to steal our information, to use it to their advantage, and we cant let that go on.  The Office of Personnel Management, whose files on about 22 million Americans with security clearances or applications for them were breached by Chinese hackers, is still trying to assess the damage first detected last year. The Democratic committee avoided any discussion of its vulnerabilities. The security of our system is critical to our operation and to the confidence of the campaigns and state parties we work with, said Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic national chairwoman. When we discovered the intrusion, we treated this like the serious incident it is and reached out to CrowdStrike immediately. Our team moved as quickly as possible to kick out the intruders and secure our network.  The party did not say how it came to suspect the intrusion. Cyberattacks by foreign governments are a constant threat to political campaigns. Because campaign operations are temporary, they often do not invest heavily in the kind of security that financial institutions, large companies and government agencies spend millions or billions of dollars on each year. And because campaigns are so   with volunteers connecting through laptops and cellphones, they are particularly vulnerable. In 2008, hackers traced to the Chinese government infiltrated the campaigns of both Barack Obama and John McCain. It should come as no surprise to anyone that political parties are   targets for foreign intelligence gathering, Representative Jim Langevin, a Rhode Island Democrat who has been deeply involved in cyberissues, said in a statement. Nonetheless, it is disconcerting that two independent operations were able to penetrate the D. N. C. one of which was able to stay embedded for nearly a year."
Spy Agency Consensus Grows That Russia Hacked D.N.C. - The New York Times,New York Times,David E. Sanger and Eric Schmitt,6/8/2017,"WASHINGTON     American intelligence agencies have told the White House they now have high confidence that the Russian government was behind the theft of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee, according to federal officials who have been briefed on the evidence. But intelligence officials have cautioned that they are uncertain whether the electronic   at the committees computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage     of the kind the United States also conducts around the world     or as part of an effort to manipulate the 2016 presidential election. The emails were released by WikiLeaks, whose founder, Julian Assange, has made it clear that he hoped to harm Hillary Clintons chances of winning the presidency. It is unclear how the documents made their way to the group. But a large sampling was published before the WikiLeaks release by several news organizations and someone who called himself Guccifer 2. 0, who investigators now believe was an agent of the G. R. U. Russias military intelligence service. The assessment by the intelligence community of Russian involvement in the D. N. C. hacking, which largely echoes the findings of private cybersecurity firms that have examined the electronic fingerprints left by the intruders, leaves President Obama and his national security aides with a difficult diplomatic and political decision: whether to publicly accuse the government of President Vladimir V. Putin of engineering the hacking. Such a public accusation could result in a further deterioration of the already icy relationship between Washington and Moscow, at a moment when the administration is trying to reach an accord with Mr. Putin on a   in Syria and on other issues. It could also doom any effort to reach some kind of agreement about acceptable behavior in cyberspace, of the kind the United States has been discussing with China. In an interview with Savannah Guthrie of NBC News on Tuesday, President Obama stopped short of accusing the Russian agencies from seeking to manipulate the election but said, Anythings possible.  He noted that on a regular basis, they try to influence elections in Europe.  Stealing information about another countrys political infighting is hardly new, and the United States has conducted covert collection from allies like Germany and adversaries like Russia for decades. Publishing the documents     what some have called weaponizing them     is a different issue. Mrs. Clintons campaign has suggested that Mr. Putin was trying to even the score after the former secretary of state denounced a 2011 Russian election as filled with fraud. The first thing that the secretary of state did was say that they were not honest and not fair, but she had not even yet received the material from the observers, Mr. Putin said at the time. She set the tone for some actors in our country and gave them a signal, Mr. Putin continued. They heard the signal and, with the support of the U. S. State Department, began active work.  Campaign officials have also suggested that Mr. Putin could be trying to tilt the election to Donald J. Trump. But they acknowledge that they have no evidence. Asked on Tuesday at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia whether theres more to the   relationship that hasnt come out, John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman, said, Well, he certainly has a bromance with Mr. Putin, so I dont know.  Mr. Podesta said that while Russia had a history of interfering in democratic elections in Europe, it would be unprecedented in the United States.  The Republican platform, adopted last week in Cleveland, calls on the United States to respond in kind and in greater magnitude to cyberattacks. Russia and China see cyber operations as part of a warfare strategy during peacetime, it says. Our response should be to cause diplomatic, financial and legal pain.  But the Trump campaign has dismissed the accusations about Russia as a deliberate distraction, meant to draw attention away from the content of nearly 20, 000 emails and documents from the Democratic committee that WikiLeaks started releasing on Friday. They showed efforts to impugn Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont in his effort to challenge Mrs. Clinton for the nomination. On Twitter Tuesday night, Mr. Trump said that in order to deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, Democrats were saying: Russia is dealing with Trump. Crazy! For the record, he said, I have ZERO investments in Russia.  Mr. Obama, in his interview with NBC News, criticized Mr. Trump for suggesting last week that the United States should not defend from Russian aggression any country that does not contribute sufficient funds to NATO. He said Mr. Trump was undermining the countrys   War II alliances in Europe. Secretary of State John Kerry raised the cyberattack with his Russian counterpart, Sergey V. Lavrov, on Tuesday at a meeting of foreign ministers in Vientiane, Laos. Mr. Lavrov dismissed the idea that Russia was involved, telling reporters who asked about the charges: I dont want to use   words.  Mr. Kerry made no accusations, saying he had to allow the F. B. I. to do its work before he drew any conclusions in terms of what happened or whos behind it.  The federal investigation, involving the F. B. I. and the intelligence agencies, has been going on since the Democratic National Committee first called in a private cybersecurity firm, Crowdstrike, in April. Preliminary conclusions were discussed on Thursday at a weekly cyberintelligence meeting for senior officials. The Crowdstrike report, supported by several other firms that have examined the same bits of code and telltale metadata left on documents that were released before WikiLeaks publication of the larger trove, concludes that the Federal Security Service, known as the F. S. B. entered the committees networks last summer. The G. R. U. a competing, military intelligence unit, was a later arrival. Investigators believe it is the G. R. U. that has played a bigger role in releasing the emails. In an essay published on Lawfare, a blog that often deals with cyberissues, Susan Hennessey, previously a lawyer for the National Security Agency, called the published evidence about Russian involvement about as close to a smoking gun as can be expected when a sophisticated   is involved.  Mr. Assanges threat to release documents, she wrote, means, put simply, that actors outside the U. S. are using criminal means to influence the outcome of a US election. Thats a problem.  But American intelligence agencies have their doubts that the Russian intention, at least initially, was to sway the American election. The intrusion began just shortly after Mr. Trump announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination. At the time, his chances looked minuscule. One senior official noted that while the cyberattack might have been intended to embarrass Mrs. Clinton, who was the presumptive nominee, it could not have been aimed at bolstering Mr. Trump. It is far from clear that Mr. Obama or the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey, would ever name Russia as the origin of the hack. Mr. Obama has only once accused a country of attacking an American organization, when he said North Korea was the source of the 2014 attack against Sony Pictures Entertainment. But the United States has no relationship with North Korea, and there was little to lose from identifying it. In the case of Russia and China     countries with which the United States has complex relationships     Mr. Obama has in the past made the opposite decision. He never named the Russian intelligence agencies as the perpetrators of hacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems, or on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. While the administration has called out the Peoples Liberation Army of China for stealing intellectual property     even indicting officers of its   Unit 61398     it never publicly accused the Chinese intelligence services of stealing the   files on more than 21 million Americans who held or applied for clearances. By happenstance, the intelligence report on the Democratic National Committee hacking was circulating here the day that Mr. Obama issued a new policy, long in development, to organize the governments response to major cyberattacks and to set up a   grading system to assess the severity of strikes against American companies, government agencies and organizations. The action against the Democratic committee, they said, would qualify as a significant cyber incident, which was defined as one that causes demonstrable harm to the national security interests, foreign relations or economy of the United States, or to the public confidence, civil liberties or public health and safety of the American people.  Ranking the hacking in the pantheon of other penetrated networks is difficult. The top ranking under Mr. Obamas system would be reserved for an attack that disabled American power grids, for example, akin to the suspected Russian attack on Ukraines electrical system in December. The attack on the Office of Personnel Management and Sony, which destroyed 70 percent of the studios computers, would also rank above the category 3 level, which defines a significant attack. But the ranking system does not mandate what kind of response the president would authorize. And it was designed before many in Washington imagined the use of cyberattacks to release information in the midst of a dizzying, and volatile, presidential campaign."
Hacker Releases More Democratic Party Documents - The New York Times,New York Times,Eric Lichtblau and Noah Weiland,6/8/2017,"WASHINGTON     A hacker believed to be tied to the Russian intelligence services made public another set of internal Democratic Party documents on Friday, including the personal cellphone numbers and email addresses of nearly 200 lawmakers. The files appeared to be less politically embarrassing and damaging than the hackers initial trove, which came from the Democratic National Committee. Those documents, released by WikiLeaks last month on the eve of the partys convention, led to the resignation of the committees leader, Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz. But the emergence of another set of leaked documents threatened to intensify international tensions over Russias suspected meddling in United States politics. The hacker claiming responsibility for the breach     working under the pseudonym Guccifer 2. 0, which American intelligence officials believe is an alias for a Russian intelligence hacker     appeared eager to taunt Democrats in releasing the latest files. Those documents came from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the   arm for House Democrats. Its time for new revelations now, the hacker wrote in posting the files. All of you may have heard about the DCCC hack. As you see I wasnt wasting my time! It was even easier than in the case of the DNC breach.  On Friday night, the hacker indicated that more leaks would follow, writing on Twitter that the major trove of the House committee documents would be sent to WikiLeaks. Keep following, the hacker wrote. While it became known last month that the House committee had been hacked along with the D. N. C. this was the first time its files had become public. In a statement, the House committee said it was investigating the authenticity of the documents and was working with federal law enforcement officials. The F. B. I. is leading the investigation. American intelligence officials said they are virtually certain that Russian intelligence officials were behind the attack. They said that the breach appears to have extended beyond the two Democratic groups to include the personal email accounts of at least 100 Democratic officials. Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut, the top Democrat on the House subcommittee on the National Security Agency and cybersecurity, said he was not overly concerned that his personal information was released. If its simply my email being sent around, half my constituents have my email, he said. If it were to turn out that someone was hacking into emails, it would be a different situation. Worse comes to worst I can get a different email or cell number.  Mr. Himes dismissed the idea that the leak could affect his, or anyone elses, election campaign this year. Its hard for me to imagine how just having a bunch of numbers, cellphones and emails would in any way affect the election, he said. It wasnt totally unexpected.  He added that the cybersecurity subcommittee was likely to discuss the hack in more detail, saying the release of personal information made the threat feel that much more real to members. If there were the ability for someone to hack into those accounts, that really gets worrisome, he said. Someone could cause a lot of damage if they were able to send emails out from a members account, but Im not hearing that thats a risk at this point.  The D. N. C. documents that were released last month proved intensely embarrassing for committee officials because they contained emails indicating that party leaders favored Hillary Clinton as their nominee over her rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The committees interim leader, Donna Brazile, created a special cybersecurity panel this week to guard against future attacks. Much of the latest batch of documents from the House   committee, including overviews of particular races and campaigns, appeared largely innocuous in comparison to the D. N. C. breach. Beyond the cellphone numbers and email addresses for Democratic lawmakers, the latest release also included passwords for some internal databases. Mrs. Clintons campaign files do not appear to have been directly breached in the cyberattack, but the personal accounts of some campaign officials might have been, and a voting analytics program used by the campaign was opened as part of the D. N. C. breach, officials say. The American authorities remain uncertain whether the electronic   to the Democrats computer systems was intended as fairly routine cyberespionage or as part of an effort to manipulate the presidential election. The Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, urged the Russians last month to try to find 33, 000 missing emails from Mrs. Clintons personal server. But after his remark produced an intense backlash, Mr. Trump said later that he was being sarcastic."

The Six Most Important Revelations from the Comey Hearing - Breitbart,Breitbart,Colin Madine,6/8/2017,"Trump supporters, swamp dwellers, and Americans from all walks of life had their eyes glued to coverage of the testimony by former FBI Director James Comey to the Senate Intelligence Committee this morning. [The hearing was treated like a major sporting event by D. C. locals, who lined up to gain entrance to local establishments for   only viewing parties.  The Comey watch party line at Shaw Tavern stretches down the block       #ThisIsWashington pic. twitter.      Jordan J Frasier (@jordanjfrasier) June 8, 2017,  As coverage and responses to Comeys testimony continue to unfold, weve gathered together six of the most important revelations from the hearing. One thing is for sure, Comeys testimony was anything but boring. When questioned by Senator Marco Rubio ( ) Comey answered that President Donald Trump was not under investigation by the FBI. It was also revealed that congressional leaders had previously been briefed on this fact. This morning Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton joined Breitbart News Daily and predicted this fact. Fitton called allegations against Trump gossip and a nothing burger.  Comey admitted to orchestrating leaks from the investigation to the media using a network of friends. Reponse was swift on social media: Senators should ask Comey the name of the Columbia professor and then subpoena the memos from him.

Ryan Nobles (@ryanobles) June 8, 2017,  Senator Rubio pointed out the interesting fact that one of the few things not to leak out was the fact that Trump was not under investigation himself. Because if it was leaked that @realDonaldTrump was personally not under   it would have crushed the entire narrative. pic. twitter.      Dan Scavino Jr. (@DanScavino) June 8, 2017,  President Trumps personal lawyer, Marc Kasowitz, issued a blistering statement after the hearing on the subject of Comeys leaks. Senator James Risch ( ) questioned Comey early in the hearing about the possibility of obstruction of justice regarding the investigation of General Michael Flynn. Risch repeatedly questioned Comey about the exact wording used by President Trump to him in private, which Comey recorded in his   memo. The exchange leaves  Democrats hopes of impeachment for obstruction of justice considerably dimmed: Comey: I mean, its the President of the United States with me alone, saying, I hope this.  I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didnt obey that, but thats the way I took it. Risch: You may have taken it as a direction, but thats not what he said. Comey: Correct. Risch: He said, I hope.  Comey: Those are exact words, correct. Risch: You dont know of anyone thats been charged for hoping something? Comey: I dont, as I sit here. Risch: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. James Comey had a few things to say about the reporting of the New York Times which reported on collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. Senator Risch questioned Comey about the Times, asking So the American people can understand this, that report by the New York Times was not true, is that a fair statement? It was not true, Comey said. Again, all of you know this, maybe the American people dont. The challenge     Im not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information       [the challenge is] that people talking about it often dont really now whats going on and those of us who actually know whats going on are not talking about it.  Comey discussed the involvement of President Obamas Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, in the investigation of Hillary Clinton. He stated that Lynch made an odd request for how the FBI investigation should be described. At one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me, Comey said. Comey added that Lynchs infamous tarmac meeting with Bill Clinton during the campaign was the reason he decided to make a statement when the decision was made not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. In a ultimately conclusive way, that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the Justice Department, Comey said. Comey had quite a bit to say about his firing, which leaves him looking like a disgruntled former employee. Comey accused President Trump and his administration of lying about him, and defaming him and more importantly the FBI.  Comey also explained that his discomfort with the President and the belief that Trump would lie about him led to the creation of his memo on the meeting. I was honestly concerned that he might lie about the nature of our meeting, so I thought it really important to document, Comey said. I knew there might come a day when I might need a record of what happened not only to defend myself but to protect the FBI.  Comey did not comment on how his leaking of the memo through his personal network helped the FBI. Breitbart News will continue to pursue the many stories emerging from Comeys testimony.

"Limbaugh: CNNs Gone Total Pathological Now - CNN Is Clinically, Psychologically Off-Kilter - Breitbart",Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/8/2017,"Thursday on his nationally syndicated radio show, conservative talker Rush Limbaugh reacted to commentary that aired on CNN following former FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee.  In that segment, CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin declared that based on this testimony, we now know President Donald Trump is under criminal investigation. Limbaugh questioned that statement and went on to question the mental of those at CNN. Partial transcript as follows (courtesy of RushLimbaugh. com): During the break right before the conclusion the previous hour, I did something I seldom do. I actually turned on the audio here during a break. I was listening to CNN. They had a roundtable discussion. Comeys testimony had just ended so they go into closed session. Yeah, closed session, where the real juicy stuff can be thrown out there for Richard Burr to slurp up and whatever else! Im watching Toobin     Jeffrey Toobin, the supreme legal analyst at CNN     and hes acknowledging that it was true that Comey had said Trump was not a target three different times, but now he is. Today we know that there is a criminal investigation of Trump.  I went, What? What criminal investigation of Trump? Are you aware of any new investigation of Trump thats criminal? Seriously, now. Have I missed something? Well, he said it! He said, Yeah, Trump was not a target, but we know today     right in June of 2017     that there is an investigation of Trump.  And then they went to this Jim Sciutto guy (who I think Trump personally called out as fake news once in a news conference) and this guy says, Thats right, Jeffrey! Thats absolutely right, and the investigation       Thats how they identified it. They said the criminal investigation of Trump is his comment to Comey I hope you can let the Flynn thing go       CNN now says that that comment from Trump has opened a personal, new investigation of Trump. I didnt hear Comey say that, but I do know this. When Comey was asked, After Trump said all this, why didnt you resign? I mean, if its such a great affront     if Trump is saying, Gee, I hope you could find a way to let this Flynn thing go. You know, hes a good guy, and you, Comey, said, Yeah, hes a good guy. Why didnt you quit, and why didnt you report this to the attorney general? Why didnt you go out and immediately tell your colleagues at the FBI? Comey says, I guess I just wasnt courageous enough, and then he said, I didnt want to taint the investigation.  How in the world can the FBI director taint the investigation by announcing new information? Bottom line: I dont believe that this investigation of Trump is about the Flynn comment. Theyre just lying through their teeth about this     and then Jim Sciutto went on and said, You know, Anderson       Anderson Cooper was hosting. You know, Anderson, this famous dossier, the golden showers dossier that everybody says theres nothing to? Im told that there might be something to it, Anderson. Im told       You heard Comey wouldnt answer about this in open session, and Im told that there may be that this is not discredited fully, that its not fully off the table, that there might, in fact       It is fully discredited! It was made up. It was admittedly manufactured like a novel. It is total fiction, this golden showers memo. But theres CNN now claiming that Trump is under investigation as of today, despite Comey saying that he was not a target three different times, and that dossier? Thats still active. There may, in fact, be something there! This is why I dont want you to get caught up in this stuff because youre just gonna get frustrated. Youre just dealing with people who have       CNNs gone total pathological now. CNN is clinically, psychologically  . Somethings happened over there and everybody working there is lost, and I mean this in the greatest sincerity. They have been so overtaken by whatever it is, the hate that governs them. You know, hate is a poison. The longer you hate and the longer you hold on to it and dont let it go, the more poisonous and destructive it becomes. And these people have forfeited all presence in reality. Theyre off on a dangerous, dangerous pathological trail now: Openly, wantonly lying about Trump being under investigation and this memo now. Theres something to it! Ive got sources that say that this is big! Theyre going to really dig even further into this.  Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
"FNCs Wallace: Comeys Testimony Legally Good For Trump, Politically Very Damaging - Breitbart",Breitbart,Pam Key,6/8/2017,"Thursday on Fox News Channels special coverage of former FBI Director James Comeys testimony, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace said while Comeys testimony was good news legally for President Donald Trump, politically he thought it was very damaging.   Wallace said If I were Donald Trumps lawyer Id be pretty happy, because he repeatedly said up to the day he was fired, Comey said that there was no evidence that led to an investigation of Donald Trump  He was not under investigation and on the question of obstruction of justice, while he said that was an open question, that will have to be decided by the special counsel Robert Muller. He certainly didnt indicate that he viewed it as obstruction of justice or at least a prosecutable case. He said he had no doubt that Trump was directing him to end the investigation, but as I say, as a lawyer, I would take some solace in both of those. My guess is when Marc Kasowitz, the presidents lawyer comes out sometime between 1:30 and 2:00 today, hes going to declare victory and say Comey cleared Trump. And in a legal sense, you could say that he did. He continued, Politically, I thought it was very damaging to the president. As has been pointed out by Shannon repeatedly, James Comey called the president a liar, said that he lied about the FBI was in disarray, that he defamed him and the FBI, said that the reason he kept those kinds of notes in the first place is that he thought that this was the kind of man who would lie about those kinds of things. Its not good stuff to have said on national television. And as been noted before, I think the strongest point about Flynn and why it what was so improper what the president said about Flynn in that Oval Office meeting on February 14, as you said, why on earth would you kick out the attorney general, the vice president, and the chief of staff if it was going to be something innocent? That was a very strong evidence.  (  Grabien)"
CNNs Toobin Post-Comey Hearing: We Know Trump Is Under Criminal Investigation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Jeff Poor,6/8/2017,"Thursday on CNNs Inside Politics, immediately following a Senate Intelligence Committee hearing featuring testimony from former FBI Director James Comey, network senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin emphasized what he thought were the highlights of the hearing.  However, at the end of rehashing those highlights, despite written testimony from Comey suggesting otherwise, Toobin declared that we now know Trump is under criminal investigation because of this hearing. Partial transcript as follows: ANDERSON COOPER: So many key points today to go over that Jim Comey took what Donald Trump said about Michael Flynn as a directive, that he did not go to Jeff Sessions he says because he knew or assumed that Jeff Sessions would have to recuse himself. Jeff Sessions did so two weeks later. TOOBIN: And I think the February 14 meeting remains the focus and the crucial issue in this whole investigation because that is the most incriminating act that the president took in terms of a possible obstruction of justice case telling Jim Comey and Comey clearly felt he was ordered to stop this investigation. COOPER: Even though the president said, I hope.  TOOBIN: Yes. It was an interesting exchange     it was with the senator from Maine, Angus King, who they both     the famous line about Thomas Beckett, Who will rid me of this meddlesome previous.  You dont tell someone, but you know you send the message. There is also the point where there is the clearest conflict between Comey and Trump. COOPER: Because the president has denied     TOOBIN: Trump has said I didnt make any sort of order. There was that question at the press conference that we played. So I think, you know, that remains the most important point of conflict. And the other point I think Dana alluded to this, but I think its very important     there was a     in the letter that Trump wrote firing Comey, he said three times you told me that I was not under investigation and that was in May. Well, here we know in June Donald Trump is under criminal investigation, and thats a big deal, and thats important. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
Matthews: Trump-Russia Collusion Theory Came Apart With Comey Testimony - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/8/2017,"Thursday during MSNBCs coverage of former FBI Director James Comeys testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee, Hardball host Chris Matthews said in Comeys testimony accusations that President Donald Trump directly colluded with Russia to interfere in the 2016 U. S. election came apart.   Matthews said, I think the headlines in terms of wire service coverage he called the president a liar. I think thats a headline. The reason he memorialized everything, he thought the president would lie about it. He also said Id like to see any tapes played. If there are any White House tapes, he wants them played. The bigger story, Nicole touched on it there, the assumption of the critics of the president, of his pursuers, you might say, is that somewhere along the line in the last year is the president had something to do with colluding with the Russians, to feeding their desire to affect the election in some way. Some role they played, some conversation with Michael Flynn or Paul Manafort. But yet what came apart was that theory.  He continued, Two regards, the president said according to the written tell me of Mr. Comey go ahead and give anybody satellite to my operation and nail them. Im with you on that, that would mean Manafort, Carter Page, somebody like that. And then what was fascinating, Comey basically said that Flynn wasnt central to the Russia investigation, that he was touching on it. Of course, Flynn wasnt honest in the answering of the official forms to become national security head, but they only touched on that. It wasnt related to that but that he could be flipped for that. In other words, they could flip him because they had him on something he dishonestly answered but it wasnt central to the Russia thing. I always assumed what Trump was afraid of he had said something to Flynn and Flynn could be flipped on that, and Flynn would testify against the president that he had some conversation with Flynn in terms of dealing with the Russians affirmatively. And if thats not the case, wheres the  ? If it isnt Manafort because he wants to throw him under the bus. Where is the concern that Trump has that has put him on defense for these months?

EPA Delays Obama Air Pollution Rule - Breitbart,Breitbart,Sean Moran,6/8/2017,"The Trump administration will delay the implementation of a major Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) air pollution rule from the Obama administration. [The EPA announced the delay on the ozone pollution rule, EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt notified governors this week.  States have made tremendous progress and significant investment cleaning up the air. We will continue to work with states to ensure they are on a path to compliance, Pruitt said in a statement. We are committed to working with states and local officials to effectively implement the ozone standard in a manner that is supportive of air quality improvement efforts without interfering with local decisions or impeding economic growth, he added. The EPAs statement cited increased regulatory burdens, restrictions on infrastructure investment, and increased cost to businesses.  Pruitt stated that his decision to delay the air pollution rule relies on a stipulation in the Clean Air Act that would allow the agency to suspend rules up to a year if the agency has insufficient information to make compliance decisions. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, one of the leaders in the lawsuit challenging the rule, cheered Pruitts decision. Paxton said, I am grateful for the leadership of EPA Administrator Pruitt in courageously pausing the costly and ineffective ozone rule, and Im hopeful that the one year delay will provide time for the EPA to review the detrimental effects the ozone rule will have on the Texas economy.  The 2015 Obama regulation set the allowable ozone level of pollution in the atmosphere to 70 parts per billion, down from the 75 parts per billion set in 2008. Obamas EPA predicted that the rule would result in billions of dollars in economic benefits through improvements in public health. This attracted significant criticism. Industry officials argue that the rule would cost more than $1 trillion and questioned its potential health benefits. EPA chief Pruitt said that the agency will undertake a review of the rule in response to Republican states and industry suing the   EPA. Pruitt himself was part of the lawsuit when he was Oklahomas attorney general. Senator Jeff Flake ( ) applauded the EPAs rule delay and said that the agency protects the environment, instead of the previous administrations   approach. Flake said, Its great to see the EPA working with Arizonans for a change. Nowhere are the flaws of previous administrations     approach to regulating ozone more evident than in Arizona, a desert state where   ozone makes it impossible to meet the new federal mandate. While todays move buys Arizona   time, I remain committed to advancing a solution that will provide permanent relief from this egregious and unworkable rule."
U.S. Baby Boomer Gentrification Wreaks Havoc on City in Socialist Ecuador - Breitbart,Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/8/2017,"The small city of Cuenca, Ecuador is struggling to address a growing wave of American Baby Boomers who have decided to retire there to take advantage of a socialist welfare state designed for its locals. [U. S. retirees, a recent city study revealed, are also causing conflict in the city, raising real estate prices, demanding   service, and threatening to sue locals accustomed to more casual business contracts.  In a report this week, the Miami Herald highlights the blissful existence of   white American migrants who have flocked to Cuenca, attracted by retiree blogs and news sites that emphasize the appeal of its temperate weather and inexpensive healthcare and real estate. In Cuenca, a city of about 350, 000 people, theyve found robust public transportation, an extensive museum network, solid healthcare and markets bursting with fresh fruits and produce, the Herald notes. Its a place where their       bath apartment costs less than $400 a month. Theyve found that for about $1, 500 a month, they can live a solidly   lifestyle, dining out frequently and traveling.  The newspaper notes that a bus ride for seniors costs $0. 12, and medical procedures are orders of magnitude cheaper than they would be at home. The city commissioned a study on its foreign population in February 2017 that identified the majority of these new Cuencans as baby boomers who began retiring in 2010 and       4 percent of this population, estimated at 78 million, is planning to retire abroad.  North American countries     mostly the U. S. and Canada     make up 93 percent of Cuencas foreign population. Cuencas boomers are more likely to have been professors before retirement than any other occupations, with executives coming in second place. The study delicately notes that many of these individuals are not interested in being part of a new culture, and are more interested in that the city and its people respond to their needs and demands.  Paramount among the citys concerns is that many Americans are demanding Cuencans speak English and creating   neighborhoods within the city. There is a large group for which learning a language is outside of their interests and, faced with the frustration of not being able to communicate, express annoyance with Cuencans who do not tend to their demands in English, the study reads, adding that the city has invested in Spanish and idiomatic dictionaries for the new residents, but this has not solved the problem. Boomers are also annoyed by the slowness of service in Ecuador compared to the United States, and the common use of verbal or informal contracts. Cases have been reported in which retired foreigners suggest a lawsuit against those who have not completed a previously agreed upon work, the report notes. In addition to cultural tensions, the study notes that 65 percent of the native Cuencan population is under 35, and many are frustrated that they must pay taxes and invest in the welfare state that foreign retiree migrants are now abusing. The Herald story, which cites some findings from this study, is the latest trend piece on Cuenca in a crowded genre. The Cuenca study followed years of anecdotal journalism noting the idiosyncratic Boomer wave moving south. The city of Cuenca, in a study published in February, found its foreign population grew 173 percent between 2001 and 2010. By 2012, outlets like the BBC were calling it an American promised land.  That article traced the Cuenca viral sensation among retiree migrants back to an article on the website Gringo Tree, which in turn noted that the wave of thousands of American   hitting the city followed the 2009 publication of an article in International Living that described the city as the top destination in the world to retire.  At the time, Cuencas International Relations Director Dani Jara appeared pleased by the new influx of high spenders to her city. She told BBC, Tourism we promote, one creates strategies for the medium and long term. But in the case of a migratory phenomenon, that is due to the city conditions. Cuenca has grown throughout its history into a city where one can live well.  By 2013, Cuenca Mayor Paul Granda was describing the mass migrant wave as a little complicated for us.  The city is less accessible to Ecuadorians due to the wealthy Americans flocking there, he argued to ABC News, noting that average prices of basic goods had increased 40 to 50 percent. Two years later, Ecuadors Secretary of the Vice Ministry of Human Mobility was warning of wealthy American ghettos threatening the character of Cuenca. There should not be ghettos forming in zones where Americans live, versus those who live permanently in these places, Humberto Cordero said. The migration, he urged, must be regulated.  Cuencas American invasion was not regulated, in part because local businesses and real estate owners preferred selling and renting to Americans. They care for their spaces and pay what is fair, Cuencan homeowner Mara Torres told Ecuadors El Comercio newspaper last year. She noted that their comfortable economic status and lack of children made for quiet, reliable tenants. The government has nonetheless continued to express concern over American migrants overrunning the city. New International Relations Director Ana Paulina Crespo told the Herald in this weeks column that Cuencanos are feeling like strangers in their own city and emphasized, Cuenca never wanted to attract retirees       were facing lots of problems over how to deal with a phenomenon that we arent responsible for creating.

"Harry Reid Cites Evidence of Russian Tampering in U.S. Vote, and Seeks F.B.I. Inquiry - The New York Times",New York Times,David E. Sanger,6/8/2017,"The Senate minority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada, asked the F. B. I. on Monday to investigate evidence suggesting that Russia may try to manipulate voting results in November. In a letter to the F. B. I. director, James B. Comey Jr. Mr. Reid wrote that the threat of Russian interference is more extensive than is widely known and may include the intent to falsify official election results.  Recent classified briefings from senior intelligence officials, Mr. Reid said in an interview, have left him fearful that President Vladimir V. Putins goal is tampering with this election.  News reports on Monday said the F. B. I. warned state election officials several weeks ago that foreign hackers had exported voter registration data from computer systems in at least one state, and had pierced the systems of a second one. The bureau did not name the states, but Yahoo News, which first reported the confidential F. B. I. warning, said they were Arizona and Illinois. Matt Roberts, a spokesman for Arizonas secretary of state, said the F. B. I. had told state officials that Russians were behind the Arizona attack. After the F. B. I. warning, Arizona took its voter registration database offline from June 28 to July 8 to allow for a forensic exam of its systems, Mr. Roberts said. The F. B. I. in its notice to states, said the voter information had been exfiltrated, which means that it was shipped out of the state systems to another computer. But it does not mean that the data itself was tampered with. It is unclear whether the hackers intended to affect the election or pursued the data for other purposes, like gaining personal identifying information about voters. The F. B. I. warning referred to targeting activity against state boards of elections, but did not discuss the intent of the hackers. That incident was only a small part of what disturbed me, Mr. Reid said on Monday. In his letter to the F. B. I. he offered no specifics about how Russian hackers could manipulate election data, an effort made harder by the varying   procedures in each state. But the prospect of election tampering has been discussed since the revelation that two Russian intelligence agencies, the F. S. B. and the G. R. U. were believed to be responsible for the hacking of the networks of the Democratic National Committee. Emails published by a hacker who called himself Guccifer 2. 0     believed to be an alias for Russian hackers linked to the intelligence agencies     revealed that the committee had denigrated the campaign of Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont. The disclosures led to the resignation of Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida as the committees chairwoman. Mr. Reids accusation that Russia is seeking not only to influence the election with propaganda but also to tamper with the vote counting goes significantly beyond anything the Obama administration has said in public. While intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have high confidence that Russian intelligence services were behind the hacking of the Democratic committee, the administration has not leveled any accusations against Mr. Putins government. Asked about that in the interview, Mr. Reid said he was free to say things the president was not. But Mr. Reid argued that the connections between some of Donald J. Trumps former and current advisers and the Russian leadership should, by itself, prompt an investigation. He referred indirectly in his letter to a speech given in Russia by one Trump adviser, Carter Page, a consultant and investor in the energy giant Gazprom, who criticized American sanctions policy toward Russia. Trump and his people keep saying the election is rigged, Mr. Reid said. Why is he saying that? Because people are telling him the election can be messed with.  Mr. Trumps advisers say they are concerned that unnamed elites could rig the election for his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Reid argued that if Russia concentrated on less than six swing states, it could alter results and undermine confidence in the electoral system. That would pose challenges, given that most states have paper backups, but he noted that hackers could keep people from voting by tampering with the rolls of eligible voters."
Outrage as Saudi Soccer Team Refuse to Participate in Silence for London Attack Victims,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,6/8/2017,"The Saudi Arabian football (soccer) team has refused to line up and respect a silence held to remember the victims of the London Bridge attack, claiming it is not in keeping with our culture.

Farshid Raminfar (@Farshidraminfar) June 8, 2017,  A spokesman for the Football Federation Australia told Daily Mail Australia he was informed before the match that the Saudi team would not take part. The FFA sought agreement from the Asian Football Confederation and the Saudi national team to hold a minutes silence in memory of those lost in Saturday nights terror bombings in London and in particular the two Australian women, the spokesman said. Both the AFC and the Saudi team agreed that the minute of silence could be held. The FFA was further advised by Saudi team officials that this tradition was not in keeping with Saudi culture and they would move to their side of the field and respect our custom whilst taking their own positions on the field. The local broadcaster, FOXSPORTS, was informed of this prior to the minutes silence taking place.  Around 85 to 95 per cent of Saudi Arabian citizens are Sunni Muslims, with 10 to 15 per cent practising Shia Islam. Christians are forbidden from worshipping publicly. Shia imam Sheikh Mohammad Tawhidi told the Mail the Saudi teams decision not to participate was not about the practice being   but because the dead were  .

In their eyes, the attackers are martyrs who are going to paradise. If they stand for a minute of silence, they are against their Muslim brothers who fought for jihad and fought the infidels.

House Passes Bill To Repeal and Replace Post-Crisis Wall Street Rules - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Carney,6/8/2017,"The House of Representatives on Thursday passed legislation to   and replace many of the financial regulations enacted during the Obama administration in reaction to the 2008 financial crisis. [The House passed the Financial Choice Act by a vote of 233 to 186, with Republican lawmakers in support and Democrats opposed.  The Choice Act is an ambitious piece of legislation that would replace many of the complex rules created by the   Act of 2010 with a new paradigm of regulation. The bill would allow banks that fund their operations with capital beyond a certain threshold to step into a   system of regulation in which the amount of supervisory oversight would be greatly reduced. Although it is supported by the Trump White House, the bill is unlikely to pass the Senate. Democrats have signaled their ongoing support for   and view the Choice Act as letting banks off the hook for the financial crisis."
Stephen Curry has a great perspective on having a smaller salary than 81 other NBA players,Business Insider,Cork Gaines,6/8/2017,"The Golden State Warriors Stephen Curry is not paid like one of   the top players in the NBA. However, he has a great perspective   on that status, and it comes from his father, Dell Curry, a   former NBA player.     Stephen Curry, the   reigning NBA MVP, is in the final   year of a   $44 million extension he signed with the   Warriors in 2012. His salary this season     $12. 1 million        and fourth among his teammates.     While the contract has been a steal for the Warriors,  at the time. Curry was a gifted shooter, but   he had been plagued with ankle injuries and hadnt yet developed   into an   player.     In a recent interview with  Curry was asked how he dealt with playing with   lesser players who made a lot more money. Curry said he kept   things in perspective by leaning on some advice his father once   gave him.     One thing my pops always told me is you never count another   mans money, Curry told Kawakami. Its what youve got and how   you take care of it. And if Im complaining about $44 million   over four years, then Ive got other issues in my life.      Curry added that when he signed the deal, he knew he was taking   less than other players but wasnt going to regret the decision:     While Curry is making $12. 1 million at a time when Harrison   Barnes, his former teammate, is making nearly twice that ($22. 1   million) with the Dallas Mavericks, Currys situation could soon   be rectified.     If Curry   with the Warriors this summer, as expected, he   will be eligible for a   $207. 4 million contract,   . His salary next season would jump to $35. 7 million   and reach about $48 million in the final season.     If that happens, you can be certain that other players will be   counting Currys money.

Apples first foray into making a TV show is an unintentionally comical train wreck,Business Insider,Avery Hartmans,6/8/2017,"The first episode of Apples new reality show, Planet of the Apps, has arrived     and its a total mess. The show is a Shark Tank  competition among app developers vying to gain a mentor who will turn their app into the next Facebook, along with a bag stuffed with venture capital money; In other words, the Silicon Valley dream. This is the first original TV show made by Apple and it  Of course, making good television requires different muscles than building beautiful hardware. And Apples inexperience in this realm quickly shows up in a variety of clumsy, comical and at times   scenes throughout the   show. Business Insider watched the first episode (new episodes will be released every Tuesday). Heres the good, the bad and the ugly from Apples first foray into TV entertainment: None of the hosts has ever developed an app. With the exception of Gwyneth Paltrow (whose company, Goop, built a travel app called  none of the hosts own companies, or are affiliated with, companies that build apps. None of the hosts even really work in tech at all, unless you count Will. i. ams  or Gary Vaynerchuks early tech investments in Facebook and Twitter.  So, why are these four judging a show about making a hit app? Thats the biggest mystery of Planet of the Apps, and one that the judges themselves seem stumped by. At several points throughout the first episode, the judges bow out of mentoring a company because they have zero expertise in the field.    Its awkward to watch, and probably even more awkward (and disconcerting) for the contestants. No one seemed outwardly phased by their escalator ride, but as a viewer, it was hard to watch. And its another unecessary affectation that gives the show a forced, convoluted feel. Why not use a simple timer and buzzer to ensure the pitches stay concise? Why not have a digital scoreboard showing the judges decision instead of digitizing the floorboards?  Apple seemed hellbent on differentiating the show from Shark Tank, and the results look   confusing, and, frankly, a little amateurish.  . ..but not because it was a great idea. The judges quickly pointed out a flaw that the founders seemingly hadnt considered even once: the app encouraged men to pick out attractive women and confront them in person. The app put women in the awkward position of having to be both hunted down by strange men, then having to reject them to their face. The founders confused and progressively heartbroken expressions as things went from bad to worse served as one of the few unintentionally humorous portions of the episode, along with Will. i. am calling the apps consequences a sausage fest.  Alba described Twist as dudes trying to holler and immediately pointed out that it was clear none of the apps founders had consulted a single woman while building their service. She encouraged the founders to actually talk to a woman about their idea rather than creating an app for men to stalk women. And her reaction when asked if shed changed her mind about mentoring the team was priceless: Still red, she said while laughing and miming a hard no.  Vaynerchuks character seems intended to be the enforcer, but he lacks the charm or empathy to balance the occasional harshness of his opinions. He may win us over in coming episodes, but the first 50 minutes were unpleasant. To be fair, however, Will. i. am and Paltrow barely spoke throughout the entire episode and either looked bored or perplexed, while Albas reactions and critiques were all over the map.  The introduction of Liew and his partners Aaron Batalion, Alex Taussig, and Nicole Quinn lent some gravitas to the show. Their questions were pointed, their expertise in apps and platforms was more legitimate, and they clearly knew their way around a startup pitch session. The presence of Jeremy Liew     one of the first VCs to invest in Snapchat     made the show feel as if a grownup had finally arrived to right the ship.  Planet of the Apps seems unsure whether it wants to be a serious show that can expound on the finer points of one of the hottest     and most complex     technologies of today, or whether it wants to attract average consumers who buy baby wipes from Honest Company or used to listen to the Black Eyed Peas. As someone in the tech field, I felt both terribly confused about the mapping capabilities of augmented reality, while simultaneously feeling condescended to when the definition for burn rate popped up at the bottom of the screen. Planet of the Apps tried to do everything at once, but somehow failed at doing anything well.  The pure, uninhibited joy Wayne and Ernst clearly felt at getting an investment was sweet to watch. After 50 minutes, viewers were finally treated to real emotion and excitement by people who actually seemed to like apps. You could tell that the Companion founders enjoyed their experience on the show, even though no one else present really seemed to.  and the real shame here is that theyve already produced nine more episodes of it.  The first episode of Apples new reality show. .."
Did Putin Try to Steal an American Election? - The New York Times,New York Times,Nicholas Kristof,6/8/2017,"Some foreign leaders settle for stealing billions of dollars. Russias president, Vladimir Putin, may have wanted to steal something even more valuable: an American presidential election. As our election takes a turn that could be drawn from a Cold War spy novel (except it would be too implausible) Putin has an obvious favorite in the race: Donald Trump. Its crystal clear to me that Putin favors Trump, says Michael McFaul, a Stanford professor who was ambassador to Russia until 2014. If I were Putin, I would rather deal with Trump, too, given the things he has said about foreign policy.  Look, Democratic Party leaders exchanged inappropriate emails showing bias for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders, and a hackers disclosure has properly triggered a ruckus. But that scandal pales beside an effort apparently by a foreign dictatorship to disrupt an American presidential election. It also seems scandalous to me that Trump on Wednesday effectively invited Russia to hack into Clintons computers for deleted emails from when she was secretary of state, saying at a press conference, Russia, if youre listening, I hope youre able to find the 30, 000 emails that are missing.  Yes, Trump is entertaining. But increasingly, the antonym of gravitas is Trump.  Clinton could have responded by inviting Russia to hack into Trumps computers and release his tax returns she didnt because the hack would be illegal and her plea would be unpresidential. In his press conference, Trump also cast doubt on the idea that Russia hacked the Democratic National Committees computers. Its probably not Russia, he said, suggesting it might be China, or some guy with a 200 I. Q.  So lets go through the evidence. Americas intelligence agencies have assessed with high confidence that Russias government was behind the hack, and private security companies have identified two Russian teams of hackers that were inside D. N. C. computers. One team is called Cozy Bear and is linked to the F. S. B. the successor to the K. G. B. and another is called Fancy Bear and is linked to the G. R. U. or Russian military intelligence. Cyber experts are very familiar with both Cozy Bear and Fancy Bear. The next question is whether Russia was also behind the release of the stolen emails to WikiLeaks. Someone using the name Guccifer 2. 0 claimed to be behind the hack, denied Russian involvement and claimed to be Romanian     but wrote Romanian badly. ThreatConnect, a private security firm, issued a meticulous report showing that Guccifer used a   VPN (virtual private network) service and displayed other heavy traces of Russian activity.  Guccifer 2. 0 is a Russian propaganda effort, ThreatConnect concluded. After talking to experts, I have the sense that theres considerable confidence that Russia is the culprit, but more doubt about whether Putin gave the order and about whether the aim was to benefit Trump or simply to create havoc. I think the most likely explanation is that someone in Russian intelligence, probably very high up, decided to help Donald Trump, said Benjamin Wittes, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, but he added that theres no solid evidence for this. One reason for caution is that history shows that intelligence community is sometimes an oxymoron. In the 1980s, the United States accused Russia of conducting chemical warfare in Southeast Asia, citing yellow rain in jungles there. Years later, it turned out that this yellow rain may have actually been bee excrement. Democrats should be particularly wary of hinting that Trump is some sort of conscious pawn of the Russians, or is controlled by Moscow through financial investments. Its true that his son Donald Trump Jr. said in 2008 that we see a lot of money pouring in from Russia.  But do you really think that if Trump were an agent he would have exaggerated his ties, as he did last year, saying of Putin, I got to know him very well? In fact, Trump acknowledged Wednesday, he has never even met Putin. The reason Moscow favors Trump isnt some conspiracy. Its simply that Putin dislikes Clinton, while Trumps combination of international ignorance and catastrophic policies would benefit Putin. In particular, Trumps public doubts about NATO renounce more than half a century of bipartisan orthodoxy on how to deal with Russia, and undermine the Western alliance that checks Putin. One nightmare of security specialists is Russia provoking unrest among ethnic Russians in Estonia, Latvia or Lithuania and then using rioting as an excuse to intervene. NATO members would be obliged to respond, but frankly its not clear that they would     and Trumps loose rhetoric increases the risk of paralysis and a collapse of the alliance. In that sense, Trump poses a national security risk to the West, and thats reason enough Putin would be thrilled to see him elected president."
McCain Lights Up Social Media with Comey Questioning: Shouldnt Stay Up Late Watching the Diamondbacks,Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/8/2017,"Social Media and news outlets had a field day with Sen.

In other words, were complete     the investigation of anything that former Secretary Clinton had to do with a campaign is over, and we dont have to worry about it anymore? McCain said. Comey seemed confused at the line of questioning, and not long after the hearing ended McCain issued a statement: I get the sense from Twitter that my line of questioning today went over peoples heads. Maybe going forward I shouldnt stay up late watching the Diamondbacks night games. What I was trying to get at was whether Mr. Comey believes that any of his interactions with the President rise to the level of obstruction of justice. In the case of Secretary Clintons emails, Mr. Comey was willing to step beyond his role as an investigator and state his belief about what no reasonable prosecutor would conclude about the evidence. I wanted Mr. Comey to apply the same approach to the key question surrounding his interactions with President Trump   whether or not the Presidents conduct constitutes obstruction of justice. While I missed an opportunity in todays hearing, I still believe this question is important, and I intend to submit it in writing to Mr. Comey for the record.

Marco Rubio: I Didnt Defend Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Tony Lee,6/8/2017,"Sen.

Tom Cotton ( )   dined with Trump at the White House this week, pushed back against that characterization on Twitter, calling out a Miami Herald headline that read, Rubio defends Trump, pushes Comey to say Trump wasnt involved in Russia probe.

CBS News (@CBSNews) June 8, 2017,  During the hearing, Rubio pointed out that the only thing not leaked to mainstream media outlets was the inconvenient fact that Comey had told Trump that the President was not under FBI investigation. Do you ever wonder why, of all the things in the investigation, the only thing never leaked is the fact the president was never personally under investigation, despite the fact that Democrats and Republicans and the leadership of congress have known that for weeks? Rubio asked. Rubio also mentioned to Comey, We keep talking about this cloud, you perceive the cloud to be the Russia investigation in general, but the specific ask [from Trump] was that you would tell the American people what you had already told him, what you had already told the leaders of Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, that he was not personally under investigation.  Despite Comeys exchange with Sen. James Risch ( ) in which Comey admitted that Trump did not direct him to drop Flynns case and only hoped that he would, Rubio also told mainstream media outlets that he is not going to rule out that Trump may have obstructed justice. Im not prepared to reach a conclusion on that, because were not done with all the other pieces that are missing, he reportedly said. As Breitbart News    Joel Pollak noted, Comey all but destroyed any hope Democrats had for bringing a case of obstruction of justice against Trump during his exchange with Risch. Rubio and Trump were bitter rivals during the contentious 2016 GOP primary campaign. Trump ruthlessly mocked Rubio as Little Marco.  Rubio later ridiculed Trump for his small hands and spray tan."
Trump says he feels completely and totally vindicated after Comeys testimony,Business Insider,David Choi,6/8/2017,"President Donald Trumps private attorney, Marc Kasowitz, said      completely and totally vindicated by James Comeys opening   statement to the Senate Intelligence Committee which said that   Trump was not personally being investigated amid the FBIs     Russia inquiry.

"Russia, Suspected in Hacking, Has Uneasy History With Hillary Clinton - The New York Times",New York Times,Mark Landler,6/8/2017,"PHILADELPHIA     Follow along with our coverage of the Democratic National Convention. Donald J. Trumps apparent endorsement on Wednesday of Russian cyberspying against Hillary Clinton has pulled President Vladimir V. Putin fully into the American political fray. But Mr. Putins relationship with Mrs. Clinton has been tense at least since 2011, when, as secretary of state, she accused him of rigging an election and he accused her of meddling in Russian politics. Mr. Putin     who was then the prime minister, plotting his return to the presidency     said her words were a signal to protesters, encouraging them to take to the streets, which they did in large numbers. Her remarks also annoyed the White House, which at that time still clung to the hope that President Obamas policy of resetting relations with Russia could be salvaged. That episode, late in Mrs. Clintons tenure as secretary of state, is important to understanding why Mr. Putins government could have a motive for hacking into the Democratic National Committees computers and leaking emails to damage her electoral prospects against Mr. Trump. But it also speaks to the   stance toward Russia and Mr. Putin that Mrs. Clinton staked out in the Obama administration. At the same time that she was condemning Russia over its elections, Mr. Obamas national security adviser, Tom Donilon, was planning to travel to Moscow to meet Mr. Putin her harsh words complicated his diplomacy. Above all, the bitter exchange attests to a combustible relationship between two ambitious,   leaders, both unafraid to exercise power     one a former K. G. B. officer who emerged from the shadows the other a famous female politician who spent decades on the public stage. In our administration, Secretary Clinton always had a tougher line toward Putin and the Russians than other senior administration officials, said Michael A. McFaul, an adviser on Russia who served as United States ambassador to Moscow. It was Putins strong belief that we, with Clinton in the lead, were trying to meddle with his regime.  It was one of several instances where Mrs. Clinton was more hawkish than her boss     differences the White House and the Clinton campaign have so far played down but which may loom larger in the general election. Certainly, Mrs. Clinton has been open in saying she would push back harder than Mr. Obama has against Mr. Putins aggression in Ukraine and Syria. Mrs. Clintons first meeting with Mr. Putin as secretary of state set the stage for a stormy relationship. When she went to see him in his dacha outside Moscow on March 19, 2010, he kept her waiting in front of a ceramic mantelpiece, facing a forest of cameras and boom microphones. Mr. Putin finally turned up for what was billed as a brief photo opportunity, only to lecture her in front of the reporters about how the United States needed to lift sanctions against American companies doing business in Iran. And when Mrs. Clinton started to defend the Obama administrations policy, he promptly ordered the news media out of the room. Mrs. Clinton laughed off the episode, telling reporters what has become an   story about their relationship. Prime Minister Putin, she recalled asking him amid his harangue about trade policy, tell me about what youre doing to save the tigers in Siberia.  Eyes brightening, Mr. Putin motioned her to his private office downstairs, where he showed her a map of Russia. Pointing to various regions, he delivered a fervent lecture about endangered tigers and polar bears. He asked her whether Bill Clinton would go on a   expedition with him in Siberia. If Bill was not available, he said, maybe Hillary would go? Diplomats traveling with her were impressed. Its like he sizes somebody up and sees them as a worthy adversary or counterpart, said William J. Burns, a former ambassador to Moscow who served as Mrs. Clintons deputy at the State Department. Ive seen him with other people who he didnt see that way, and hed be much more dismissive and snarky.  In retrospect, though, the meeting planted the seeds for future tensions. Eight months later, Mrs. Clinton canceled her attendance at a meeting he organized in St. Petersburg to save the tigers. Her excuse was that she had to stay in Washington to lobby the Senate to ratify a new arms reduction treaty. A year later, Mrs. Clinton was traveling in Lithuania when reports of ballot tampering and other fraud emerged after parliamentary elections in Russia. The Russian people, like people everywhere, deserve the right to have their voices heard and their votes counted, she said in a statement, drafted by her spokeswoman, Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat and Soviet expert known for her   views about Russia. Putin was livid that she had spoken out, Mr. McFaul said.   Russian officials even called the White House to ask whether she was speaking for the United States. That created a tempest in the West Wing, since Mr. McFaul had signed off on Mrs. Clintons statement. Although the president was also skeptical of Mr. Putins intentions, he, too, had hoped to keep the reset policy alive a little longer. There was no evidence that Mrs. Clinton had any regrets. Shortly before she left the State Department, she asked her top policy aide, Jake Sullivan, to draft a      exit memo from her to Mr. Obama, warning him that the reset policy was dead, that relations with Russia would deteriorate under Mr. Putin and that the United States needed to push back hard. Advisers to Mrs. Clinton said they were confident she would pursue such a strategy as president. Mr. Trumps latest comments     in which he said he hoped Russia would find and expose thousands of emails that Mrs. Clinton did not hand over to the State Department     only highlighted the chasm between their positions, according to these aides. What Trump said today is reckless and demonstrates he is unfit for the Oval Office, said R. Nicholas Burns, a former top State Department official and   adviser to Mrs. Clinton. He said that he was confident that Mrs. Clinton would strongly defend the interests of the United States and its allies against any aggression by Mr. Putin. By 2014, after Russia had annexed Crimea and sent its tanks and troops to menace Ukraine, Mrs. Clintons exit memo to the president looked prescient. Speaking at a Democratic   in California in March 2014, she likened Mr. Putins behavior to Hitlers conquest of the Sudetenland in 1938. When Mr. Putin was asked about that comparison by a French television station three months later, he replied: Its better not to argue with women. Ms. Clinton had never been too graceful in her statements."
Cardinal Robert Sarah: Criticisms of Pope Benedict XVI Are Diabolical,Breitbart,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",6/8/2017,"Outspoken African Cardinal Robert Sarah has reacted fiercely to detractors of Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, accusing them of vulgarity and baseness in their criticisms of the former popes afterword to the cardinals latest book. [The arrogance, the violence of language, the disrespect and the inhuman contempt for Benedict XVI are diabolical and cover the Church with a mantle of sadness and shame, Cardinal Sarah said.  These people demolish the Church and its profound nature, he added. Critics of Benedict XVI have complained that the former Pontiff meddled in Church affairs by contributing the afterword to the German edition of the book, in which Benedict praises Cardinal Sarah and thanks Pope Francis for appointing the African prelate to his current post as prefect of the Congregation for Divine Worship. In his afterword to Cardinal Sarahs book, The Power of Silence: Against the Dictatorship of Noise, Benedict XVI wrote that the liturgy is in good hands with the Guinean cardinal, while also praising Sarah for his prayer life. Sarah, Benedict writes, speaks out of the depths of silence with the Lord, out of his interior union with him, and thus really has something to say to each one of us.  We should be grateful to Pope Francis for appointing such a spiritual teacher as head of the congregation that is responsible for the celebration of the liturgy in the Church, Benedict writes. The last line of the afterword reads, With Cardinal Sarah, a master of silence and of interior prayer, the liturgy is in good hands.  Critics were quick to accuse the former pope of interfering in Church politics and trying to undermine Pope Francis. One, the Italian liturgist Andrea Grillo, a longtime detractor of Pope Benedict, claims that the former pope has behaved in a scandalous way by writing the afterword in praise of Cardinal Sarah and his book, accusing him of clericalism and hypocrisy.  Its as if Ratzinger suddenly renounced his renunciation and wishes to influence the decisions of his successor, Grillo declared. Throughout his diatribe, Grillo refuses to call Benedict by his correct title, but insists on referring to him simply as Ratzinger or emeritus bishop.  Cardinal Sarahs sharp reaction to Benedicts critics echoes prior statements from the prelate, who never minces words. At a Washington prayer breakfast in May, 2016, the Vatican cardinal denounced   marriage, transgender bathroom laws, and attacks on the family as demonic.  In his powerful address, Sarah said that these are portentous times for the Church and for the world, while slamming gender theory as ideological colonization and decrying the insidious dismantling of religious freedom in the United States. Regarding   marriage, Sarah said that what is at stake is not an ideological war about abstract ideas but rather the protection of ourselves, children, and future generations from a demonic ideology that says children do not need mothers and fathers.  This earned the Guinean cardinal the enduring hostility of gay activists, one of whom has referred to him as one of the shrillest voices against gender ideology,   marriage, abortion, contraception and other   attacks on the family.  The African prelate, who has been dubbed a standard bearer for Catholic orthodoxy, was the worlds youngest bishop in 1979, when Pope John Paul II summoned him to don the miter at only 34 years of age.

The Daily: Making Sense of the Gorsuch Pick - The New York Times,New York Times,Michael Barbaro,6/8/2017,"On the eve of our debut episode of The Daily, President Trump delivered a major news story. For his first Supreme Court nomination, he selected Neil M. Gorsuch, a conservative judge with a sterling rsum. I spent the night in the studio talking with some of my most insightful New York Times colleagues about what it means. Maggie Haberman, a White House reporter, explains Mr. Trumps reverence for the Supreme Court. Carl Hulse, the dean of congressional reporters, explains what to expect during the confirmation process. And Adam Liptak, our chief legal correspondent, introduces the countrys new Supreme Court nominee. To understand more about Judge Gorsuch, I also talk to David Green, the chief executive of Hobby Lobby, a company at the center of one of Judge Gorsuchs most important cases. He ruled that corporations with religious owners     like Hobby Lobby     cannot be required to pay for insurance coverage for contraception. We voted for Trump, not that we agree with everything he does, Mr. Green tells me on the show, speaking for himself and his wife. The most important thing to us was the fact that we knew he would put someone there that ruled on the Constitution, he said, referring to the Supreme Court. Because if you rule on the Constitution, it would be obvious that we would not have to be forced to do something, and that we would have our religious liberties.  Tune in, and tell us what you think.

Gays for Trump Banned from Participating in Charlotte Pride Parade,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/8/2017,"Members of a   gay group say they have been banned from participating in the Charlotte Pride Parade because of their support for President Trump. [Brian Talbert told WJZY that he and another gay Trump supporter of the group Gays for Trump applied to have their float featured in Charlottes Pride Parade this year but received an email from Charlotte Pride rejecting his application.  We wanted to show that we werent the racist, bigot, misogynist whatevers. We wanted to show that we are Americans, love our country and our president. We wanted to be there to celebrate gay pride, Talbert said. For a group of people to claim to want tolerance, acceptance, and give it to every single person you can imagine to give it to, for them to sit back and judge me for exercising my right as an American to choose my leader without judgment is hypocritical, he added. A Charlotte Pride spokesperson said they have a right to turn away groups that do not reflect the mission, vision, and values of our organization.  Talbert said he plans to sue Charlotte Pride for discrimination and is already raising money for his legal fees on a GoFundMe page. The campaign has raised $3, 100 as of Thursday afternoon. He also set up a website called Deplorable Pride, which contains information on events that he is planning as alternatives to Charlotte Pride and his fundraising page."
Dramatic UK vote: How it happened,CNN,Lauren Said-Moorhouse,6/8/2017,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May remained defiant after her party lost its majority in the general election, vowing to stay in post and form a new government. But she needed to turn to the Democratic Unionist Party of Northern Ireland to give her the number of seats required  after her Conservative Party suffered a big setback at the polls    and weakened her own position on Brexit."
Theresa May to form new government with help of DUP,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/8/2017,"London (CNN) British Prime Minister Theresa May has pledged to form a government that will provide certainty and guide the country through Brexit, after voters delivered her party a huge blow at the polls.  May, who visited Buckingham Palace to meet with Queen Elizabeth II Friday, said she would work with Northern Irelands Democratic Unionist Party, which she described as her friends and allies Promising to move towards a Brexit deal, enabling Britain to exit the European Union, May said the new government would be able to work together in the interests of the whole United Kingdom. But Brexit talks    which are due to start in 10 days time    could be delayed and the Prime Ministers personal authority undermined by the shock result. In a night of high drama, Mays party shed seats to Jeremy Corbyns Labour, which surpassed expectations, leaving the Conservatives short of a working majority by just eight seats.  The result is an embarrassing turn for May who called the election three years earlier than required, to give her side a strong negotiating hand in Brexit negotiations. One of the lead negotiators for the European Union, Guy Verhofstadt, criticized May on Twitter, writing: Yet another own goal, after Cameron now May, will make already complex negotiations even more complicated. Donald Tusk, president of the European Council,  added: We dont when Brexit talks start. We know when they must end. Catastrophic results, The result also prompted criticism of May from within her own ranks as well as from the opposition.  READ: General election 2017    Live updates, George Osborne, the former finance minister who stepped down at the election, told ITV that the results were catastrophic for his party. Anna Soubry, a Conservative MP, said May would have to consider her position. Conservative MP Nigel Evans told CNN his party shot itself in the head with an irrelevant manifesto, which was peppered with arsenic. Meanwhile, Corbyn said the early results showed May had lost her mandate and called for her to resign.  People have said they have had quite enough of austerity politics, he said, repeating his campaign promises to push for better funding for health and education.  May looks to the DUP  To pass new legislation, May has turned to the DUP, a small party from Northern Ireland known for pursuing a more socially conservative agenda than the Tories.   While the party backed Britains exit from the European Union, it has pushed back in the past against a hard Brexit. Speaking Friday, leader Arlene Foster said her party would enter into discussions with the Prime Minister to bring stability to our nation at this time of great challenge. Rather than an official coalition, the partnership is likely to be on an issue by issue basis. But May is likely to attract criticism for the decision because of the DUPs stance on   marriage and abortion rights.  Upsets elsewhere, While the election brought a good result for the DUP, there were upsets elsewhere in the UK.  In Scotland, the Scottish National Party dropped a number of seats, as the Conservative Party made some rare gains. The   Liberal Democrat Party did not make its   inroads. Former leader Nick Clegg, a former Deputy Prime Minister, lost his Sheffield Hallam seat. Tim Farron, the current leader, retained his seat with only a narrow majority. Home Secretary Amber Rudd, one of Mays closest allies, barely held onto her seat of Hastings and Rye, after a recount put her just over 300 votes ahead of the Labour candidate. May experienced a gradual slide during the campaign period, in which a wide gap between the Conservatives and Labour narrowed. Predictions of Conservative success became more modest as the partys campaign faltered following a series of missteps. The Prime Minister was criticized for making a number of   on social welfare and she came under fire for a controversial proposal on who should pay for the cost of care for the elderly, a policy that became known as the dementia tax.  Her opponents also took issue with her refusal to take part in a televised debate with other party leaders. Although called as a Brexit election, the campaign was quickly overshadowed by security as two deadly terror attacks, in Manchester and London, struck.  The attacks only put May under more scrutiny for national security decisions she made during her tenure as Home Secretary, a role she held for six years in the government of her predecessor, David Cameron. The attacks triggered a heated debate on whether the police are   resourced to deal with terror threats. Police numbers across the UK were cut by 20, 000 under Mays watch as Home Secretary."
Uber Exec Fired After Sharing Womans Medical Records Who Was Raped by Driver - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/8/2017,"Just one day after firing 20 employees following a sexual harassment investigation, an Uber executive has been fired for sharing the medical records of a customer in India that was raped by her driver in 2014. [Vanity Fair reports that Ubers President of Business in the Asia Pacific, Eric Alexander, has been fired after it was discovered that the executive had been carrying the medical records of a woman raped by an Uber driver in India, allegedly showing the records to company staff. Alexander was not listed as one of the 20 employees fired following the recent investigation by law firm Perkins Coie, but he was one of 215 cases that were still under investigation.  Following the Uber rape incident in 2014, the ridesharing app was banned in Delhi until July 2015, and the company was forced to examine how they could better protect female customers. The driver in the attack was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison, but some company executives were apparently skeptical of the attack. Uber CEO Travis Kalanick denounced the attack as horrific,  but others at the company reportedly theorized that the attack was the work of Indian ridesharing company Ola, who was attempting to sabotage the competition. Alexander reportedly obtained the victims medical records while in India and shared them with CEO Travis Kalanick and V. P. of Business Emil Michael. The three men reportedly examined the report and Alexander continued to keep the records with him for a year. Uber fired 20 employees recently following a sexual harassment investigation prompted by the blog post of former employee Susan Fowler. I have just read Susan Fowlers blog, said Uber CEO Travis Kalanick about Fowlers post. What she describes is abhorrent and against everything Uber stands for and believes in. Its the first time this has come to my attention, so I have instructed Liane Hornsey, our new chief human resources officer, to conduct an urgent investigation into these allegations. We seek to make Uber a just workplace FOR EVERYONE and there can be absolutely no place for this kind of behavior at Uber     and anyone who behaves this way or thinks this is O. K. will be fired.  So far Kalanick seems to have stayed true to this promise. Lucas Nolan is a reporter for Breitbart News covering issues of free speech and online censorship.

"Comey told Trump 3 times that he wasnt under investigation, but his refusal to publicly say so infuriated Trump",Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/8/2017,"James Comey, the former FBI director, said he told President   Donald Trump on three occasions that he wasnt the subject of a   counterintelligence investigation, but Trump was upset that Comey   would not say so publicly, according to Comeys prepared written   testimony, released ahead of his blockbuster hearing on Thursday.     In the  published by the Senate Intelligence Committee on   Wednesday, Comey also said the main reason he did not publicly   announce that Trump was not part of the bureaus Russia probe was   that it would create a duty to correct, should that change.     Comey wrote in his testimony that he first assured Trump that he   was not personally under FBI investigation during his first   meeting with the   during which he and other   intelligence officials briefed him on the intelligence   communitys conclusions about Russias interference in the 2016   election.     Prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBIs   leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure     Trump that we were not investigating him   personally, Comey said. That was true; we did not have an open     case on him. We agreed I should do so if   circumstances warranted. During our    meeting at Trump   Tower, based on   Trumps reaction to the briefing   and without him directly asking the question, I offered that   assurance.     Comeys next assurance came during a dinner with Trump on January   27. Trump mentioned what Comey referred to as the salacious   material he had briefed Trump about on January 6, most likely   meaning the dossier of information, collected by a former British   spy, that claimed the Russians had compromising information about   Trump.     Trump, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the   allegations and strongly denied them, Comey wrote in the   testimony. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate   the alleged incident to prove it didnt happen. I replied that he   should give that careful thought because it might create a   narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we   werent, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative.     He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it,   Comey continued. As was my practice for conversations with   President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner   immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership   team of the FBI.     The final assurance came in March, after Comeys hearing before   the House Intelligence Committee, when he publicly announced the   FBI was investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with   Russians during the election. That investigation began in late   July.     I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on   exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had   told those congressional leaders that we were not personally   investigating President Trump, Comey said in the testimony. I   reminded him I had previously told him that.     Trump seemed agitated that Comey did not publicly confirm he was   not under investigation, according to the testimony.     He repeatedly told me, We need to get that fact out, Comey   said. I did not tell the president that the FBI and the   Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public   statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump   for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create   a duty to correct, should that change.     But Trump also seemed to welcome the FBIs investigation into his   associates, while denying personal responsibility.     The president went on to say that if there were some satellite   associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to   find that out, but that he hadnt done anything wrong and hoped I   would find a way to get it out that we werent investigating   him, Comey wrote.     Comey said in his testimony that Trump later said the     cloud hanging over his administration was   interfering with his ability to make deals for the country.     After firing Comey in early May, Trump told NBC News Lester Holt   that Comey had  that he was not under   investigation.    James Comey, the former FBI director, said he. .."
Deep State Gone Wild: Comey Asserts Unprecedented FBI Supremacy - Breitbart,Breitbart,John Carney,6/8/2017,"James Comey asserted in his extraordinary testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee that the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation is authorized to override Justice Department oversight procedures, a questionable claim which if true would raise serious questions about   rules aimed at preventing abuses by federal law enforcement officials. [The former head of the FBI told the Senate panel that he believed he had received a direction from the president in February that the FBI end its investigation of Michael Flynns alleged involvement with Russia   a direction with which he and his   of FBI senior leadership unilaterally decided not to comply. The Comey cabinet then decided that it would not report the receipt of this direction to Attorney General Jeff Sessions or any other Justice Department superior.  The group decided that it could override standard FBI protocol and possibly legal obligations to report the incident because of its expectations that Sessions would recuse himself from the Russia matter, although that recusal would not come until weeks later. The Comey cabinet also decided that it wasnt obligated to approach the acting Deputy Attorney General because he would likely be replaced soon. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in   investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney Generals role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role, Comey said. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed.  According to three different former federal law enforcement officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, there is no precedent for the director of the FBI to refuse to inform a Deputy Attorney General of a matter because of his or her acting status nor to use the expectation of a recusal as a basis for withholding information. This is an extraordinary usurpation of power. Not something youd expect from the supposedly    guys at the top of the FBI, one of those officials told Breitbart News. The closest precedent to the Comey cabinets decision to conceal information from Justice Department superiors is likely Comeys widely criticized earlier decision to go public about the investigation of Hillary Clintons emails. That decision received a sharp rebuke in the May 9 memo by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein that formed the basis for Comeys firing by Trump. Rosenstein criticized Comeys decision to act without consultation from the Department of Justice as usurping the Attorney Generals authority and an attempt to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. Comey had violated a   process for how to deal with situations where to Attorney General faces a conflict of interest, according to Rosenstein. The Director was wrong to usurp the Attorney Generals authority on July 5, 2016, Rosenstein wrote. The Director now defends his decision by asserting that he believed attorney General Loretta Lynch had a conflict. But the FBI Director is never empowered to supplant federal prosecutors and assume command of the Justice Department. There is a   process for other officials to step in when a conflict requires the recusal of the Attorney General. On July 5, however, the Director announced his own conclusions about the nations most sensitive criminal investigation, without the authorization of duly appointed Justice Department leaders.  Comeys testimony on Thursday seemed to   on this defense, which amounts to a claim that the FBIs top agents can act outside of the ordinary processes intended to establish oversight and accountability at the nations top law enforcement agency. The FBIs adherence to Department of Justice guidelines and instructions from Attorneys General has been a centerpiece of its ongoing independence, often cited by officials as a reason why the FBI does not need a general legislative charter that would restrict or control by statute its authority. Comeys assertion that the FBI can override standard protocols could endanger that independence, according to a former   federal law enforcement official. Hes not only put the credibility of the bureau in doubt, hes now putting the entire basis for our independence in jeopardy, the official said. The official pointed to an editorial in the Wall Street Journal as explaining the dangers of an FBI that decides not to inform the Department of Justice of its activities. Mr. Comey is describing an FBI director who essentially answers to no one. But the police powers of the government are awesome and often abused, and the only way to prevent or correct abuses is to report to elected officials who are accountable to voters. A director must resist intervention to obstruct an investigation, but he and the agency must be politically accountable or risk becoming the FBI of J. Edgar Hoover, the Wall Street Journal wrote. A 2005 report from the FBIs Office of Inspector General on the Department of Justices guidelines for FBI investigations stated, Attorneys General and FBI leadership have uniformly agreed that the Attorney General Guidelines are necessary and desirable, and they have referred to the FBIs adherence to the Attorney General Guidelines as the reason why the FBI should not be subjected to a general legislative charter or to statutory control over the exercise of some of its most intrusive authorities."
Boko Haram Jihadists Slay 15 Civilians in Ramadan Attacks in Northern Nigeria,Breitbart,"Thomas D. Williams, Ph.D.",6/8/2017,"Islamist militants from the Boko Haram terror group killed at least 15 civilians Wednesday night in coordinated attacks including three female suicide bombers in the large city of Maiduguri in northeastern Nigeria. [The militants launched their assault on the citys suburbs with   guns and suicide bombers, said Damian Chukwu, the police commissioner for Borno State. The attack was the most deadly assault by the Boko Haram group in the past year.  At least 14 people were killed in three suicide bombings while another was slain by gunfire in the Jiddari Polo district as local residents tried to flee the assailants. One of the three suicide bombers detonated her explosive belt as Muslims were leaving the mosque in the   neighborhood, killing herself along with six other people. A second bomber blew herself up near the offices of the Development Authorities of Lake Chad at 9:20pm, killing three people in addition to the suicide bomber herself. The third suicide bombing killed one more plus herself, and the three bombings injured an additional 24 people. According to testimonies from eyewitnesses, a group of Boko Haram militants began the attack on the camp of Aridawari, on the outskirts of Maiduguri, around 5:00pm. The attackers arrived in the village carrying heavy weapons and began firing at the houses, said Musa Umara, a resident of Aridawari. Local citizens fled in all directions, he added. The insurgents then traveled to a military base across the   district, shooting at random, according to one resident, Salihu Abdallah. The soldiers stopped them at the Giwa military barracks around 6:30pm, he said. The attacks on the capital city of Borno State took place a day before the interim president Yemi Osinbajo was to inaugurate an important humanitarian project to help feed 1. 8 million displaced persons in the area. Aid agencies have estimated that some 1. 4 million people are affected by an emergency food shortage in the region, with 44, 000 people close to starvation. Last month, one of five Islamist militants released from prison in exchange for 82 high school girls from Chibok, had threatened to carry out a   attack on Maiduguri in a video. The liberation of the Chibok girls, abducted more than three years ago by Boko Haram, as well as the restoration of peace in the Lake Chad district were priorities set by President Muhammadu Buhari on taking office in 2015. Buhari is currently on sick leave in London. Wednesdays assault comes six months after President Muhammadu Buhari said that Boko Haram had technically been defeated, after armed forces forced many of the militants into the remote Sambisa forest, near the border with Cameroon. Boko Haram, which pledged its allegiance to the Islamic State in 2015, has been responsible for more than 20, 000 deaths and 2. 6 million displaced persons since the beginning of this insurrection in 2009, according to reports.

"Police One: Conditioning Britons to Run, Hide, Tell Does Not Demonstrate Resolve",Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/8/2017,"In the wake of the June 3 London Bridge attacks, Police One warns that conditioning Britons to run, hide, tell does not demonstrate resolve. [Instead they show that the tactic reveals an aversion to the use of force in   [which] may embolden       terrorists.   Police One praises the Brits who did what they could to buy time by throwing drink glasses, bar stools, etc. at the London attackers. The response was not without demonstrations of courage. But the overarching mindset of run, hide, tell  instead of Move! Escape or Attack! betrays a conditioning that seeks a means of retreat instead of a means of counteraction it is a response from a position of weakness instead of a position of strength. Police One quotes Winston Churchills 1940 address to the House of Commons: We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our Island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills we shall never surrender. But the word fight does not appear to be in the lexicon of those behind 21st century social and psychological conditioning in Britain.  And this is tragic because some people will be forced to fight for their lives. Police One explains, Yet, in the end, there may be no other alternative for the public but to fight. Running and hiding may work, depending on the circumstances and a persons proximity to the epicenter of an attack, but for some people, there will be no suitable alternative but fighting.  The lack of emphasis on fighting is part of a paradigm that impacts the Metropolitan Police as well. After all, the majority of British police officers are not trusted with lethal force tools and the officers who are actually equipped with firearms operate in a culture where their use is highly discouraged by authorities.  So it comes as not surprise that one of the officers near the June 3 terror attacks had only a club for both an offensive and defensive tool. Police One asks, Is it possible that the British are emboldening these attackers by failing to demonstrate their resolve and their commitment to confronting evil with force? They suggest Churchill would answer in the affirmative. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

"Training doesnt stop harassment: After a stunning string of blows, experts weigh in on how Uber can recover",Business Insider,ine Cain,6/8/2017,"In February, Susan Fowler, a former Uber engineer, published a damning blog post alleging . She described her strange experience at the   startup, which allegedly involved HR ignoring her complaints that her manager was sexually harassing her. That was just the start of Ubers woes.  the startup was hit with further accusations of harassment, as a  report alleged groping and drug use among employees at a company retreat. The stream of bad news may have prompted  including SVP Amit Singhal, who had not disclosed sexual harassment complaints against him from his previous job at Google. As a result of the allegations, Uber launched an internal work misconduct investigation and has enlisted outside law firm Perkins Coie to investigate as well. In addition, US Attorney General Eric Holder is leading a separate investigation specifically focusing on investigating sexual harassment, reporting back to the companys board. So far, 215 claims of various inappropriate workplace incidents including sexual harassment have been investigated, . On Tuesday, Uber fired 20 employees as a result of the investigation and .  tt  And heres a further breakdown of the 215 claims:   But is it enough to fix a culture that led to repeated allegations of harassment? I like the idea that people and organizations can be rehabilitated, says Raleigh, North    Laurie Ruettimann. Im not sure Ive seen that in practice in recent history, but I have to believe its true.  Business Insider spoke with three HR experts to find out the implications of the allegations and resulting investigations for Uber and how the worlds most valuable startup might correct its course going forward.  The HR experts agreed that such a crisis is indicative of  in which harassment and other bad behavior can flourish. Obviously the culture permitted it and allowed it to happen, says  and  president Dr. N. Elizabeth Fried. One would hope that the culture comes out of an evolved level of thinking, but . .. if they were truly a culture that was committed to fairness and equality and that type of situation, they wouldnt be in the position that theyre in.  In other words, in order to permanently fix the problem going forward, the entire culture must change. John Hudson, a   HR business partner with  says that Uber firing employees as a result of the investigation is a smart PR move.  If there is an alleged culture of harassment there, this is a first step, he says. They then need to continue to build on cleaning up the environment and change their hiring practices.  If they are truly serious about changing the culture, then cleaning house is necessary, Hudson says. Have they identified where the issues are? A lot of these culture problems start at the top of an organization. Were they bold enough to make some moves of some bad apples regardless of their performance? Or did they look the other way at some of the talent?   the harassment allegations have proven a problem Uber has been slow to recognize.  Recommendations from the investigations official report are expected to be announced next week, after Ubers staff meeting. The experts had some suggestions on what policies may actually help combat harassment. If there was not a formal investigative process or way for employee complaints to be investigated, a good first step would be to implement one, Hudson says. To do this, he suggests a few things: An Uber spokesperson has said that the company does have a confidential help line, which it will continue to run, as well as a new system in place to better log and track complaints. Ruettimann says that the company needs to look closely at its hiring process to understand what it can do to create better talent pools.  Recruit better, hire better, fire faster, she says. What seems weird is that they havent hired a   HR professional to help them clean house, Ruettimann says. Maybe they dont have any faith in the HR profession. Maybe they dont know anybody who can help them in the trenches. But from developing a diverse talent pool to managing performance, Uber could really use a fresh take on human resources.  An Uber spokesperson told Business Insider that the companys global employee relations team has doubled . Uber announced that, in addition to the 20 terminations, 31 employees are in training and seven have received final warnings about their behavior. In addition to sexual harassment, Perkins Coie investigated claims of unprofessional behavior, bullying, retaliation, physical security, wrongful termination, and other forms of harassment. No action was taken regarding 100 of those claims, and 57 are still under review, . Fried advocates for   training on harassment, specifically breaking down how to identify, report, and investigate harassing behavior. She says that  is not a good excuse. If you keep a blind eye, that doesnt work, Fried says. If youre paying attention, you should have known.   Hudson says that the response needs to go beyond training. If a recommendation is just for some formal sensitivity or civil treatment training, and nothing else, that would be problematic and disappointing, says Hudson. Other initiatives would be less welcome. Im sure theres going to be some recommendation around mentoring women, says Ruettimann. Whenever theres a problem, the answer is always to mentor women.  The problem with mentoring is that it rarely leads anywhere, she says. You can mentor the hell out of a woman, but if you dont have a culture where she can get promoted based on her knowledge, skills or abilities, youve got nothing.  Hudson agreed, saying that Ubers response shouldnt be to simply settle for establishing training and initiatives that the company should have already had in place. Whats more, while the experts agreed that preemptive training is important, Ruettimann thinks its not enough as a method of dealing with harassers: Training doesnt stop harassment. Zero tolerance policies stop harassment.  Im not quite sure how this shakes out for Uber, but nothing ends a culture of harassment quicker than firing the people who harass women and working hard to make sure that it doesnt happen again by promoting more women into leadership roles, Ruettimann says. At the end of the day, if nothing changes, Uber     and other companies facing similar issues     could be in trouble. As things stand now, the lesson is dont work for Uber if youre talented, bright, and you want to associate yourself with a brand that respects people, says . In February, Susan Fowler, a former Uber. .."

Muslim Cleric Convicted for Marrying Child Bride in Australia,Breitbart,Jack Montgomery,6/8/2017,"Ibrahim Omerdic has been convicted for marrying a child bride to a much older man under laws prohibiting forced marriage in Melbourne, Australia. [The    was married to an unnamed man more than twenty years her senior in exchange for a $1, 480 dowry at the Bosnian Islamic Society and Noble Park Mosque, the Herald Sun reports.  A video of the ceremony shows the cleric instructing the girl that, as a wife, you have a duty to obey your husband. The groom, meanwhile, is advised of his obligation to provide the minor with a sexual education. Omerdic seems to appreciate the substantial age difference between the groom and his bride, beginning the undercover proceedings by observing that the bride is very young. Omerdic claimed the ceremony was not a real wedding and he only carried it out so the couple could be seen in public together, and that he had therefore done nothing wrong. However, police discovered a Certificate of Islamic Marriage during their investigation. Magistrate Phillip Goldberg said he it was clear that Omerdic had taken steps to conceal the illegal wedding from the authorities, and he was satisfied the prosecution has proved all elements of the charge. The girls husband has also pleaded guilty to forcing the girl to marry him, as part of a plea deal which saw two other charges, including one for sexual assault, dropped. The Victorian Board of Imams disowned Omerdic in a brief statement: As Australian Muslims we are required to observe and respect the laws of Australia.  The Islamic Council of Victoria said that marriage at a younger age is permitted in other countries and cultures but conceded that this is not a justification for marriage below the legal age or child marriages here in Australia."
Couple indicted in Texas Dennys chokehold death,CNN,Ed Lavandera,6/8/2017,"Houston (CNN) A Texas deputy and her husband could face life in prison after a night out for two Texas families turned into a deadly fight.  John Hernandez kicked and gasped for air when a deputys husband allegedly had him in a chokehold outside a   Dennys restaurant, a video shows. Minutes later, the    father was rushed to the hospital and three days later, he was taken off life support. How the attack unfolded is at the center of the criminal case against Terry Thompson and his wife, Harris County Sheriffs deputy Chauna Thompson.  Thompsons attorney said Terry was acting in   and that a video that was released does not tell the full story of how the altercation unfolded. The couple was indicted on murder charges after Hernandezs death was ruled a homicide by the Harris County medical examiners office, reported CNN affiliate KTRK.  They were in custody late Thursday night and released on bond early Friday, according to the Harris County Sheriffs office. What happened? It was just after 11 p. m. on May 28 when Terry Thompson verbally confronted Hernandez for urinating outside a Dennys restaurant in Northeast Harris County, the sheriffs office said. A physical altercation ensued, the sheriffs office said. After being confronted with urinating in public, he rushed to my client and struck him in the face. Now, I would consider that an attack, said Thompsons attorney, Scot Courtney.   As Thompson, 41, brought Hernandez to the ground, a man walked outside the restaurant and started recording the incident.  A   video shows Thompson on top of Hernandez locking him in a chokehold while his wife, who was off duty, pins Hernandezs left arm to the ground.   As Hernandez kicks and gasps for air, Thompson tells Hernandez, Do you want me to hit you again? Do you want me to hit you again? Then two unknown people try to block the bystander from recording more of the scene. At one point a woman screams, Its illegal to record.  Several seconds later the recording stops. Under Texas law, individuals are allowed to videotape others without their permission in public spaces with the exception of dressing rooms and bathrooms, but only if its not for sexual purposes.   Hernandezs wife, Maria Toral, and her daughter were inside the restaurant when the incident began and rushed outside, yelling at the Thompsons to release Hernandez. The little daughter was screaming, Quit hitting my daddy, their attorney, Randall Kallinen, said. Courtney claims Thompson was acting in  . My client was trying to subdue him, Courtney said. Thats all he was doing.  When Hernandez stopped resisting, the Thompsons noticed that he was not breathing, a statement from the Harris County Sheriffs Office said. Before he was taken to the hospital, the statement says, Chauna Thompson performed CPR on Hernandez. The autopsy report said Hernandezs death was a homicide and that he died from anoxic encephalopathy caused by strangulation by chest compression, reported CNN affiliate KPRC. We are not done For Hernandezs aunt, Wendy Maldonado, the indictment is just a first step toward justice, she said. We are not asking for the death penalty for the Thompson family. We are only asking for life in prison, Maldonado told reporters. Family and friends will be holding a wake Friday to honor Hernandez. He will be buried Saturday after a mass and graveside service, according to a Houston area funeral home. Randall Kallinen, an attorney for the Hernandez family, told a crowd of supporters Thursday night they need to remain vigilant. We are not done, though, because no one has been convicted of anything, he said. Kallinen told CNN affiliate KTRK that the family was pleased with the district attorneys office, which he praised as swift and thorough. It does raise questions for us The case has sparked outrage and allegations that Thompson received preferential treatment from his wifes law enforcement colleagues. Kallinen said Hernandezs wife was put in a police squad car for nearly four hours and had her cell phone taken away by deputies at the scene. The night of the altercation, deputies considered filing assault charges against Hernandez because the case had been reported as an assault, not a homicide, said Tom Berg, first assistant district attorney for Harris County. Officers at the scene did not tell prosecutors Hernandez was unconscious and being rushed to a hospital for treatment, according to the district attorneys office.  Prosecutors say homicide investigators were not called to the scene because Hernandez didnt die of his injuries until several days later. The prosecutor said homicide investigators are better trained to question witnesses and collect evidence from crime scenes.  It does raise questions for us, Berg said. We are concerned that things happened later than they should have, but we have a complete picture now. We will show no favoritism. We will let the chips fall as they may with the grand jury, Berg added. On Wednesday, Harris County Sheriff Ed Gonzalez said the agency has asked the Department of Justice and Texas Rangers to review the investigation.  From the beginning we have promised a fair, thorough and transparent investigation, Gonzalez told reporters.   He said Chauna Thompson has been removed from her patrol duties and moved to an administrative job within the department until the investigation concludes. Hernandezs family and friends gathered Wednesday in a march and rally to demand justice and urge the arrests of the Thompsons. This should not have happened, and the fact that it did happen shows that there are things that need to be fixed within the sheriffs department, Oscar Hernandez told CNN affiliate KTRK. Correction: A previous version of this story misspelled the first name of Harris County Sheriffs Deputy Chauna Thompson."

English Multiculturalism Has Lost Its Head: Charlie Hebdo Satirises Britains Response to Terror,Breitbart,Oliver JJ Lane,6/8/2017,"French political magazine Charlie Hebdo has published a   cartoon of British Prime Minister Theresa May holding her own severed head and a number of other drawings satirising Britains response to terror in its latest edition. [The satirical magazine, which saw much of its editorial staff slaughtered by Islamist gunmen in a 2015 terror attack, has taken aim at Britains response to a spate of recent attacks, which have seen bomb and knife attacks successfully launched against civilians and police officers.  Theresa May on the front of Charlie Hebdo in France  pic. twitter.

Apparently speaking after a beheading attack     the likes of which were attempted by the Lee Rigby murder killers and during more recent attacks     the prime minister says too much is too much! The prime minister also told journalists after Saturdays London Bridge attack of terrorism that now enough is enough and that there is far too much tolerance of Islamism in the United Kingdom. A social media post accompanying the new edition advertises the content, remarking: This week, English multiculturalism no longer has the head on his shoulders.  Other cartoons in this weeks edition of Charlie Hebdo include a rendition of Londoners fleeing from a terror attack     including the iconic image of a man escaping whilst carrying a pint of beer. Combining this imagery with   trends, the caption reads simply: Slimming tips from the Islamic State: run fast! The magazine also took aim at those who in the wake of the 2015 gun attack on Charlie Hebdo, apparently launched because the magazine had repeatedly published cartoons of Mohammed, said the staff may have brought the attack upon themselves by offending Muslims. A drawing of two apparently stereotypical Brits is captioned: At least one never caricatured the Prophet.  The new edition of Charlie Hebdo, which hits the shelves as Britain votes in the general election, follows a French election edition that poked fun at the age gap between newly elected President Emmanuel Macron, and his wife, who was a former teacher of his when he was at school. Noting the messianic quality attached to young, ascendant   politicians like Macron, the cartoon showed the    woman pregnant with the caption Hes going to work miracles!"
Former FBI Director Comey: Trump told me he had not been involved with Russian hookers,Business Insider,Jeremy Berke,6/8/2017,"Former FBI Director James Comey will tell the Senate Intelligence   Committee on Thursday that President Donald Trump told him he   had not been involved with Russian hookers, according to    which the committee published on   Wednesday.     The exchange occurred during a phone call on March 30 from Trump   to Comey at his FBI office, according to the remarks.     Trump described the Russia investigation as  that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the   country, Comeys remarks say. He said he had nothing to do with   Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had   always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.     A dossier prepared by a former British intelligence official that   alleged ties between the Trump campaign and Russia contained an   unverified claim that  to perform lewd acts in a Moscow     presidential suite. Trump has publicly dismissed the dossier as   fake news.     Comey said in his remarks that during a dinner on January 27,   Trump expressed his disgust for the allegations and said he was   considering ordering Comey to investigate the alleged incident   to prove it didnt happen. Comey said he told Trump that   ordering such an investigation might create a narrative that   the FBI was investigating him personally, which it wasnt, and   that it was very difficult to prove a negative, according to   the remarks.

Heres what James Comey will tell Congress in his first testimony since being fired,Business Insider,Natasha Bertrand,6/8/2017,"Former FBI Director James Comey will tell the Senate Intelligence   Committee on Thursday that President Donald Trump asked him for   his loyalty during a dinner in January and requested in an Oval   Office meeting in February that he drop the FBIs investigation   into former national security adviser Michael Flynn.     At the January 27 dinner, the president began by asking me   whether I wanted to stay on as FBI director, which I found   strange because he had already told me twice in earlier   conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him   that I intended to, Comey said in his prepared remarks, which   the committee published Wednesday.     My instincts told me that the    setting, and the   pretense that this was our first discussion about my position,   meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask   for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship, the   remarks say. That concerned me greatly, given the FBIs   traditionally independent status in the executive branch.     Comey, whom Trump fired on May 9, wrote in the remarks that he   told Trump he loved his work and intended to stay and serve out   my   term as director. . .. I added that I was not on   anybodys side politically and could not be counted on in the   traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best   interest as the president.     A few moments later, the president said, I need loyalty. I   expect loyalty, Comey continued. I didnt move, speak, or   change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence   that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The   conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near   the end of our dinner.      According to the prepared remarks, Comey will also tell Congress   about his conversation with Trump during an Oval Office meeting   on February 14 in which Trump told him he wanted to talk about   Flynn, who had resigned the day before.     The president began by saying Flynn hadnt done anything wrong   in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because   he had misled the vice president, Comeys remarks say. He added   that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then   specify.     He is a good guy and has been through a lot, Comey recalls   Trump saying of Flynn. He repeated that Flynn hadnt done   anything wrong on his calls with the Russians but had misled the   vice president. He then said, I hope you can see your way clear   to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope   you can let this go.      Comeys prepared remarks say he told Trump that he agreed Flynn   was a good guy, but that he did not tell the president that he   would drop the investigation. He did, however, reassure Trump   that he was not the direct subject of the FBIs   counterintelligence investigation.     Still, according to Comeys prepared testimony, Trump called him   at least twice more, on March 30 and April 11, to discuss the   Russia investigation.     On the morning of March 30, the president called me at the FBI.   He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was   impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country, Comeys   remarks say. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not   been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he   was being recorded when in Russia.     Comey, along with the director of the National Security Agency,   Mike Rogers, had testified the week before that the FBI was   investigating whether there was any coordination between the   Trump campaign and Russian officials during the election.     I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as   we could and that there would be great benefit, if we didnt   find anything, to our having done the work well, Comeys remarks   say. He agreed, but then   the problems this was   causing him.     On April 11, Trump called Comey again, according to the prepared   testimony, to ask what the FBI director had done to tell the   public that Trump himself was not under investigation.     I replied that I had passed his request to the acting deputy   attorney general, but I had not heard back, Comeys remarks say.   He replied that the cloud was getting in the way of his   ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his   people reach out to the acting deputy attorney general. I said   that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White   House counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the   request, which was the traditional channel.     The  leading   Trump to fire Comey appears to have been the presidents    after Comey confirmed in an open     and televised     hearing before   the Senate Judiciary Committee that the FBI was still   investigating whether the Trump campaign had colluded with   Russia.     Comey had not allowed the White House to preview that testimony,   which Trump and his aides considered an act of insubordination,   . The New York Times  saying Trump was broadly irked by his   inability to gain assurances of loyalty from Comey.     Comey will testify one day after the Senate Intelligence   Committee grilled top intelligence officials about the   circumstances surrounding his firing.     Democratic Sen. Mark Warner told the officials     National   Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, acting FBI Director Andrew   McCabe, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and Director of   National Intelligence Dan Coats     that it was jarring to hear   recent reports of White House officials, perhaps even the   president himself, attempting to influence and enlist our     leaders in attempting to undermine an   ongoing FBI investigation.

James Comey: Loretta Lynch Tried to Influence Statements on Hillary Clinton Investigation,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/8/2017,"Former FBI Director James Comey revealed that former President Obamas Attorney General Loretta Lynch tried to influence his statements on Hillary Clintons email investigation during the election. [At one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it investigation, but instead to call it a matter, which concerned and confused me, Comey said.  Comey made his remarks during a Senate hearing, offering testimony about the ongoing investigation into Russias attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election and the decision by former President Donald Trump to fire him. He acknowledged during the hearing that there were other reasons why he felt he had to make the statement about Clintons investigation, including one significant reason, which had to remain classified. He said that Lynchs meeting on the tarmac with former president Bill Clinton during the campaign was the ultimate reason why he decided to make a public statement when the department decided not to prosecute Hillary Clinton. In a ultimately conclusive way, that was the thing that capped it for me, that I had to do something separately to protect the credibility of the investigation, which meant both the FBI and the Justice Department, he said. Comey confessed that he followed Lynchs advice, admitting that he could have resisted more. I just said this isnt a hill worth dying on and so I just said, O. K., Comey said, but added that he was concerned that the Clinton campaign was referring to the investigation with the same language."
James Comeys Opening Remarks: Its All About Him - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/8/2017,"Former FBI director James Comey opened his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by complaining about shifting explanations for why he had been fired, and by attacking the Trump administration. [Comey said that he had originally intended to accept his firing quietly, but then found that the administrations statements about the matter confused me and increasingly concerned me.  He said that President Donald Trump had assured him that he was doing a good job, and that he had assured the president in return that he intended to stay.  I was extremely   by the FBI workforce, Comey said. So it confused me when I saw on television the president saying that he actually fired me because of the Russia investigation.  Under questioning, Comey would later admit that the president did not ask him to stop the Russia investigation, an admission already contained in Comeys prepared written testimony. Comey continued: I was also confused by the initial explanation that was offered publicly: that I was fired because of the decisions I had made during the election year.  He had assumed that was water        under the bridge, he said. The administration then chose to defame me, and more importantly the FBI, by saying that the organization was in disarray, that it was poorly led, that the workforce had lost confidence in its leader. Those were lies, plain and simple, and I am so sorry that the FBI workforce had to hear them, and Im so sorry that the American people were told them.  Comey closed his remarks by offering words of praise for his former colleagues at the FBI. But his remarks left little doubt that his motivations for testifying were deeply personal. And they created an impression that he intended to exact a political price from the president for doing what he acknowledged the president had every right to do. Joel B.

James Comey Hearing Destroys Obstruction of Justice Case Against Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/8/2017,"Former FBI director James Comey began his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee on Thursday by suggesting that the question of whether President Donald Trump had committed obstruction of justice was one for Special Counsel Robert Mueller to investigate. [But under questioning by Sen. James Risch ( ) Comey all but destroyed any hope Democrats had for bringing a case of obstruction of justice against President Donald Trump.  Their exchange was as follows: Risch: I want to drill right down, as my time is limited, to the most recent   regarding, allegations that the President of the United States obstructed justice. And, boy, you nailed this down on page page five, paragraph three, you put this in quotes. Words matter, you wrote down the words so we can all have the words in front of us now. Theres 28 words that are in quotes, and it says, quote: I hope     this is the president speaking     I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  Now, those are his exact words is that correct? Comey: Correct. Risch: And you wrote them here and you put them in quotes. Comey: Correct. Risch: Thank you for that. He did not direct you to let it go. Comey: Not in his words, no. Risch: He did not order you to let it go. Comey: Again, those words are not in order. Risch: No. He said, I hope.  Now, like me, you probably did hundreds of cases, maybe thousands of cases, charging people with criminal offenses. And of course you have knowledge of the thousands of cases out there where people have been charged. Do you know of any case where a person has been charged for obstruction of justice or for that matter any other criminal offense where they said or thought they hoped for an outcome? Comey: I dont know well enough to answer. And the reason I keep saying his words is, I took it as a direction. Risch: Right. Comey: I mean, its the President of the United States with me alone, saying, I hope this.  I took it as this is what he wants me to do. I didnt obey that, but thats the way I took it. Risch: You may have taken it as a direction, but thats not what he said. Comey: Correct. Risch: He said, I hope.  Comey: Those are exact words, correct. Risch: You dont know of anyone thats been charged for hoping something? Comey: I dont, as I sit here. Risch: Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Democrats have hinged their hopes for impeachment     and reversing the 2016 elections     on the idea that Trump committed obstruction of justice. That case has now been smashed beyond repair.

It was not true, Comey said. Again, all of you know this, maybe the American people dont. The challenge     Im not picking on reporters about writing stories about classified information       [the challenge is] that people talking about it often dont really now whats going on and those of us who actually know whats going on are not talking about it.

[I was alone with the president of the United States, or the   soon to be president, Comey said when asked why he documented his meetings with Trump. The subject matter        I was talking about matters that touch on the FBIs core responsibility and it related to the   personally and then the nature of the person, I was honestly concerned he might lie about the nature of our meeting so I thought it [was] important to document        that combination of things.   Comey also said that he did not feel the need to document his conversations about intelligence with former Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. As I said in my written testimony as FBI director, I interacted with President Obama and spoke only twice in three years and didnt document it, Comey said. When I was deputy attorney general I had one    meeting with President Bush about a national security matter. I didnt document that conversation either, Comey said."

Nine Times James Comey Testified He Could Be Wrong at Russia Probe Hearing - Breitbart,Breitbart,Aaron Klein,6/8/2017,"During Thursdays Senate Select Committee on Intelligence hearing, former FBI Director James Comey stated nine times that he could be wrong on various matters, including central points in the probe of alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [Here are each of those nine times, presented in the order of Comeys testimony:  1     Asked by Sen. Mark Warner to clarify Comeys claim that he believed President Trump was seeking to create some sort of patronage relationship by inviting him to a    dinner at the White House, Comey offered his response with the qualification that he could be wrong.  He stated: Well, my impression, and again its my impression, I could always be wrong but my common sense told me what was going on is, either he had concluded or someone had told him that you didnt, youve already asked Comey to stay, and you didnt get anything for it. And that the dinner was an effort to build a relationship, in fact, he asked specifically, of loyalty in the context of asking me to stay. 2     Comey used the wrong qualification when he further interpreted Trumps intentions at the same dinner: My common sense, again I could be wrong but my common sense told me whats going on here is, hes looking to get something in exchange for granting my request to stay in the job. 3     Comey said he could be wrong about his interpretation of an instance on January 6 in which Trump allegedly asked Comey to speak with him alone after a meeting at a conference room at Trump Tower. My impression was something big is about to happen. I need to remember every single word that is spoken, and again, I could be wrong, Im 56 years old, Ive been, seen a few things, my sense was the attorney general knew he shouldnt be leaving which was why he was leaving and I dont know Kushner well but I think he picked up on the same thing so I knew something was about to happen that I needed to pay very close attention to. 4     Asked why he thought he was fired from his position as FBI chief, Comey replied: I guess I dont know for sure. I believe     I think the president, at his word, that I was fired because of the Russia investigation. Something about the way I was conducting it, the president felt created pressure on him that he wanted to relieve. Again, I didnt know that at the time. I watched his interview. I read the press accounts of his conversations. I take him at his word there. Look, I could be wrong. Maybe hes saying something thats not true. I take him at his word, at least based on what I know now. 5     Comey was asked to interpret a statement that he claims Trump made to him in private in which the   director claims Trump stated about an FBI probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn that I hope you could see your way to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  Comey stated: Well, the context and the presidents word are what led me to that conclusion. As I said in my statement, I could be wrong, but Flynn had been forced to resign the day before. And the controversy around general Flynn at that point in time was centered on whether he lied to the vice president about his nature of conversations with the Russians, whether he had been candid with others in the course of that. So that happens on the day before. On the 1, the president makes reference to that. I understood what he wanted me to do was drop any investigation connected to Flynns account of his conversations with the Russians. 6     Comey was asked about a March 30 phone call in which he claims Trump asked him what the FBI could do to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation, which Comey says Trump described as impeding the presidents ability to govern. He replied: I think what he meant by the cloud     and, again, I could be wrong     but the entire investigation is taking up oxygen and making it hard for me to focus on what I want to focus on. The ask was to get it out that I, the president, am not personally under investigation. 7     Comey was asked whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions was aware of concerns about Flynn at the time Sessions was sworn in to the attorney general position. I dont as I sit here, Comey responded. I dont recall that he was. I could be wrong, but I dont remember that he was.  8     Asked whether he had conversations with Trump about the Russia threat that suggested the president was taking that hostile action seriously, Comey replied: I dont remember any interactions with the president other than the initial briefing on January the 6th. I dont remember     could be wrong, but I dont remember any conversations with him at all about that. 9     Comey stated he could have the date wrong regarding an alleged phone call from Trump: There was another phone call that I mentioned could have the date wrong, March 1st, where he called just to check in with me as I was about to get on the hospital.

Kristen Stewart: We Must Shatter Idea That Playing With Toy Guns Is Cool,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/8/2017,"During the June 7 Brady Center Bear Awards   where celebrities applaud other celebrities for their gun control support   actress Kristen Stewart warned that it is time to dispel the idea that playing with toy guns is cool. [The awards ceremony honored Chelsea Handler, who refers to gun ownership as a hobby rather than a right, and were attended by January Jones, Tom Arnold, and The Voice champion Alisan Porter. Will Ferrell also attended and served as auctioneer for the evening.  According to People, Stewarts attendance was highlighted by Dan Gross, president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. Gross said Stewart had approached him with an idea about a new way to push gun control and that he was impressed by her proposal. He said, She came to us because she has something she wants to do with this issue. She eagerly shared her idea and without hesitation and is showing up tonight. She is committed to actually doing something, not just lending her name.  While no specifics were given about Stewarts gun control idea, People reports that it will revolve around taking classic American depictions of our fascination with guns and adding a new message. Stewart spoke about using images to change the way Americans perceive what is considered to be comforting.  And talked about how we need to work to keep children from playing with toy guns because it convinces them that real guns can offer protection when they grow up: One of them involved the shattering of the idea that its cool to play with toy guns and little kids grow up thinking thats going to protect and empower them. We kind of take that idea and go, Actually this is something else that could happen, and that needs to be considered by people who might not think about that kind of thing. Stewarts filmography includes American Ultra, a film about an unorthodox government agent who has to fight for his life after being targeted for death.

A normal White House on a day like today would have, you know, former attorney general and people in law enforcement sort of making legal arguments.

Zuhdi Jasser: Apologists for Radical Islam Coddle the Muslim Community,Breitbart,John Hayward,6/8/2017,"Dr. Zuhdi Jasser, founder and president of the American Islamic Forum for Democracy, joined SiriusXM host Raheem Kassam on Thursdays Breitbart News Daily to talk about the aftermath of the London Bridge terror attack, and the future of Britains struggle against radical Islamic terrorism. [Kassam commiserated with Jasser about the difficulties of being a Muslim reformer in a media environment where stern criticism of Islam, even from Muslims, is treated like racism.  Jasser said apologists for Islams excesses were basically doing takfir on national television, using the Muslim term for disinformation. My response is, Im proud not to be part of their Islamist community, but these guys talk about Muslims like were a gang, he said. Like they own the gang, and we cant participate, when in fact they want to shut down free speech, they want to deny that were a diverse community.  When people say why do these radical attacks keep happening? its because the free world refuses to treat Muslims like adults, said Jasser. They want to coddle the Muslim community, use them for partisan purposes and identity politics, and ignore all of the signs and precursors of radicalization     which are, by the way, the signs are hallmarks of the principles of our free society.   Equality of men and women, respect for free speech, a denial of conspiracy theories, ownership of who we are     all of these principles, which are basic principles of human rights, in order to coddle Muslims they allow the Islamic supremacists, the sharia supremacists to speak for our community, he elaborated.  Meanwhile, they are basically telling Muslims like myself who love America, who want to stand up for our country, Oh, go sit at the back of the bus. You dont deserve any recognition. Were going to let the men with the long beards and the apologists basically speak for your community. Its bigoted. It is them who are the bigots. We are being told we dont love our faith, when in fact its the tough love of Muslims like myself that really, I believe, should be honored in a free society, said Jasser. Kassam asked if the wave of terrorist attacks was a direct result of allowing Islamists and their apologists to dominate the conversation at the expense of reformists like Jasser, sometimes equating reformist criticism with apostasy. It definitely is, Jasser replied. ISIS, the Islamic State, is not only ISIS. Every one of the Islamic states of the 56   countries that form the Organization of Islamic Cooperation is based on a sharia state platform. That sharia state basically says that you need to follow the laws as determined by the clerics who define what is and is not Islam, what is and is not permitted speech. If you dont fit in that construct, then you are not a Muslim. Therefore, how do you control that state? You control it by limited free speech and rejecting those who fall outside the confines of their theocracy.  People need to understand, political Islams goal is not to dominate   countries, but to evangelize, spread their ideas globally and defeat secular states, defeat   states, he warned. They divide the world into the land of Islam and the land of War.  We in the West, by virtue of not evangelizing liberty, being offensive in pushing back     not only against terror, which is a symptom, but against the theocratic ideology of political Islam     are being sheepish. Appeasing, if you will. By not pushing for our ideas of universal human rights, we have been basically unarmed, and were starting to see a sonic boom of the lack of assimilation, he said.  Those within our society that are Islamists reject who we are. When Britain looks and says wow, theres almost more jihadis from Britain going to Syria than there are Muslims loving Britain and serving in their own military     just look at the numbers. It should be 99 percent for one, serving in the British military, versus going to jihad. It is almost 50 to 50. That is why were losing this war, said Jasser. Kassam asked how adherents of a Westernized Muslim could reconcile themselves to the portions of Koranic doctrine that conflict with Western ideals, such as freedom of speech. Thats a great question, especially now in this month of Ramadan where we fast and reflect, and seek atonement and humility, Jasser replied. The Islam that I believe in and teach my kids is a personal faith. Its not up to the government. Its not up to the imam who is the teacher. I can talk to five, six imams and then make up my seventh decision, some different decision.  Remember, what people read as the Koran is interpretation. The only thing that is Koran is the Arabic. The battle over interpretation is, what are the original words in Arabic? How do we actually define them? Many of them are fake and intentionally misleading interpretations, he argued.  The others that are about wars and battles, we need to separate and say, You know what? Maybe it made sense in 620, 625 C. E. but we need to circumscribe those and say we no longer apply to today. You have to separate the historical part of the passages from applies to today, he advised. Muslims have done that with the rejection of polygamy thats permitted, with the rejection of the cutting of hands for stealing, things like that. Theres a way to separate those things, and other ways to reinterpret.  As a much more delicate example, Jasser noted there is a passage in the Koran about the permissibility of beating women, but he suggested it could be reinterpreted in a modern context as going on strike (i. e. separating from her) instead of physically striking her. There are modern ways to reinterpret the exact same words in a     more modern liberal way while staying true to the authenticity of the script, he stressed, referring to two schools of Islam that reject modernization and insist on highly literal interpretations of the Koran.

But I understand the committee has been briefed on the classified facts. Probably the only other consideration I guess can talk about in an open setting is at one point the attorney general had directed me not to call it an investigation but instead to call it matter, which confused me and concerned me.

Sessions Resigning Narrative Gets Another Blow with White House Vow of Confidence - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ian Mason,6/8/2017,"CNNs Jim Acosta tweeted Thursday that Principal Deputy White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dispelled rumors of a rift between Attorney General Jeff Sessions and President Donald Trump. [President has confidence in Sessions, Sarah Sanders tells reporters.     Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,   Sanders said she had a conversation with POTUS last night about Sessions.     Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 8, 2017,  Sanderss statement to Acosta and other reporters came after days of mainstream media promotion of rumors from unnamed White House sources that the Attorney General and the President have been at loggerheads and that Sessions had even offered his resignation. Acosta noted the over 48 hours that passed between the report and Sanderss rebuke, the first official White House refutation of the idea that Sessions might be on his way out for having criticized the president. The Daily Callers Alex Pfeiffer, however, reported Wednesday that multiple sources close to the Attorney General found the insinuation of his demise ridiculous. Hes not going anywhere, one official who spoke with Sessions in the aftermath of the reports told the Caller. Much of the media speculation was based on Trumps supposed disagreement with the Justice Department on litigation strategy in the upcoming Supreme Court appeal on the validity of the Presidents executive order travel ban for six Muslim majority countries. The President made tweets defending the original ban over what he called the   second version, which was drafted with closer supervision from Attorney General Sessionss Justice Department. Sessions, however, has been a prime media target within the administration since before he was even confirmed as Attorney General in contentious hearings that saw Sen. Elizabeth Warren ( ) make   attacks on   Sessions that saw her reprimanded. The campaign against Sessions, from both Democratic elected officials and the   activist establishment, has only intensified since administration blood entered the water with National Security Advisor Michael Flynns ouster. In March, Senate Democrats renewed their calls for Sessions to resign over his inaccurate statements about meeting with Russian officials in the course of his official business as a U. S. Senator. The drums beating for resignation were quickly joined by the Democratic National Committee and George Soross leftist agitation vehicle Moveon. org. This weeks rumors of resignation began after a relative lull in the pressure from the left on Sessions. His central role in enforcing President Trumps agenda on immigration and crime, however, continue to make him a focal point of leftist ire."
"Pentagon: China to Expand Military Bases in Pakistan, Other Allied Countries",Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/8/2017,"China will most likely try to expand its military footprint in countries that share Beijings strategic interests and have long been considered its ally, namely Pakistan, as the communist country increases its power projection into the Indian Ocean, reports the Pentagon in an annual report to the U. S. Congress. [In the   report issued Tuesday, the U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) warns under a subsection titled Military Cooperation:  As Chinas regional and international interests grow more complex, the PLAs [Peoples Liberation Army] international engagement will continue to expand, especially in the areas of PKO [peacekeeping operations] counterpiracy,   [humanitarian   relief, counterterrorism, and joint exercises. The Pentagon later adds that China most likely will seek to establish additional military bases in countries with which it has a longstanding friendly relationship and similar strategic interests, such as Pakistan, and in which there is a precedent for hosting foreign militaries.  In August 2016, Beijing reached a military counterterrorism pact with Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan. Beijing believes terrorism, primarily stemming from Pakistan and, to a lesser extent,   Afghanistan, poses a threat to Chinas One Belt, One Road (OBOR) initiative, known as the 21st Century Silk Road project. As of 2015, China was the globes   arms supplier, with Pakistan being one of its top customers. Pakistan receives more weapons from China than any other country. China is one of only a few global suppliers of such [armed unmanned aerial vehicles     UAV] equipment and faces little competition for sales to the Middle East and North Africa, notes the Pentagon. This likely will result in the Middle East and North Africa surpassing   Africa as Chinas second largest arms export market.  Pakistan and China, which consider India to be their regional foe, have agreed on the construction of the estimated $55 billion   Economic Corridor (CPEC) a component of Beijings nearly $1 trillion modern Silk Road, officially known as Chinese President Xi Jinpings OBOR initiative. It appears China is using its OBOR project as justification to expand its military footprint to many of the 60 countries in Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and Africa that are involved in the ambitious project. Leaked documents recently obtained by Pakistans DAWN purportedly revealed that Beijing is planning to use CPEC to suppress Islamic terrorism, diversity, and democracy in its   ally. It appears China is seeking to expand its military might beyond neighboring Pakistan and Afghanistan across various other countries. Chinas overseas military basing may be constrained by the willingness of countries to support a PLA [Peoples Liberation Army] presence in one of their ports, it adds. Pakistan, the top recipient of Chinese weapons as well as other military assistance and foreign aid, is already collaborating with Beijings military ambitions. With Pakistans blessing, China has deployed naval ships to the Singapore   Gwadar Sea Port to safeguard the port and trade under the   Economic Corridor. From Gwadar port, Chinas area of operation would include a region from the Arabian Sea to the African coast, and, of course, the Gulf would be its area of operation. India is opposed to Chinas plan to set up military bases within its periphery. Nevertheless, China has already begun to establish military bases in the Indian Ocean, namely Djibouti and in the Gwadar port in Pakistans Balochistan province. As has been Beijings policy for a long time, Chinas goal is to isolate India. In the Indian Ocean, China intends to construct a military base network that would include Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, the Seychelles, and Djibouti, among others. The Pentagon reports: In May 2016, a large PLAN [PLA Navy] task force conducted an extensive deployment through the South China Sea, eastern Indian Ocean, and Western Pacific Ocean. The force conducted island assault training in the Spratly Islands and maritime interdiction training in the Indian Ocean before linking up to conduct an   exercise in the Philippine Sea. DoD also notes: China also continued to send submarines to the Indian Ocean, ostensibly in support of its counterpiracy patrols. In May 2016, a   powered attack submarine conducted a port call in Karachi, Pakistan, during a visit by the PLAN Commander, marking Chinas first port call in South Asia by a nuclear submarine. These submarine patrols demonstrate the PLANs emerging capability both to protect Chinas SLOCs [sea lines of communication] and to increase Chinas power projection into the Indian Ocean. In what seems to be a pushback to Chinas ambitious OBOR project, India and Japan are embarking upon multiple infrastructure projects across Africa, Iran, Sri Lanka, and Southeast Asia. Last month, the Economic Times noted, India has conspicuously stayed away from the   New Silk Road, launched with much fanfare by Chinese President Xi Jinping on Sunday, because of strategic and security concerns.  The   Economic Corridor is expected to run through the disputed   Kashmir (POK) a move that will certainly cause tension with India since New Delhi claims ownership of the region. China considers the growing Islamic terrorism threat it is facing to stem from Pakistan and to a lesser extent Afghanistan, according to the U. S.  Economic and Security Review Commission. Beijing and Kabul have already signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to integrate Afghanistan into the 21st Century Silk Road.   Kashmir and Afghanistan border Chinas autonomous and largest Xinjiang province, home to the countrys Muslim Uighur minority."

German Police Chief Claims Asylum Seekers Using Christian Conversion to Avoid Deportation,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/8/2017,"Braunschweiger Criminal Police chief Ulf Kche has claimed many migrants are tricking the German government when they convert to Christianity and others have called for more stringent standards regarding migrant conversions. [Police chief and   of the Federal German Criminal Police Office Ulf Kche made the remarks after the news of the brutal killing of a    child in an asylum home over the weekend, Tag 24 reports.  The asylum seeker who killed the child, and was later shot by police, turned out to have converted to Christianity to avoid deportation after having committed arson years before. Kche said: If the deportation of the offender has failed because he has changed his faith, then one has to put two and two together.  He claimed that asylum seekers were just using Christianity as a cover to avoid being deported from Germany. Muslims arent allowed to change their faith, he added. A lot has to happen that Muslims would abandon their religion.  The evangelical regional bishop of Hannover, Ralf Meister agrees with Kche and has made it clear that more needs to be done to confirm that conversions are legitimate and not just done to avoid expulsion. Abusive, frail baptisms can not be tolerated, Meister said. It is the task of state courts to take decisive action against this form of abuse, the bishop added but did not state any proposals to identify abuses in the system. Viktor Pfaff,   of the   charity   said the case of the migrant who killed the    was extreme and cited the European human rights rules saying that no migrant should be deported to their homeland if they will face possible persecution due to their religious beliefs. Adult baptisms in neighbouring Austria have also increased largely due to the many migrants who have converted from Islam to Christianity over the course of the migrant crisis.  The Austrian Roman Catholic church said the figure had doubled since last year. Whilst many migrants have fled to Europe specifically because they wanted to convert to Christianity, others have admitted they converted to help their chances at an asylum claim. Earlier this year, Muslim Syrians living at a refugee camp in Lebanon said they knew many migrants converting for asylum reasons. One Syrian named Ibrahim Ali said: A lot of people are doing it to get to Europe, the U. S. and Canada. While I plan to stay in Lebanon, I know hundreds who been baptised just to help their applications. They would do anything to have security for their family."

Accused leaker Reality Winner pleads not guilty,CNN,Nick Valencia,6/8/2017,"Augusta, Georgia (CNN) Reality Winner pleaded not guilty in federal court Thursday to one charge in connection with removing classified material from a government facility and giving it to an unauthorized person. She was denied bail. The    federal contractor was charged with leaking information regarding a 2016 Russian military intelligence cyberattack to The Intercept, an online news outlet. She is accused of revealing classified information, used as the basis for an article published Monday by The Intercept, which detailed a classified National Security Agency memo. The NSA report, dated May 5, provides details of a 2016 Russian cyberattack on a US voting software supplier, though there is no evidence the hack affected any votes. Assistant US Attorney Jennifer Solari said it is unclear how much material is involved in the case. Authorities are looking at two laptops, a tablet and four cellphones seized from Winners home as well as   notebooks. The charge, willful retention and transmission of national defense information, could bring Winner up to 10 years in prison. She could also face a fine of up to $250, 000. Winner, dressed in an orange jumpsuit with the word Inmate on the back, spoke very little to Judge Brian Epps. She stood with her hands behind her back and said, Yes, your honor when asked whether she has gotten a lawyer. Solari told the judge that Winner had admitted to FBI agents during her arrest that she sought out classified information. According to Solari she told them she was mad about what she had recently seen in the media and she wanted to set the facts right. The US attorney also alleged that Winner once searched on her work computer, while she was still in the Air Force, for the phrase: Do top secret computers detect when flash drives are inserted? And there was a notation in one notebook, Solari said in which Winner purportedly wrote, I want to burn the White House down. Winners mother, Billie   told the court her daughter had never been in any trouble and was at the top of her class throughout her school days.  Her stepfather said Reality Winner never expressed unpatriotic thoughts and is a good person. Twitter posts curtailed while at new job  The Intercept provided the US government agency with a copy of the document, according to the complaint. The news outlet later said it did not know the identity of the person who gave it the document.  Winner served in the Air Force from December 2010 to 2016, leaving as a senior airman who was a cryptologic language analyst. She provided support to missions and received the Air Force Commendation Medal in 2016, which is for members who have distinguished themselves by meritorious achievement and service.  Recently she was a contractor with Pluribus International Corp. in Augusta, Georgia. On Twitter, Winner posted about leaks and regularly took to social media to blast President Donald Trump, though her Twitter activity dropped off significantly after she began working for Pluribus in February. Winner posted under a pseudonym, Sara Winners, but didnt seem concerned with concealing her identity, using a photo of herself as a profile picture and posting a selfie in February. Winner followed Edward Snowden, WikiLeaks, several accounts with links to the hacking collective Anonymous, and several alt government agency accounts that became popular after Trumps inauguration. Many of the accounts claim to be run by agency employees unhappy with Trump."
U.S. Wrestles With How to Fight Back Against Cyberattacks - The New York Times,New York Times,David E. Sanger,6/8/2017,"ASPEN, Colo.     It has been an open secret throughout the Obama presidency that world powers have escalated their use of cyberpower. But the recent revelations of hacking into Democratic campaign computer systems in an apparent attempt to manipulate the 2016 election is forcing the White House to confront a new question: whether, and if so how, to retaliate. So far, the administration has stopped short of publicly accusing the Russian government of President Vladimir V. Putin of engineering the theft of research and emails from the Democratic National Committee and hacking into other campaign computer systems. However, private investigators have identified the suspects, and American intelligence agencies have told the White House that they have high confidence that the Russian government was responsible. Less certain is who is behind the selective leaks of the material, and whether they have a clear political objective. Suspecting such meddling is different from proving it with a certainty sufficient for any American president to order a response. Even if officials gather the proof, they may not be able to make their evidence public without tipping off Russia, or its proxies in cyberspace, about how deeply the National Security Agency has penetrated that countrys networks. And designing a response that will send a clear message, without prompting escalation or undermining efforts to work with Russia in places like Syria, where Russia is simultaneously an adversary and a partner, is even harder. The Russians tried to make it tougher still on Saturday when they declared that they had found evidence of American activity in their government systems. It was hardly a shocking revelation anyone who leafed through Edward J. Snowdens revelations saw evidence of daily efforts to break into Russian spy agencies, nuclear installations and leadership compounds. But in a talk on Friday evening at the Aspen Security Forum, an annual gathering that draws many of the nations top intelligence and military officials, John O. Brennan, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, made clear that while spying on each others political institutions is fair game, making data public     in true or altered form     to influence an election is a new level of malicious activity, far different from ordinary spy vs. spy maneuvers. When it is determined who is responsible for this, Mr. Brennan said, choosing his words carefully to avoid any direct implication of Russia, there will be discussions at the highest levels of government about what the right course of action will be. Obviously interference in the U. S. election process is a very, very serious matter.  The Russia problem is thorny, and persistent. Just four months into his presidency in 2009, President Obama and his top national security advisers received a warning from American intelligence agencies: Of all the nations targeting Americas computer networks, a National Intelligence Estimate warned, Russia had the most robust, longstanding program that combines a patient, multidisciplinary approach to computer network operations with proven access and tradecraft.  Mr. Obama might have been a bit distracted at the time. While setting up his new administration, he was also learning the dark arts of cyberwar, descending into the Situation Room to oversee a complex   offensive operation to disable Irans nuclear centrifuges. He expressed concern to his aides that the operation would help fuel the escalation of cyberattacks and counterattacks. The concern was justified. Since then, Iran has attacked Saudi Arabia, Russia has brought down a power grid in Ukraine, the North Koreans have attacked the South. The list gets longer every month. But deterrence has been spotty. In the Democratic National Committee case, two senior administration officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the options, ranging from countercyberattacks on the F. S. B. and the G. R. U. two competing Russian spy agencies at the center of the current hacking, to economic, travel and other sanctions aimed at suspected perpetrators. At the event in Aspen on Saturday afternoon, Lisa O. Monaco, Mr. Obamas homeland security adviser, sidestepped specific discussion of the D. N. C. hacking but acknowledged that the administration might soon have to consider whether the United States electoral system constitutes critical infrastructure, like the power grid or the cellphone network. I think its a serious question, she said, especially if there is coercion, destruction, manipulation of data.  Ms. Monaco noted that whenever the United States thinks about retaliation, the danger of escalation and misinterpretation is such that we have to be responsible about it.  But she also said that if an event were serious enough, we have to be very clear we will respond.  The cost of doing nothing could be high. As the United States and other nations move to more electronic voting systems, the opportunities for mischief rise. Imagine, for example, a vote as close as the 2000 presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore, but with accusations about    foreign manipulation of the ballots or the vote count, leaving Americans wondering about the validity of the outcome. For Mr. Obama, the president who has done the most to raise alarms about the risks of cyberattacks and the most to build up the United States Cyber Command, this territory is fraught with politics, intelligence   and questions of American values. I think that the administration needs to be ironclad on the evidence here to convince the American people that this is about policy, not politics, said Jason Healey, a scholar at Columbia University who specializes in cyberconflict between nations. This has got to be about defending a constitutional process, not a party.  Last week, two California Democrats who specialize in intelligence issues, Representative Adam B. Schiff and Senator Dianne Feinstein, sent Mr. Obama a letter urging him to make public the intelligence assessments on the Democratic National Committee hacking. Mr. Obama often says the world of cyberconflict is still the Wild West.  There are no treaties, no international laws, just a patchwork set of emerging norms of what constitutes acceptable behavior. For example, Mr. Obama has pressed President Xi Jinping of China to work with the United States and other nations to develop rules about the theft of intellectual property, and about not interfering with a nations efforts to bring attacked systems back online. Attacking another nations power grid in peacetime is considered out of bounds. But every new case brings a new and imaginative way to weaponize cyberpower. Until November 2014, when North Korea hacked into the computers at Sony Pictures Entertainment in retaliation for a comedy that portrayed a C. I. A. plot to assassinate Kim   the countrys leader, no one seriously considered a movie studio to be critical infrastructure.  Yet the attack on Sony     which melted down 70 percent of its computing power     was the only case that brought the president to the White House press room to accuse another nation of launching a deliberate cyberattack, and to promise retaliation. Mr. Obama said he was driven to go public by the fact that North Korea was trying to suppress free speech and intimidate Americans with threats if they went to the theater. It is unclear how the United States may have retaliated against the North in secret, if it even did so. But the public punishment, the announcement of some mild economic sanctions, seemed highly ineffective. They were lost in the sea of other sanctions imposed on the North since the signing of the armistice that halted, but did not end, the Korean War 63 years ago. Yet the decision to name North Korea     a country with which the United States does no other real business     was an outlier. China was never formally named in the theft of the security clearance files on more than 21 million Americans, revealing fingerprints, personal financial details and the personal data about family, friends and former lovers. To James R. Clapper Jr. the director of national intelligence, that was not an attack, it was just very good espionage. Given the chance, he said last year, we would have done the same thing.  Similarly, the administration decided not to call out Russia when the same intelligence agencies implicated in the D. N. C. attack were believed to be behind the siphoning of tens of thousands of unclassified emails from the systems of the State Department and the White House. There was also a more targeted cyberespionage operation, which investigators attributed to the same actors, aimed at the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But again, it was considered within the bounds of spy vs. spy. Speaking at the Aspen forum on Thursday, Mr. Clapper, while stepping around who had conducted the hacking, said that in Mr. Putins mind, the United States had meddled in Russian politics, in Ukraine and Georgia     all part of former Soviet territory. (Mr. Putin complained that Hillary Clinton, in 2011, helped spark protests over a Russian parliamentary election that the United States considered riddled with voter fraud.) Of course they see a U. S. conspiracy behind every bush and ascribe far more impact than were actually guilty of, but thats their  Mr. Clapper said. And so I think their approach is they believe we are trying to influence political developments in Russia, trying to effect change, and so their natural response is to retaliate and do unto us as they think weve done unto them.  He later described Mr. Putin as paranoid and said he is less of a throwback to the Communist era, than to the czars.  He added later: He wants to be seen as the leader of a great power, coequal with the United States."
Aussie Muslims Demand Safe Spaces so Followers Can Vent Extremist Views,Breitbart,Simon Kent,6/8/2017,"An Australian Islamic group wants   safe spaces provided for young Muslims to discuss inflammatory issues away from broader public scrutiny. [In a submission to an Australian parliamentary inquiry into freedom of religion, the Islamic Council of Victoria (ICV) said such   forums enabled opinions to be respectfully and intelligently debated and challenged while also helping to combat alleged mental health problems in the young Muslim community in the State of Victoria.  The ICV claimed Muslim Victorians experience religious intolerance in the form of Islamophobia, racial abuse and breaches of our universal human rights.  The alleged inability of Muslim adherents to safely practice their religion without feeling subject to surveillance is a human rights issue, according to the ICV. The call comes just days after    Somali refugee Yacub Khayre took a hostage, killed a man, and wounded three police officers in Melbourne. The terrorist explicitly dedicated the attack to the Islamic State and   while Islamic State swiftly claimed him as a soldier of the caliphate. ICV spokesman Adel Salman said they did not consider the safe space proposal controversial, because it is a practice he claimed     without providing evidence     is already used with young people in other countries. This is about good practice because the youth require an avenue to express their views in a safe environment       where they feel their views are valued, where they can be respectfully challenged and counter views presented, Mr. Salman said. He said such spaces would be conducted with experts who are familiar with the methodology, and understand the way the conversation can be guided. Victoria State Premier Daniel  Andrews ruled out any possibility of funding such an initiative. I am very troubled by the suggestion that we might have a space where people could be radical as part of a   programme. That makes no sense to me whatsoever."
Amazons July 12 Day of Action for Net Neutrality is Big Communist Anniversary - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/8/2017,"Amazon is mobilizing a July 12 collective Day of Action for tech corporations and social justice warriors to unite in rebelling against the FCCs efforts to overturn Net Neutrality. The 12th falls on the 96th anniversary of Lenins call to deploy Russian communists to start civil wars around the world. [In a workers of the world unite for corporate interests, Amazons CEO Jeff Bezos has mobilized big tech corporate support from Mozilla, Reddit, Kickstarter, Etsy and Vimeo to fill the streets with   allies from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) Electronic Frontier Foundation, and Greenpeace.  The Day of Action seeks to upend the May 18 vote by FCC Republican Commissioners Ajit Pai and Michael OReilly, over the opposition by Democrat Commissioner Mignon Clyburn, to overturn the Obama administrations 2015 adoption of Net Neutrality.  The Democrats regulatory regime gave the U. S. government the effective right to take control of the Internet, create new taxation authority, and regulate the fairness of political thought under rules that once applied to the old ATT telephone monopoly. Under federal administrative law, the   FCC rule change allows a   initial public comment until July 17, and then another 30 days for replies to those comments by Aug. 16. Advocates of Net Neutrality called it a democratizing principle. But opponents complained that under Net Neutrality, corporate interests like Amazon, Netflix and Googles YouTube could make huge profits by clogging cable delivery pipes with enormous amounts of data at no cost. The   publication The Nation classified the February 2015   FCC majoritys passage of Net Neutrality as people power. But it appeared to be more about the corporate power that funded a record $139. 5 million in lobbying expenses by computer and Internet companies to influence the biggest regulatory expansion in decades. Naming July 12th the Day of Action will conjure 96th anniversary of the release of Vladimir Lenins Report on the Tactics of the Revolutionary Communist Party. Soviets cadres had believed that once Russian workers overthrew capitalism, it would cause spontaneous uprisings by the workers of the world that would quickly sweep capitalism into the dustbin of history. But after four years and no more worldwide revolutions, Lenin used the July 12, 1921 conclusion of the Third Congress of The Communist International publish Tactics to encourage Russian communists to export civil war and openly revolutionary uprisings.  July 12, 1948 was also the day President Truman used the Democratic Party Platform to expand Marshall Plan to fight communism: Ours is the party under which were conceived the instruments for resisting Communist aggression and for rebuilding the economic strength of the democratic countries of Europe and Asia     the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan.    protests against Trump administration policies have been led by Antifa (antifascist) groups who wear black clothing and   as well as scarves, sunglasses, ski masks and motorcycle helmets. Antifa forces shut down Berkeley in April and May by using fists,   pepper spray and heavy bike locks to prevent presentations by conservative speakers. The Urban Dictionary describes Antifa as:   champagne    white boys who dont like nationalists or fascists. They consider themselves to be rebelling against the establishment, whilst upholding all of its   correct views.  By uniting corporate and social justice forces for a July 12 Day of Action, just days before the end of the FCC comment period to oppose dumping Net Neutrality, Silicon Valley could fill the streets of Americas biggest cities with large and potentially violent protests."
"Washington, DC Bar-Goers Express Disappointment over James Comey Hearing - Breitbart",Breitbart,Kristina Wong &amp Alex Clark,6/8/2017,"Although around 500 people excitedly gathered at Union Pub Tuesday morning in Washington, D. C. in anticipation of the live airing of a Senate hearing featuring former FBI Director James Comey, many left disappointed. [At least 50 people were in line before the bar opened at 9:30 a. m. for the 10:00 a. m. Senate intelligence hearing, including unemployed former government officials. A woman standing in line at Union Pub said she looked forward to hearing Comey tell the truth.   But after roughly     hours, people shuffled out, calling it underwhelming.  Its what I expected, its underwhelming, nothing explosive has been revealed so far. James Comey is pragmatic, hes a Washingtonian who still has a lot of his future career ahead of him. He does not want to create unnecessary conflict, said one man, who wished not to be named. The investigation is not a public matter. It is a legal, technical, and professional matter. But people here in DC are turning it into the Super Bowl, said another man, who also did not want to be named. An office manager at a university named Derek said he was happy that Comey called the President a liar but said he wanted some evidence. I want there to be tapes, he said. Another man who wished to remain anonymous said he was hoping to hear more damning testimony, more smoking guns, but that Comey phrased things carefully to be accurate.  One man with a computer wallpaper that said Impeach Trump refused to talk to Breitbart. Several people said they hoped more would come out of a closed hearing later in the day, where Comey can discuss classified information. What we got out of this hearing was an affirmation of what we already knew. Any juicy bombshells will come out of the closed door meetings, he said. A man named Ben, who is currently unemployed but used to work at the State Department, said that the best hope for Trump getting impeached would be the Democrats winning the House, since he doesnt see Republicans going along with it. But one man, Christopher, who worked at Trader Joes, said he was happy with Comeys performance, despite him not opining on whether there was any obstruction of justice. Comey was in control, got his message out. He knows its not to say whether its obstruction. He did what he set out to do, he said. Another said he came just to enjoy Comeys testimony.  Hes a rock of integrity, Tom, a computer science major, said. Hes willingly testified against and for both sides.  Another man, Alex, who works in environmental relations for a utility, did not hide his anger. My take cant be quoted in a family friendly publication. It shows how   everything is     a bunch of senior Republicans abase themselves in a grotesque manner as they run flack for a man theyre covering for him and abasing themselves even though this is national security, he said. Paul, an Army veteran and Ph. D. student, said there was something for everyone here.  This is just confirmation bias both sides will find stuff that benefits them, he said. There was only one person, a government affairs intern named Alex, who identified himself as a Republican in the elite DC watering hole. He called the hearing same old, same old.  The only person who effectively pressed Comey was Marco Rubio. Im not a Trump fanatic, but if he does well, its good for the country. We have an issue in this country of unprecedented division, he said."
Red Cross Therapist Stabbed to Death by Syrian Asylum Seeker,Breitbart,Chris Tomlinson,6/8/2017,"A Red Cross therapist who helped treat asylum seekers was stabbed to death by a    Syrian after the pair got into a heated argument. [The fatal stabbing occurred at a Red Cross facility in Saarbrcken that specialised in counselling and therapy for asylum seekers. The victim, a therapist employed by the Red Cross, was repeatedly stabbed by the Syrian and succumbed to his wounds at the scene, Die Welt reports.  Police say the attack occurred during a counselling session and say the asylum seeker got into a heated argument with the therapist. The Syrian then brought out a knife which he had on his person and used it to commit the deadly attack. Police have not said what caused the conflict but noted the Syrian had also been injured in the incident and had to be taken to the hospital. Consequently, police have no been able to interrogate him. They have not released the identity of the attacker or the victim in the case so far. German Red Cross President Rudolf Seiters briefly commented on the attack saying that he was shocked. The organisation said they are mourning the death of the therapist who they called a meritorious employee. The Red Cross has been criticised in Germany in the past when last year they were accused of covering up sexual abuse in one their asylum centres in Potsdam. The allegations were brought forward by a former employee who wrote a letter saying female staff were sexually harassed by male migrants and the manager of the asylum home chose to cover up the issue rather than address it. A similar murder of an asylum centre worker by a migrant occurred in Sweden last year when Alexandra Mezher was stabbed to death by a Somali asylum seeker. Ms. Mezher got involved in a dispute between migrants and as a result was attacked by the Somalian who claimed to be underage at the time but was later revealed to be an adult. Earlier this week, another asylum home murder occurred in Germany when an Afghan asylum seeker stabbed a    child to death. The    Afghan was already known to police and had a prior conviction for attempted murder by arson and was forced to wear an ankle monitor."
New Facebook Features Allow Politicians to Connect with Constituents - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/8/2017,"A new Facebook feature allows politicians to connect with constituents by showing which users in the comments are in their constituency.[  As part of the new update, Facebook has also released constituent insights and district targeting tools for politicians on the social network. Constituent badges are a new,   feature that allow Facebook users to identify themselves as a person living in the district the elected official represents, reports Tech Crunch. Facebook determines whether or not someone is a constituent based on the address information provided either in Town Hall, or as part of the process used to turn on the badges.  The idea with the badges is to make it easier for elected officials to determine which Facebook comments, questions and concerns are being shared by those they actually represent, they continued. Whether or not theyll treat these sentiments with the same degree of importance as they would a phone call, email, or letter remains to be seen.  Constituent insights will allow politicians to see whats popular in their constituency, including news stories, allowing them to discover whats relevant to Facebook users they represent. District targeting will allow politicians to gather feedback from accounts only in their constituency. The tools will give them the option of setting polls only to their local area and the ability to address local issues in posts that are only visible to those in the area. The update is Facebooks latest for their Town Hall section, which aims to connect politicians and their voters online. [Town Hall] identifies your elected officials     even local ones     sends reminders to vote and goads you to pick up the phone, explained The Wall Street Journal in March. On the web, Town Hall is accessible via a blue icon on the right side of members News Feed. On phones, it lives with other Facebook tools under a button with three vertical bars.  One of Town Halls most useful capabilities is identifying your elected officials. To do that, you have to tell Facebook where you live, they continued. The more precise you are, the more representatives it will identify. Many Facebook members already share some location information, and an address you enter in Town Hall wont be displayed, shared or used to serve ads, says Facebook.  Todays threats are increasingly global, but the infrastructure to protect us is not       Humanitys current systems are insufficient to address these issues, announced Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. For the past decade, Facebook has focused on connecting friends and families       With that foundation, our next focus will be developing the social infrastructure for community     for supporting us, for keeping us safe, for informing us, for civic engagement, and for inclusion of all.

High School Senior Headed for the Army Not Allowed to Wear Army Sash at Graduation - Breitbart,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/8/2017,"A California high school senior headed for the Army is not allowed to wear an Army sash with his robe and mortarboard at his graduation Friday. [Elias Velazquez made a decision to enlist in the U. S. Army after he graduated from Redlands High School, but his schools policy states that students cannot decorate their graduation gowns or caps except for California Scholarship Federation chords and sashes, KTTV reported.  It means something really honorable to me, its a whole new life transition to me, Elias said. Elias and his father are hoping the policy can be changed. Its kind of defeating the purpose of achieving that greatness, Joe said. We push our kids to strive and try to be better and do the best they can and then we tell them at their grad ceremony, We need you all to be the same because we dont want to hurt anyone elses feelings.  His father, Joe, posted about the situation on social media to open community dialogue about the situation. Were simply trying to open some community dialogue and get people to understand some rules are okay to change, Joe said. The Redlands School District said the reason for the rules is to promote fairness and has nothing to do with not supporting the military. We are totally supportive of our men and women in the military. This has nothing to do with a lack of our support, a spokesperson for the district said. Although Elias says he is not happy about not being able to wear the sash, he is committed to following every order they give him since he is not one to stray from the rules. The school said that students can wear sashes during other graduation events and before and after the ceremony. A high school senior in Indiana was also told not to wear her Army sash at graduation May 25 because the school district wanted to focus on high school accomplishments at the graduation ceremony. In 2016, a Maine high school senior was told by his schools superintendent that he could not display his Army sash at graduation, but could display it at the schools senior awards ceremony."
"Saying Shell Do Everything, Aussie Girl Sells Her Virginity for $250K",Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/8/2017,"A    Australian woman stirred controversy recently when she took out a classified ad to sell her virginity for $250, 000, reports say. [In her ad, the young woman described herself as having an athletic body. She says she stands at 5 feet, three inches and weighs 97 pounds. The woman posted to a classified ad website called Locanto this week, the Daily Mail reported.  Photos associated with the ad show a slender girl with long, dirty blond hair standing in her underwear. She began her ad telling potential clients that she had several conditions for the sale of her virginity. We have to go to a restaurant, so we can go out for a dinner, and we can meet, the ad said. It will happen in a hotel which you can choose. If I dont want to do this, I can rescind from the deal.  She also put a ban on any sort of sex toys and insisted there could be no violence involved. The price is $250. . Send me your questions and offer. I am open for everything, the ad concluded. This is far from the first time a young woman has offered her virginity for sale online. As the paper notes, an    German girl did the same thing in May. In March, a Romanian girl reportedly sold her virginity for $2. 6 million, despite the warning from her parents that they would disown her if she went through with the deal. In 2014, a    medical student said she would sell her virginity for $800, 000. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
Wyden: Trump interference with Comey almost Watergate-level,CNN,Saba Hamedy,6/8/2017,"(CNN) Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, said President Donald Trumps alleged attempt to interfere in ousted FBI Director James Comeys Russia investigation is almost  . Comey on Wednesday released an opening statement ahead of his appearance before the Senate intelligence committee. In it, the former FBI official, who was leading the investigation into Russias meddling into the 2016 election, wrote that Trump asked him to pledge his loyalty. Comey also said the President asked him to stop investigating   security adviser Michael Flynn, and to publicly declare that Trump was not under investigation. It is a remarkable statement, Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, told CNNs Jake Tapper on The Lead on Wednesday. It reads more like a Tom Clancy novel than your usual   congressional testimony. For example, Comey confirms that Trump asked him to end that investigation into Flynn. That by itself is almost a   effort to interfere with an ongoing investigation. When asked if he thought Trump potentially obstructed justice, Wyden said, Ill tell you, if it looks like a duck, and it quacks like a duck, it just might be a duck. He went on to criticize Trumps interactions with Comey. Comey confirmed that the President did ask for a pledge of loyalty, Wyden said. Thats not what our great institutions are all about. Its not about the individual, its about the rule of law. That goes all the way back to the very basis of our country. This is not the first time an official has made comparisons between Watergate and the ongoing probe into Russias meddling in the 2016 election. James Clapper, the former director of national intelligence, said Wednesday that Watergate pales in comparison to the controversy surrounding the Trump administration and Russia. During a GOP dinner in May, Sen. John McCain said the Trump scandals have reached Watergate size and scale."
RNC chair reflects on whether women can have it all,CNN,Ashley Killough,6/8/2017,"(CNN) Ronna Romney McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, grew emotional Wednesday night while reflecting on the challenges women face raising a family and taking on leadership roles. In a discussion on   balance at an event highlighting the CNN series Badass Women of Washington, the mother of two teared up as she talked about missing baseball games and doctors appointments. I dont know if you can have it all, she said, sitting on a panel featuring other   women in politics and moderated by CNNs Dana Bash.  I dont want to cry. Its hard to have it all, she continued, wiping away tears. But we have to do it because its women like us who have young kids who dont step up. If we dont take these leadership roles, our voices wont be heard. Romney McDaniel was chair of the Republican Party in Michigan and helped deliver a key victory for Trumps campaign when he won the Wolverine State in November. She was tapped to succeed Reince Priebus as RNC chair, becoming the first woman to get the position in decades. Politics runs in her blood    both her mother and grandmother ran for the Senate, not to mention her uncle, Republican Mitt Romney, who ran for president in 2012. The job requires long days with constant travel. While Romney McDaniel now works in Washington, her kids are still at home in Michigan. Its important for me as a mom to be here and show other women that moms can do this, she said. Laughing off her tears, Romney McDaniel quipped, Thats my first time crying in DC."
Texting suicide trial reveals legal shades of gray,CNN,Danny Cevallos,6/8/2017,"(CNN) Michelle Carter, 20, is on trial on a charge of involuntary manslaughter in connection with the death of her  boyfriend Conrad Roy III, who committed suicide after Carter sent numerous text messages encouraging him to kill himself. In this case, the digital records of Carters statements alone establish her intent to cause Conrads death and her awareness of her culpability afterward.   Her conduct was cruel. It was immoral.   It wasnt a crime. Suicide is an independent choice. Its what the law calls an intervening cause    something that breaks the causal connection between one persons action and the harm that may result from that action.   Still, Carter could be convicted, because involuntary manslaughter crimes are often nebulously defined, especially in Massachusetts.   There is no statutory definition of involuntary manslaughter in Massachusetts court cases have largely defined the contours of the crime. So not only can Carter be convicted under the law, theres a good chance she will be.   But she shouldnt.   This may be a minority opinion, but imposing liability for anothers suicide is a slippery slope. No one will shed a tear for defendants like Michelle Carter    or William   who was convicted of assisting suicide in Minnesota, despite doing nothing more than communicating words of encouragement over an electronic medium.   They are not sympathetic figures. They are pathetic figures. Its not about them. Its about opening a Pandoras box of criminal liability.  If you get in an argument over a taxi cab with some guy in the street and tell him to drop dead or the even better go kill yourself, could you be liable for his suicide? He might be having a bad week, and your comment was the thing that pushed him over the edge. If you think thats a bad analogy, look at the cases of bullied teens who take their own lives. Its easy to look to blame the bullies, but ultimately, the person who caused the death is the one who committed suicide.   Under common law, involuntary manslaughter generally requires that (1) the defendant intended to commit an act, (2) the intended act was wanton or reckless, and (3) the act caused the victims death.  Carter appears to have incessantly cajoled Roy until he was persuaded to kill himself. Her texts evince more than a negligent or reckless mind the intent behind them was clear: she wanted him to die. But did she legally cause Roys death? Roys act of killing himself was the primary act causing his own death legally, it intervened upon Carters lesser conduct.  As long as that intervening conduct is reasonably foreseeable, the defendant can still be held criminally responsible. If Carters actions still contributed to the death, then she is still liable. The victims conduct will only cut off her liability if its the sole cause of death    and thats the issue the court has to resolve. Cases in which a defendant only verbally encouraged suicide are relatively rare. The Massachusetts Supreme Court addressed a somewhat similar situation in 1961, when Ilario Persampieri was charged with involuntary manslaughter after his wife shot and killed herself. Unlike Carters case, Persamipieri loaded a rifle at his wifes request, gave her instructions to help her use it on herself, and dared her to do shoot herself, calling her a chicken. The defendant was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and challenged his conviction on appeal.   The appellate court affirmed Persampieris conviction for involuntary manslaughter because he was physically present, actively assisted and berated his wife into shooting herself. Other than the physical presence, and loading the gun, the case is not too different from Carters. Is physical presence even necessary in a text messaging, social media age? Probably not    and that will be a major issue for the Massachusetts court to address in this case. But sometimes the law is about   and this case should be one of those lines.  As much you may want to see Michelle Carter punished, we cant start holding people liable for just encouraging suicide by text message, from miles away. Holding her liable would continue a disturbing recent trend in the law looking to blame third parties in cases of suicide. In every suicide, there is ultimately only one actor causing death."
Trump looks like a man with something to hide,CNN,Errol Louis,6/8/2017,"(CNN) Be careful what you wish for.   Former FBI Director James Comeys prepared statement to Congress makes clear that when it comes to the   investigation of alleged Russian involvement in the 2016 election, President Trump is his own worst enemy. Against the advice of allies and adversaries alike, Trump has repeatedly, almost obsessively, attempted to shut down   inquiries. The effort, predictably, has backfired.  Instead of tamping down the issue, Trump has revved up public interest. Instead of asserting control of the FBI and other intelligence agencies, he now faces a probe led by a formidable independent counsel, Robert Mueller, the   serving director in FBI history. And instead of Comeys statement clearing President Trump in the eyes of the public, he now looks like a man with something to hide. Comeys words suggest that Trump, in     with his   chief, asked for things he had no business demanding. He wanted unspecified loyalty from an FBI director whose   term is specifically intended to insulate the bureau from political interference.  And most damaging of all, Trump asked for leniency for Michael Flynn, the fired national security adviser who allegedly lied about his contacts with a top Russian diplomat. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December . .. it was very concerning, given the FBIs role as an independent investigative agency, Comeys statement says.  The   intervention will come back to haunt Trump. Obstruction aside, its NEVER ok for a POTUS privately to ask an FBI Director to drop a criminal investigation. Extraordinary, wrong  dumb, tweeted Preet Bharara, the former U. S. attorney based in Manhattan who Trump unceremoniously fired back in March.  Bhararas is a   opinion. A majority of Americans think the President is interfering with investigations, and 61% think he fired Comey to protect himself, not for the good of the country, according to a new Washington   News poll.  Every new tweet,   interview and attack on the media has dug a deeper hole for Trump. Plans to create a   war room to reject   stories turned out to be a bust, reportedly because experienced lawyers declined to  staff it for the White House. That leaves an isolated President    a man with a penchant for lying    with the hopeless task of asking the public to believe him and not Comey. If hes wise, Trump will simply hunker down and try to stoically endure the storm of bad news coming his way, thanks to Comey. Trying to intervene, it should now be obvious, makes the President look like a man bent on a   not clarity."

British Soccer Fan Stabbed Eight Times While Fighting Three Knife-Wielding Terrorists,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,6/7/2017,"When hearing of an establishment called the Black and Blue Steakhouse, one could reasonably surmise that some, or at the very least one, extremely tough person could be found somewhere in there. Well, the three terrorists who attacked London Bridge over the weekend found the Black and Blue Steakhouse, and they found the toughest man in the house. [Or, maybe more to the point, he found them.  Roy Larner, 47, is a huge fan of the South East London soccer team Millwall F. C. The team is known as the Lions, and when   terrorists entered the Black and Blue to kill innocent people, Larner let them know who is the true king of the jungle. After the terrorists entered, with obvious bad intentions, Larner sprang into action: Like an idiot I shouted back at them. I thought, I need to take the p*** out of these b*****s. I took a few steps towards them and said, F*** you, Im Millwall. So they started attacking me. I stood in front of them trying to fight them off. Everyone else ran to the back. I was on my own against all three of them, thats why I got hurt so much. It was just me, trying to grab them with my bare hands and hold on. I was swinging. I got stabbed and sliced eight times. They got me in my head, chest and both hands. There was blood everywhere. They were saying, Islam, Islam! I said again, F*** you, Im Millwall! It was the worst thing I could have done as they carried on attacking me. Luckily, none of the blows were straight at me or Id be dead.  A petition has begun, with the aim of awarding Larner with the George Cross for bravery. The award is the second highest commendation granted by Great Britain. Looking at his scars, its really hard to imagine that he wont get it. If Millwall is looking for a new slogan, they may have found it. F*** you, Im Millwall! has a nice ring to it.

Ben Sasse Thinks Biden Would Have Won - The New York Times,New York Times,Ana Marie Cox,6/7/2017,"Were 11 weeks into the Trump administration. Whats the Senate like these days? I think that the institution     and I do mean all 535 people, but particularly the hundred in the Senate     is filled with really nice and   people. Ive been there 27 months. But whos counting? My average duration in a job is more like six months, because Ive done crisis and turnaround stuff for two decades. Ive been in a lot of companies and    and institutions that were really on fire in a lot of ways, the Senate is the least urgent, least serious institution Ive ever worked in. Theres this constant fighting. You should agree on what youre arguing about before you argue: We are either going to work at our house tonight or were going to make dinner together and play music in the living room or were going to go out to eat and go to a movie. But the problem is that, at this particular juncture, theres also a question of whether this hypothetical movie theater even exists. Why are you playing to this outdated, modernist idea that there are objective facts? [Laughs.] What is wrong with you? We do have to agree on some basic facts, despite this general reluctance to grant them legitimacy. Yeah, its a huge problem. I sit in the late Daniel Patrick Moynihans seat on the Senate floor. Hes the author of the saying, Everyones entitled to their own opinion, but youre not entitled to your own facts. Look at trade and automation: two competing but slightly overlapping forces in the shrinking of the duration of jobs right now. We have to be able to talk honestly about how disrupted this world is going to be, and it is crazy to mislead people and say were going to bring back all of the big factory jobs by creating a protectionist regime. That isnt true. Do you think that infighting creates a situation in which everyday Americans write off all politicians as cheaters and liars? It might explain how Donald Trump won, because it didnt make any difference to anybody that he seemed immoral     they thought of him as no worse than every other politician. I would argue pretty vociferously that its also because of who his opponent was. If Joe Biden would have run against Donald Trump, Biden would have won in a landslide. You have been a constant critic of Trump, even during the primaries. I campaigned with pretty much anybody not named Trump or Huckabee. Including Ted Cruz. Your book, which argues that Americas youths are largely coddled and ill equipped to compete in the global economy, is full of references to ancient history and philosophy. Are you trying to unseat Cruz as the intellectual of the Senate? I dont see what Im trying to do as trying to be the intellectual in the Senate. What is it that youre trying to do? Im the third or fourth most conservative guy by voting record in the institution, and yet most of the stuff I care about is not really partisan. We have had no foreign policy for the past 28 years for dealing with a   War world. And now you layer on nonstate actors, like jihadis, who have a presence in a quarter to a third of all the countries in the world, and the governments in those countries arent the main source of power anymore. But that isnt anywhere near what keeps the spies and generals up at night, about how cyberattacks will transform war and create all these gray areas that arent quite war but are warlike. I cannot, for the life of me, imagine what the obvious    answer looks like, with the divide between the two parties in trying to figure out a   strategy in this new age."
"Ramadan Rage 2017: 1,424 Fatalities Already More than Triple Those Last Year - Breitbart",Breitbart,Edwin Mora,6/7/2017,"Welcome to Breitbart Newss running count of worldwide jihadist terrorist attacks during Ramadan 2017. Check back for updates through the end of the Islamic holy month on June 24. [With only days left in this years holiest month for Muslims, the fatalities at 1, 434 have more than tripled the estimated 421 that took place during the entire Ramadan period last year, considered one of the bloodiest in recent memory.  The 2, 794 total number of casualties (1, 434 murders and 1, 360 injuries) have more than doubled the estimated 1, 150 (421 deaths and 729 injuries that took place in 2016. There have been nearly 140 incidents in more than 20 mainly Muslim nations during Ramadan this year, which began on May 27 and expected to end on June 24. In an audio message released last week purporting to originate from the Islamic State ( ) the jihadist group again urges its followers and sympathizers to launch terrorist attacks in the United States, Europe, Russia, Australia, Iraq, Syria, Iran, and the Philippines during the ongoing Islamic holy month. ISIS has issued multiple messages urging violent attacks during Ramadan. Consistent with the years since the group surfaced in 2014, ISIS, including its Boko Haram affiliate, takes the grim title of the worlds most prolific terrorist group during Ramadan 2017. ISIS has been linked to more than 90 of the nearly 140 incidents (about 65 percent) so far, with about three days left of the holy month. The Taliban, as well as   and its offshoots, have also been involved in the killing and murder of mainly fellow Muslims. This deaths during this years Ramadan have exceeded those from the same period in 2016, considered the deadliest holy month in recent memory. During Ramadan, the majority of Muslims follow the tradition of abstaining from eating, drinking, smoking, having sex, and other physical needs each day, starting from before the break of dawn until sunset. However, extremists perceive Ramadan as a time when martyrdom and jihad are especially rewarded in paradise, prompting a spike in the terrorist attacks during the period every year. Islamic extremist groups encourage martyrdom among their sympathizers and followers, promoting the belief that they will be doubly rewarded if they fatally castigate infidels during Ramadan. In previous years, the fatalities have included women, children, and members of the Christian, minority. This year is no exception. Although Muslims of all sects make up the majority, there are members of a wide variety of ethnic and religious groups among the victims: Westerners, Christians, Asians, Sunnis, Shiites, and Arabs, among others. The West has not been immune to the Islamic extremists call to massacre during Ramadan. Breitbart News count, gleaned from the Religion of Peace website in coordination with news reports, excludes casualties directly linked to battles between U. S.  coalition and   and   troops loyal to dictator Bashar  . The total number of Ramadan deaths and injuries could be higher. All the terrorist attacks during Ramadan 2017, as documented by Breitbart News, include: May 27     Charchino, Afghanistan     Group fighting in favor of imposing Islamic law ambushes checkpoint, kills 11.

Paul Ryan: Not Appropriate for Trump to Ask for Comeys Loyalty - Breitbart,Breitbart,Pam Key,6/7/2017,"Wednesday on MSNBCs For the Record, while discussing the statement from former FBI Director James Comey ahead of his congressional testimony scheduled for Thursday, House Speaker Rep.

When asked if he believes it is appropriate for the president to ask for loyalty from the FBI director, Ryan said Yeah, No. Obviously, I dont think that is. I think Director Comey will probably get a lot of questions about that tomorrow.  He added, Yes, FBI directors are supposed to be independent. Thats something thats very, very critical.

A woman who could have been president if she had not hitched her wagon to that loser, Clinton. A woman who could have written her ticket and named her price. A woman who was the smartest and most accomplished. This was her brand this was her image. It was bought, it was paid for, it was fed, it was built up and now whats happening to her? She is delirious. She cannot live in reality. She cannot accept whats happening. She has been rejected. This is the    woman in America, including by her own party. If theres anybody the Democrats     and Im serious about this. If theres anybody the Democrats owe, it is that woman. Without her biting the bullet and a bunch of other things, the Bill Clinton administration would have not survived, and the Democrat Party would have been taken down the tank with him. Hillary Clinton   saved her husbands administration. I dont care if she did it for selfish reasons. I dont care if she did it for calculating reasons that would say that I have to do this to become president myself. She still did it. She ate the excrement sandwich that being married to that guy was, from the time he was governor of Arkansas, all the affairs, all the women, all the allegations, and she was the loyal trooper, blaming the   conspiracy, destroying the women accusers, maintaining his administration and the Democrat Party. And if anybody has ever been owed, its Hillary Clinton. And 2008 was supposed to be the big payoff, and they threw her under the bus for a young untested, unproven   guy with an exotic name. And she gave them another chance to love her. She gave them another chance to accept here. She went even so far as to work it with Debbie Blabbermouth Schultz to rig the primaries against Crazy Bernie so the Democrats could not throw her under the bus. And she still got beat by some guy they think has no business being in politics, doesnt know what hes doing, in their minds hates women, is abusive to women, doesnt like anybody. A guy who shouldnt have got 20% of the vote and beat her in an electoral near landslide, shes going crazy. In her mind, her party abandoned her, the Democrat National Committee abandoned her, even though they worked with her to rig the primary. Her money people abandoned her. Nobody helped her. Everybody left her and hung her out to dry. She couldnt trust anybody. Shes dumping on everybody that worked in her campaign except for Huma. And its all happening in public. She is blaming 19 different things and people for her loss, including     are you ready? A thousand Russian agents in Macedonia. Did you hear that one? Agents in Macedonia working to undermine her campaign. She blamed the Democrat National Committee. She blamed expectations. She blamed her polling units. She blamed the media. And in some of these cases, she is right. Shes out there saying, I had too many expectations that were built up around my victory.  Shes complaining about all of the people who just assumed that she was gonna win in a landslide, but she was one of them. You know, she wants to distance herself from these people, but she was involved in every one. Look, shes the one that practically fell on her face leaving Ground Zero on July 4th or whenever it was. Shes the one who couldnt stop coughing doing public speeches and blaming it on whatever else. She is the one wearing glasses here that are supposedly to prevent seizures. Shes the one that couldnt name one reason why she wanted to be elected, what she was gonna do. For a woman who is the smartest woman in the world, she couldnt even articulate liberalism! And thats one of the easiest things in the world to do, and she couldnt even figure out a way to do that and sell it. When you stop and think, if you put yourself in her shoes     no, lets not. When you imagine yourself in her position, psychologically, folks, she was supposed to be president twice and actually maybe three times. She was supposed to be   with her husband. And, as such, they gave her health care in 1993. Smartest woman in the world was gonna make sure we got national health care, and she was gonna get the credit for it, not her lug head, cheating husband. And she blew that. In her mind, you dont know how much she actually accepts and how much she lies to herself, but regardless what shes telling herself, the end result is loss, loss, loss, humiliating defeat, unbelievable. And its got to be hard psychologically, when you measure that against what she expected, what everybody promised her, what she assumed. You know in her private moments in two different campaigns, shes actually imagining being in the Oval Office with herself behind that desk. And let me tell you something else about Hillary Clinton. And you can see it, and you can listen to her speak. She is a true feminist from the modern era. She has a grudge about being a woman. Shes got a chip on her shoulder about it, as the ardent feminazis of the modern era, which I trace the beginnings, 1969, 1970. She is a product of all of these womens studies courses where she was raised and she was educated and she was sensitized to the idea that life as a woman was the pinnacle of unfairness, the pinnacle of discrimination, the pinnacle of being insulted as a human being, and she still carries all that around. And she still feels the need to prove herself as smarter and better than any other guy. And the evidence is shes not even smarter or better than Donald Trump, who they all collectively despise. I defy any of you to actually put yourself in her situation and not be psychologically ripped to shreds. Now, you think, But Rush, you gotta know, you cant win everything. Its tough and tumble. People say things. Shes run the war room.  Yeah. Yeah. But Im telling you, shes had a lifetime of hype as the best, as the smartest, as the most entitled. Shes living in this fantasy world now. She goes out and does these personal appearances and shes got, its not fans, shes got a cult. Theres a cult of   women that will show up wherever she goes, 15 or 20 of them, maybe 50, depending on the venue. And they treat her like she has been victimized, the biggest injustice in the history of humanity. Her defeat in 2016. So she is coming apart right in front of our eyes. Were witnessing it. We saw it during the campaign. Its just that many didnt have the confidence to say thats what it was because even we couldnt imagine her losing. How many times have I told you over the course of the years of this program how frustrated I have been to encounter people on our side who are scared to death of this woman? Do you remember me telling you that, how frustrated Id get? They would greet me and say, Theres a 75% chance Hillary Clintons gonna be president.  So what? Its over.  Hillary Clinton       There were people on our side that were mortally afraid of this woman for whatever number of reasons. They could not imagine that the Clinton machine would lose neither could she. Follow Jeff Poor on Twitter @jeff_poor"
"Ahead of Comey testimony, GOP preps response efforts",CNN,Jeremy Diamond,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump couldnt get through a round of thank yous during a meeting Tuesday with GOP leaders and his top White House aides without alluding to the   controversy that has now reached his    and top adviser Jared Kushner. Jareds actually become much more famous than me . .. Im a little upset about that, Trump said obliquely, referring to the   allegations surrounding his   s contacts with Russian officials. Nervous laughter rippled through the room of GOP bigwigs huddled around the Roosevelt Room table, though House Speaker Paul Ryan barely managed a smirk. The GOP leaders had huddled at the White House to chart a way forward on two   legislative items that have stalled in Congress, tax and health care reform. But the remark    from a President who in recent weeks has appeared at times consumed by the barrage of Russia allegations    was yet another painful reminder that the Republicans legislative agenda was about to be upended once again by the controversy that has stormed over the White House for months. Comey speaks, Axed FBI Director James Comey will break his silence on Thursday in sworn testimony before the Senate intelligence committee to address his firing and allegations that Trump asked him to kill the federal investigation into his former national security adviser, putting the Russia controversy that has hampered the GOP agenda front and center once again. White House officials and the Presidents allies on the outside have begun crafting a plan to counter the Thursday testimony, but those efforts so far appear jumbled. As Trump embarked on the   of his first foreign trip, senior White House officials began crafting plans to create a war   structure to get a grip on the incessant salvo of   blockbusters.  But just two days before Comeys testimony, that war room has yet to materialize and multiple sources said its creation is effectively on hold until Trump fleshes out his legal team to represent him on the matter with a DC counsel to work with New   attorney Marc Kasowitz. Theres no surrogate operation, no big picture narrative, one source said. Its worse than it even looks. But Trump is continuing to stew over the Russia allegations and the lack of a robust operation to defend him from the constant barrage, recently cutting into a largely positive phone conversation to begin griping about the latest allegations that prompted the FBI to examine Kushners contacts with Russian officials. RNC to the rescue? Looking for   the White House is handing off Comey testimony response efforts to the Republican National Committee, which has already begun coordinating a messaging campaign at the national, state and local levels to defend the White House from Comeys potentially damaging testimony.  The RNC has already booked White House surrogates on local and national TV and radio programs and begun placing   and on Thursday will spearhead rapid response efforts to response to Comeys testimony. The RNCs top priority is to support and defend the White House and this week is no different, RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney said. Talking points shared by the RNC will focus in part on pushing the message that both Republicans and Democrats had previously lost confidence in the   director, urging Trump surrogates to parrot Democrats criticism of Comey before his firing. The RNC is also stepping in at a time when the White House is increasingly looking to distance itself from the Russia investigation. Theyre relying on the RNC a lot to drive some of the messaging to sort of separate themselves from it too, said a Republican close to the White House. The White House is realizing that they dont want to be the only ones bearing the burden for responding to Russia and so theyre farming some of it out. But the temporary plug for the Comey testimony still leaves the messaging problems that have beleaguered the White House for months unsolved. Stalled agenda, The drip, drip, drip of allegations surrounding Trump campaign associates contacts with Russian officials have gotten in the way of White House officials efforts to implement Trumps agenda, dogging efforts on Capitol Hill and sending the presidents top aides into crisis response mode. Theres no doubt that keeping members focused on investigations detracts from our legislative agenda and detracts from what were trying to deliver to the American people, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short told reporters on Monday. But beyond devising a thorough and effective messaging strategy to deflect the steady stream of bombshell reports surrounding the federal investigation that have dogged the White House in recent months, the White House will still have to contend with a President who has frequently stepped on official messaging efforts in 140 characters or less. Days before Comeys testimony, nobody would rule out that the President could take to Twitter on Thursday to respond directly to Comeys testimony    with perhaps less savvy than   talking points. On Monday, the President kicked off what was designed to be infrastructure week with a series of newsworthy tweets about his travel ban    just the latest instance of Trump stepping on his communications shop. And Trump advisers and Republicans across Washington are already bracing for a Twitter salvo from the President on Thursday. If theres ever a day for him to get his hands tied behind his back, thats the day, a Republican close to the White House said. But thats not gonna happen."
AG Jeff Sessions offered to quit,CNN,Evan Perez,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and Attorney General Jeff Sessions have had a series of heated exchanges in the last several weeks after Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe, a source close to Sessions told CNN Tuesday.   A senior administration official said that at one point, Sessions expressed he would be willing to resign if Trump no longer wanted him there.  The frustration comes at a critical juncture for Trump. Former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify Thursday about his private discussions with Trump and the Russia investigation has lapped into the White House, with questions about the Presidents    and adviser, Jared Kushner.  Tuesday afternoon, White House press secretary Sean Spicer declined to say whether Trump has confidence in Sessions. I have not had a discussion with him about that, Spicer said.  As of 9 p. m. ET Tuesday, the White House still was unable to say whether or not the President backs his attorney general, a White House official said. The official said they wanted to avoid a repeat of what happened when Kellyanne Conway said Trump had confidence in Flynn only to find out hours later that the national security adviser had been pushed out. Sessions remains at the Justice Department, where a spokeswoman told CNN that he is not stepping down. ABC News first reported Tuesday that Sessions offered to resign.  Brewing since Sessions recusal  Sessions recused himself from the Russia probe in March, shorty after The Washington Post reported on undisclosed meetings between him and the Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.  In the three months since Sessions stepped aside, the intensity of the probe has grown exponentially    culminating in Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosensteins decision to appoint Robert Mueller as special counsel.  The frustration between Trump and Sessions has gone both ways, with Justice Department officials upset that the Presidents tweets and comments caused problems for Sessions and Rosenstein in the wake of the Comey firing.  CNN has previously reported that Trump was frustrated with Sessions decision to recuse himself. Sessions was Trumps first supporter in the Senate and was an enthusiastic backer throughout the campaign    standing with Trump through multiple controversies. And Sessions own team has become a part of Trumps inner circle: former Sessions chief of staff Rick Dearborn is now Trumps deputy chief of staff, and former Sessions spokesman Stephen Miller has evolved into a highly influential figure as Trumps policy director and speechwriter.  After the election, Sessions was rewarded with one of the most prominent positions in Trumps new administration, atop the Justice Department.  But pressure has been mounting on Trump over his campaigns communications with Russians. Trump told NBC News that he fired Comey in part because of the Russia probe and Comey, in a memo about a private talk, said Trump pressured him to drop his investigation of former national security adviser Michael Flynn."
"In Montreal speech, Obama warns about appeal of authoritarianism",CNN,Eli Watkins,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) Former President Barack Obama warned Tuesday against the appeal of authoritarian voices around the world    at several points airing veiled criticism of his successor, President Donald Trump. In a rare   speech, delivered before the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, Obama called on people, in the face of uncertainty, to stand by some of the very   War II economic and political institutions Trump has repeatedly called into question. In periods like this, people looking for control and certainty    its inevitable, Obama told the Canadian audience. But it is important to remember that the world has gone through similar moments. . .. Our history also shows there is a better way. He said people should overcome fear and not listen to those who call for isolation or nationalism and those who suggest rolling back the rights of others. Obamas comments set a different tone than Trump, who campaigned on an America First message and has called Americanism his credo. Were also bound by the institutions that we built to keep the peace, Obama said, referring to the UN, NATO and NAFTA. Obama said that everyday people who felt left behind by government and a changing world could find authoritarians alluring. He said people who felt at a loss with the democratic process could try anything, but that liberal values would win out over time. I am convinced that the future does not belong to strongmen, Obama said. Without mentioning Trump, Obama spoke about the importance of wealthy nations investing in development abroad. Were going to have to summon the same capacity to adapt to new circumstances that we saw after World War II, Obama said. Were going to have to replace fear with hope. Thats the spirit that we need right now. Climate change, Obama repeatedly touched on the threat of climate change and Trumps decision last week to initiate the US withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement. Obviously, Im disappointed, Obama said. Still, he tried to make the case that the agreement could be effective, regardless of Trumps decision, calling the accords an agreement that even with the temporary absence of American leadership, will still give our children a fighting chance. He commended state and local leaders who have pledged to push for clean energy and combat climate change. They will keep pushing forward for the sake of future generations, Obama said.   life, Since leaving office, Obama and his wife Michelle spent a significant amount of time   and out of country. He emerged in April to speak at a form in Chicago. He has spoken several times since then. At the Montreal event, just as he made a case for the   War II international order and his own legacy, Obama argued for increased civic engagement and the spread of democratic values. He said   engagement and a lack of belief in the average persons ability to affect change in government weaken democratic institutions and are responsible for the advance of reactionary politicians. Obama pledged to work on increasing democratic participation for the rest of his   life. The focus for the rest of my time on this Earth    in addition to enjoying my children and, in a distant future, grandchildren    will be active citizenship in the United States and around the world, Obama said. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted Tuesday evening that he met with Obama in Montreal."
Top lines from James Comeys testimony,CNN,Tal Kopan,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) Former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify Thursday before the Senate on his interactions with President Donald Trump, and a copy of his testimony released Wednesday is full of   details.  Here is a collection of some of the most   lines in the fired FBI directors testimony, released by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.  1. He said he would do that and added, Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know. I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing.     Comey describing an April 11 phone call with Trump in which he told the President to contact the attorney general instead of the FBI director directly. 2. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia.    Comey describing a March 30 phone call in which Trump called the Russia investigation a cloud. 3. He asked what we could do to lift the cloud.     Comey describing the March 30 phone call.  4. A few moments later, the President said, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty. I didnt move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed.    Comey describing a January 27    dinner with the President.    5. I discussed with the FBIs leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure   Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true we did not have an open   case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. . .. I offered that assurance.    Comey on a January 6 meeting with Trump, explaining what he was told about any investigation into him personally.  6. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, I want to talk about Mike Flynn.     Comey describing a February 14 meeting in the Oval Office, during which Trump excused the other participants to speak to Comey alone."
Do Comeys revelations show obstruction of justice?,CNN,Laura Jarrett,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) Fired FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed for the first time Wednesday a series of very concerning, very awkward and inappropriate conversations with President Donald Trump that concerned him greatly    but do these interactions rise to the level of obstruction of justice? Some legal experts say this isnt a close call. What is obstruction of justice? Lets just keep this in perspective. There is a criminal investigation going on of one of the Presidents top associates, his former national security adviser, one of the most . .. important people in the government. He gets fired. Hes under criminal investigation and the President brings in the FBI director and says, please stop your investigation, said CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin on CNNs Newsroom. If that isnt obstruction of justice, I dont know what is. But others cautioned that proving the President acted with a specific intent to obstruct an official proceeding from a legal standpoint still poses significant challenges.  This moves the ball forward, but whether it moves the ball past the finish line will be up for debate, said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti, now a partner at Thompson Coburn. The key question here is whether the President acted with corrupt intent and, to determine what his intent was, we have to look at all the facts and circumstances surrounding the case. The facts and circumstances described in Comeys planned testimony are   and two details in particular struck some legal experts as particularly problematic. First, Trump repeatedly implored Comey to lift the cloud of the Russia investigation hanging over him. Second, Trump asked Attorney General Jeff Sessions and others to leave during a February 14 meeting so that the President could speak with Comey alone.  The fact that he asks Comey to be alone with him is problematic and indicates a state of mind, said Michael Zeldin, a former top official at the Justice Department. Why would you ask the AG to leave the room? It seems to imply some ulterior motive. He asks for something that is inappropriate to ask for. . .. This is getting closer and closer to an indictable case. William Yeomans, a   veteran of the Justice Department and fellow at American University Law School, agreed that Comeys new testimony doesnt help the President. I think Comeys testimony contributes circumstantially to what is already clear obstruction of justice, Yeomans explained. Here, the obstructor very unwisely announced his intent. His efforts to get Comey to back off of Flynn and his reported effort to get intelligence officials to intervene with the FBI provide further, unnecessary, support for his confession. But others say not so fast. It is understandable that Comey would see this as inappropriate. That does not make it criminal, said Andrew McCarthy, a former federal prosecutor who writes for the conservative National Review.  You can disagree with Trumps reasoning, but it is clearly not corrupt, which is the sine qua non of obstruction, McCarthy added. Plus, to repeat, he did not order Comey to end the investigation. Pressuring a subordinate is not obstruction. Trump allowed Comey to continue exercising his discretion, though he did express hope about how that exercise would turn out. GOP lobbyist David Urban echoed the same point on CNNs The Lead with Jake Tapper. Pressure doesnt equal obstruction. Comey was a tough guy who hearkens back to the Bush days, Urban said. He knows what pressure is and what it isnt. But Steve Vladeck, CNN legal analyst and professor of law at the University of Texas School of Law, suggested everyone is missing the point    apart from anything gleaned from Comeys new testimony, Trump fired him. I think the key is that the most significant step Trump appears to have taken is not his specific discussions with Comey, but his decision to fire Comey entirely because of his dissatisfaction with the shape and progress of the Russia investigation, Vladeck explained. On Flynn, it devolves into a fight over what Trump intended and what Comey understood him to intend. Contrast that with firing Comey, where theres nowhere near the same mess about why he did it."
Democrats pounce on Handel for livable wage remark,CNN,Miranda Green,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) Democrats are jumping on Georgia congressional candidate Karen Handel for saying shes against a livable wage during a debate in the Peach State Tuesday night.  When asked about her position on minimum wage, Handel, a Republican, responded: This is an example of a fundamental difference between a liberal and a conservative. I do not support a livable wage. She added that she instead wants an economy that is robust with low taxes and regulation. Despite her   Handels comments almost instantly went viral, and groups like the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee were quick to clip and widely share the moment.  Even after 15 years running for office, Karen Handel couldnt resist admitting shes against a livable wage, the DCCC said in an email blast Wednesday. The Democratic Partys official Twitter account labeled her position indefensible and Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez said the comments prove she has no business being in Congress. Sen. Tim Kaine, the Democrats 2016 vice presidential candidate, tweeted, I stand for better skills, better jobs, better wages! Progressive groups, including MoveOn. org and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, also highlighted the moment. Handel faced off against Democrat Jon Ossoff for the first time Tuesday night ahead of the June 20 Georgia special election. Ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in April. He received 48. 1% of the vote, shy of the 50% needed to win outright. Polling currently shows a very close contest between the two, with Ossoff leading in some surveys. This is despite a history of Republicans holding the congressional district for more than 40 years. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich at one point held the seat for 20 years."
Blockbuster Capitol Hill hearings that made the whole country stop,CNN,Jennifer Hansler,6/7/2017,"Washington (CNN) Anticipation is high ahead of James Comeys public testimony on Capitol Hill Thursday. The former FBI director is slated to speak before the Senate intelligence committee for the first time since his unexpected ouster on May 9 and the chaos that emerged in the aftermath.  Comey has already shown himself to speak with relative candor during committee hearings. While Thursdays session is sure to generate major headlines, its not the first time that congressional testimony has been at the forefront of national news.  Heres a look back at some blockbuster hearings of the past: The Titanic disaster hearings, A subcommittee of the Senate Commerce Committee began these hearings on April 19, 1912, to investigate the causes behind the British ocean liners disastrous sinking. According to the committees report, more than 80 witnesses, including surviving passengers and crew, testified about the weather conditions and ice warnings, the collision and damage to the ship and the treatment and evacuation of the passengers.  The hearings lasted more than six weeks. The committee found that the accident indicated the necessity of additional legislation to secure the safety of life at sea, according to the report.  The   hearings, In 1953, as the new head of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Sen. Joe McCarthy shifted its mission from investigating fraud to investigating Communism in the US. He called hundreds of witnesses to testify about potential Communist activity, according to Senate transcripts.  McCarthy launched an inquiry in April 1954 into alleged Communist infiltration of the US Army. The army countered that the Wisconsin senator had sought preferential treatment for a subcommittee consultant who had been drafted.  McCarthy stepped down as chairman and three months worth of hearings followed, becoming a spectacle that was televised live across the United States. During a session in June, McCarthy alleged that one of the attorneys representing the army was tied to Communism.  It was in this exchange that the Armys lawyer, Joseph Welch, uttered the immortal line: Have you no sense of decency? The Warren Commission hearings, President Lyndon B. Johnson established this commission a week following John F. Kennedys death in 1963. Chaired by Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren, the commission was tasked with investigating Kennedys assassination and the killing of his alleged assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald.  The commission heard testimony from 552 witnesses, including Oswalds mother, brother and widow, according to the final report.  The hearings lasted nearly a year. The commission concluded that Oswald assassinated Kennedy, Jack Ruby killed Oswald, and that neither was part of any conspiracy, domestic or foreign, to assassinate President Kennedy.  They were unable to determine a definitive motive for Oswalds actions.  The Watergate hearings, The Senate Watergate Committee was created in February 1973 following a unanimous Senate vote and was tasked with investigating the June 1972   at the Watergate Hotel, its connection to President Richard Nixons reelection campaign, and all other illegal, improper, or unethical conduct occurring during the Presidential campaign of 1972, including political espionage and campaign finance practices, according to records.  The committee was chaired by Democratic Sen. Sam Ervin of North Carolina. The hearings, which opened in May 1973, dominated headlines and were broadcast nationally in   coverage. The committee was granted the authority to subpoena for Nixons infamous tapes    an order with which he refused to comply. The Senates public hearings concluded in February 1974. In July 1974, the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment against Nixon, which were sent to the full House for a vote. In August 1974, Nixon resigned.  Oliver Norths testimony, A joint congressional committee was created in January 1987 to investigate the   affair. In July 1987, the committee questioned Lt. Col. Oliver North, a former adviser to national security adviser John Poindexter. North had been dismissed by President Ronald Reagan in November 1986 after his role in the sale of weaponry to the Contras in Nicaragua through intermediaries in Iran was made public.  North testified for almost a a week, with all of the hearings airing live on television. News reports from the time noted that they were highly substantive and highly dramatic.  I came here to tell you the truth, the good, the bad and the ugly, North said at the outset. I am here to tell it all    pleasant and unpleasant, and I am here to accept responsibility for that which I did. I will not accept responsibility for that which I did not do.  Anita Hills testimony, In 1991, President George H. W. Bush nominated Justice Clarence Thomas to fill the vacancy left by Justice Thurgood Marshalls retirement. During his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Thomas former assistant, Anita Hill, publicly accused the   of sexual harassment.  It is only after a great deal of agonizing consideration and sleepless nights that I am able to talk of these unpleasant matters to anyone but my close friends, she said.  In three days of televised testimony, Hill described in explicit detail the harassment she endured during her employment with Thomas in the early 1980s. She also said that he told her to keep quiet. He said, that if I ever told anyone of his behavior that it would ruin his career. This was not an apology, nor was it an explanation, Hill recounted. When I was asked by a representative of this committee to report my experience I felt that I had to tell the truth. I could not keep silent. Ken Starrs testimony, In January 1998, reports of President Bill Clintons affair with Monica Lewinsky became public. Clinton denied the allegations at the time, famously saying: I did not have sexual relations with that woman. However, in taped grand jury testimony in August of that year, Clinton admitted to inappropriate encounters with Lewinsky, but maintained that they did not constitute sexual relations. Independent counsel Ken Starr said that Clintons testimony contained three lies, and thus three instances of perjury. In November 1998, Starr testified before the House Judiciary Committee during impeachment hearings. His opening statement lasted more than two hours his testimony lasted 12 hours. In it, Starr alleged that Clinton repeatedly chose deception. Hillary Clintons Benghazi testimony, In late October 2015, Hillary Clinton testified before the House Benghazi Committee in a marathon hearing. Clinton was questioned on the details of the September 11, 2012, attack that left four Americans dead in Benghazi, Libya. She was also asked about her use of a private email server during the nearly   showdown.  I came here because I said I would. And Ive done everything I know to do, as have the people with whom I worked, to try to answer your questions. I cannot do any more than that, Clinton said."
Trump reverses course in Qatar call,CNN,Nicole Gaouette,6/7/2017,"Washington  (CNN) President Donald Trump changed course on Qatar Wednesday, a day after praising a move by other Gulf nations to sever diplomatic relations with Doha, which hosts a US military base crucial to the fight against ISIS. In a phone call with the Qatari Emir, Trump extended an olive branch, offering to help the parties resolve their differences by inviting them to a White House meeting if necessary. The outreach came as US officials told CNN they were observing increased Qatari military activity as the country placed its forces on the highest state of alert over fears of an military incursion.  Trumps new tone echoed that of his secretaries of Defense and State, who emphasized Tuesday the need for Gulf unity and the importance of the US partnership with Qatar, home to the Al Udeid Air Base, the main regional center for air missions against ISIS.   Trumps phone call Wednesday made for a stark contrast to a series of tweets he sent Tuesday, in which he appeared to throw his weight behind the effort by Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt, along with Yemen, the Maldives and Libya, to ostracize Qatar.  Referring to his May trip to the region, Trump tweeted that it was so good to see the Saudi Arabia visit with the King and 50 countries already paying off. They said they would take a hard line on funding extremism, and all reference was pointing to Qatar. Perhaps this will be the beginning of the end to the horror of terrorism! In a description of the Wednesday call, the White House said Trump emphasized the importance of all countries in the region working together to prevent the financing of terrorist organizations and stop the promotion of extremist ideology.   Referring to the regional group that includes Qatar, the President also reiterated that a united Gulf Cooperation Council and a strong United   Cooperation Council partnership are critical to defeating terrorism and promoting regional stability. Trump spoke to the Saudi king Tuesday, the White House said, delivering a very similar message.  Trumps belated effort to calm the situation comes as the Qatari military has brought up 16 Leopard tanks out of storage in Doha and put the military on its highest alert out of fear that Saudi Arabia and others might attempt a military incursion. On June 5, the Qatari Ministry of Defense transmitted a message to the governments of the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain, saying they would fire on any naval ships from those countries that enter into its waters, a US official said. That official and others say the situation in Qatar has not affected US military operations and security in the country.  The three Sunni Gulf countries    Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and the UAE    along with Egypt accuse Qatar of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the region because of its ties to their Shiite rival, Iran, and its support for groups like the Muslim Brotherhood and Hamas.  Qatar acknowledges its links to these groups, but denies that it supports terrorism. The crisis was reportedly sparked by an interview with the Qatari leader that Qatar said was a false news story. CNN is reporting that US investigators believe Russian hackers may have been behind the effort and the FBI has been sent to Qatar to help investigate. They have ordered Qatari citizens and diplomats out of their countries, cut all flights to Qatar and are looking for ways to bar international airlines from flying through their airspace to get to Qatar, which is slated to host to 2022 World Cup. The UAE announced Wednesday that expressing sympathy, inclination or favoritism toward Qatar is punishable by three to 15 years in prison, alongside a minimum fine of 500, 000 dirhams, about $136, 000. Saudi Arabia has shut the only land border to Qatar, through which the country of 300, 000 gets as much as 40% of its food supply, leading to empty shelves in supermarkets and fears that food and water will soon run out."
VIDEO: Trump Stabbed to Death During Shakespeare in the Park Performance of Julius Caesar,Breitbart,Daniel Nussbaum,6/7/2017,"Video has emerged of the graphic, onstage stabbing of the Donald   Julius Caesar character in the latest Shakespeare in the Park production in New York Citys Central Park. [Inside Edition posted the video on its website Wednesday. The brief clip shows Caesar (actor Gregg Henry) bearing a striking resemblance to the president in a business suit, tie and slicked blonde hair, as he is brutally stabbed by his associates in the Senate.  The contemporary take on the Shakespeare classic     which opened May 23 and will run until June 18 at Central Parks Delacorte Theater     has sparked controversy for its portrayal of the mock assassination of the president.  To be honest I thought it was shocking and distasteful, Laura Shaeffer, who caught a performance of the play, told Mediaite this week. If this had happened to any other president     even as recently as Barack Obama or George W. Bush     it would not have flown. People would have been horrified.  I dont love President Trump, but hes the president. You cant assassinate him on a stage, she added. The play reportedly makes a number of references to Trump, though it does not refer to the president by name. Caesars wife Calpurnia (actress Tina Benko) reportedly speaks with a Slavic accent similar to that of First Lady Melania Trump, while Caesar himself is shown tweeting from a bathtub. The   Caesar character is also reportedly shown fully naked onstage the website for the Public   play cautions that it contains violence, nudity, and live gunshot sounds in addition to the use of strobe lights and haze effects. Julius Caesar is about how fragile democracy is, director Oskar Eustis wrote in a letter on the plays website. The institutions that we have grown up with, that we have inherited from the struggle of many generations of our ancestors, can be swept away in no time at all.

Red Sox Broadcaster Jerry Remy Thinks Foreign Players Shouldnt Use Translators,Breitbart,Dylan Gwinn,6/7/2017,"Tuesday turned out to be quite the day for the English language. [First, Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Mike Schmidt said that Philadelphias Odubel Herreras language barrier prevented him from becoming a player that the Phillies could build around. Then, Red Sox broadcaster Jerry Remy got in on the act.  During the middle innings of Tuesday nights game between the Yankees and the Red Sox, Yankees starter Masahiro Tanaka had a meeting on the mound with Yankees pitching coach Larry Rothschild, and Tanakas translator. Tanaka, who hails from Japan, needs the translator because he doesnt speak English. Shortly after Tanakas translator walked off the mound, Remy   on the subject of foreign players using translators. Remy said, I dont think that should be legal. I really dont.  What is it you dont like about that? asked Red Sox    announcer Dave OBrien. Learn baseball language, Remy said. Its pretty simple. You break it down pretty easy between pitching coach and pitcher after a long period of time.  Its unknown if Remy made these comments because of Schmidts earlier remarks. Its impossible to imagine that Remy wasnt aware of them. Either way, this seems like a perfectly stupid thing to say. Who cares whether or not the guy uses a translator? Learn baseball language? If signs, and a couple carefully selected words were all that was needed to communicate with a pitcher, then managers and pitching coaches would never go to the mound, and would just give signals from the dugout. By definition, if the team ventures out to the mound, unless theyre just stalling for time, it means something needed to be said which required actual conversation. If the player and the coach dont speak the same language, thats a problem. Masahiro Tanaka isnt some refugee, or illegal alien attempting to make America become more like Japan. Hes a baseball player, being paid $155 million dollars to win baseball games. Something he hasnt done a whole lot of this year. Thats a bigger problem. One obvious enough that it doesnt require a translator. Follow Dylan Gwinn on Twitter: @themightygwinn"
"James Comey Corroborates Trump Not Under Investigation, Did Not Pressure Him to Drop Russia Probe",Breitbart,Kristina Wong,6/7/2017,"The Senate intelligence committee released on Wednesday remarks prepared by former FBI Director James Comey for delivery the next day. [In the prepared remarks, Comey confirms that he told Trump he was not under FBI investigation multiple times, as Trump has asserted.  Comey said he told the president on January 6, January 27, and on March 30 that he was not under investigation. They also show that Trump had never pressured Comey to drop the FBIs investigation of whether there was any collusion between his campaign and Russia. In fact, according to Comey, Trump had said it would be good to find out of there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong. In his remarks, Comey clarified conversations with Trump that his associates relayed to the media     which showed Trump never demanded loyalty or pressured him to drop any investigation on Flynn or the broader Russia. According to a May 11 New York Times report, Trump had told Comey he needed his loyalty.  The headline read, In a Private Dinner, Trump Demanded Loyalty. Comey Demurred.  However, according to Comeys account, Trump never asked Comey to pledge his loyalty, and Comey never refused, as the Times reported. Trump had, according to the account, said, I need loyalty. I expect loyalty.  Comey said he did not respond to the comment. Later in the conversation, he said Trump said again, I need loyalty, and that he responded, You will always get honesty from me.  He said the president then said, Thats what I want, honest loyalty, to which Comey said, You will get that from me.  Comey said he was not sure what the president meant, and he did not ask, leaving it unclear as to what Trump actually wanted from him and what he meant by loyalty, and in what context. As the Times also noted in the report, Throughout his career, Mr. Trump has made loyalty from the people who work for him a key priority, often discharging employees he considers insufficiently reliable.  Comey also provided more context to a conversation he had with Trump on February 14, in which the president reportedly asked him to drop the FBI investigation on his former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, whom he had dismissed the day before. The Washington Post ran an article on May 16 that was headlined, Notes made by FBI Director Comey say Trump pressured him to end Flynn probe.  However, Comeys account makes it far from clear that he was ever pressured.  Comey said the president said, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  Comey said the president then turned to the subject of leaks. Comey did not say whether he responded to the presidents comment, which he characterized as a request.  A White House statement at the time said, the president has never asked Mr. Comey or anyone else to end an investigation, including any investigation involving General Flynn.  Comey also clarified that he understood the presidents comment as a request that any investigation of Flynn be dropped     but not the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign.  The former FBI director also addressed why he did not tell anyone outside of senior FBI leadership about the Presidents comment. He said he did not pass on that information to others in the FBI because he didnt want to infect the investigative team, and because he did not intend to abide by the request. He also said he had nothing to corroborate his story (which he still does not) and that he didnt tell Attorney General Jeff Sessions because Sessions was expected to recuse himself from the investigation. They also decided not to tell the deputy attorney general, who would not long be there in that role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed, he said. Comey said the investigation actually moved ahead at full speed.  Comey does not explain why he never told anyone in Congress, including congressional committees that oversee the FBI. He will likely be asked on Thursday why he did not come to Congress. In fact, he told Sen. Mazie Hirono ( ) last month that a situation where the FBI was told to stop something for a political reason has not happened in my experience.  Comey said Trump had called him on March 30 and said the Russia investigation was like a cloud impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country, and asked what the FBI could do to lift the cloud.  Comey said he told him they were investigating the matter as quickly as they could. He said he again told Trump he was not being personally investigated. He said Trump had repeatedly told him, We need to get that fact out.  Comey said he did not tell the president that the FBI and Justice Department were reluctant to do that, since that would create a duty to correct the record if things changed, but that he would see what we could do to lift the cloud. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could, he said. Comey also said he called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente for guidance, but he never received a call back. Trump would call back two weeks later asking what he had done to make it clear that he was not personally under investigation. Comey said Trump said he would have his people reach out to Boente, and that he told the President that was the way to go. Comey said Trump said he would do that and added, Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know.  But Comey said he wasnt sure what the President meant. That was the last time I spoke with President Trump, Comey said."
"James Comey Testimony Proves Trump Right, CNN Wrong - Breitbart",Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/7/2017,"The prepared written testimony that former FBI Director James Comey is set to deliver on Thursday morning vindicates President Donald Trumps claim that he was told three times that he was not under investigation. [At the same time, the Comey testimony refutes reports by CNN and other outlets that Comey would dispute that claim.  When Trump fired Comey, he wrote: While I greatly appreciate you informing me, on three separate occasions, that I am not under investigation, I nevertheless concur with the judgment of the Department of Justice that you are not able to effectively lead the Bureau.  As Zero Hedge noted Wednesday, CNN reported on Tuesday that Comey was expected to refute Trump.  Citing an anonymous source, CNN reported that Comey is expected to explain to senators that those were much more nuanced conversations from which Trump concluded that he was not under investigation.  Zero Hedge adds that CNNs chief political analyst Gloria Borger, said: Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if hes asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that he will be. He will say he never assured Donald Trump that he was not under investigation, that that would have been improper for him to do so.  However, Comey acknowledges in his prepared testimony that he did, in fact, tell Trump three times that he was not under investigation: once in a meeting at Trump Tower on January 6 a second time during a dinner on January 27 (which CNN says was more nuanced) and a third time during a telephone conversation on March 30. On a fourth occasion, in a phone call on April 11, the president said that he was not under investigation, and was not corrected. CNN has now added a correction to the top of its story: CORRECTION AND UPDATE: This article was published before Comey released his prepared opening statement. The article and headline have been corrected to reflect that Comey does not directly dispute that Trump was told multiple times he was not under investigation in his prepared testimony released after this story was published. Coreys written testimony contradicts Trumps account of events in one respect     namely, that Trump asked Comey for his loyalty.  However, Comeys prepared remarks add a new revelation, which is that Comey agreed to provide honest loyalty.  He speculates that it is possible that he had a different understanding of that phrase than the president did. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

"KASSAM: London Cops Arrest Dozens for Hate Crimes Since London Attack, But Mayor Says Police Cant Afford to Track Jihadists",Breitbart,Raheem Kassam,6/7/2017,"The Metropolitan Police have arrested 25 people since Saturdays terror attacks, using hate crime legislation to crack down on words and actions deemed either offensive, or which target people because of their race, religion, sexual orientation or disability. [Speaking on Thursday, Chief Superintendent Dave Stringer, the head of Community Engagement for the Metropolitan Police, said:  Since Saturday evenings attacks, we have increased the number of officers on the streets and in communities to reassure local people that they are able to go about their daily lives in peace and without fear of harassment or intimidation. Dedicated ward officers have also made contact with their local places of worship to encourage them to report hate crimes and to reassure those who congregate there that the police will take these crimes seriously. The Metropolitan Police has made 25 arrests for hate crime offences since Saturday. The news comes as London Mayor Sadiq Khan told Piers Morgan in an interview that Londons police did not have enough resources to monitor the jihadists returning to the United Kingdom from Syria and Iraq. He said in an interview Wednesday morning: I cant follow 400 people       the Met Police budget, roughly   per cent comes from me, the Mayor. The rest is funded by central government. If the Met Police budget is being shrunk and reduced, theyve got to prioritise and use their resources in a sensible, savvy way.  Asked what could be a bigger priority than tracking jihadists in the UKs capital city, Mr. Khan declined to answer.  Now, however, it seems we are learning of the Mets priorities. The force boasted on Thursday of the large amount of resources they dedicate to policing hate crime. A statement from the police said: All hate crimes are reviewed by a Detective Inspector and the MPS has also increased specialist investigators within the 32 London borough community safety units by 30 per cent, with more than 900 specialist members of staff dedicated to investigating all hate crime and domestic abuse crimes. With the average salary of a police officer in London standing at around 38, 000, this means the force is dedicating around 35m of resources to hate crime policing.

Metropolitan Police (@metpoliceuk) June 7, 2017,  In February 2017, on the back of reductions in central government resource allocation, the mayors plans involved a loss of officers for the Met, which he then rowed back on, blaming central government, eventually finding 27m extra from Londons City Hall to allocate. Sadiq Khan said police were too stretched to follow returnee jihadists. But they can police words no problem. https:  .      Raheem  (@RaheemKassam) June 7, 2017,  The force also noted in its statement that it regards TellMAMA     a group which lost government funding after it was found they were artificially inflating hate crime numbers     as a reliable   for hate crime reporting. In 2014, TellMAMA lost its case with the Press Complaints Commission, when it objected to the original Telegraph reporting which revealed its dodgy figures. The Telegraph reported that many of their hate crime claims were exaggerations at best, and that out of the 212 Islamophobic incidents reported by Tell Mama, 57 per cent happened only online, with a further 16 per cent of incidents not being verified. Only eight per cent of incidents involved physical targeting, and no attacks were serious enough to require medical treatment. The group maintains a blog frequently criticising President Donald Trump,   campaigners such as the Center for Security Policys Frank Gaffney, and Breitbart. com. The Met Police statement adds: We have increased the number of hate crime liaison officers who are a single point of contact for all those who need support after reporting a hate crime and we have introduced an Online Hate Crime Hub to tackle hate crime on social media.

People Trump blocked on Twitter claim he violated their First Amendment rights,Business Insider,Mark Abadi,6/7/2017,"The lawyers of two Twitter users whose accounts were blocked   by President Donald Trump are demanding Trump unblock their   clients, accusing the president of violating their First   Amendment rights.     The @realDonaldTrump account blocked the two users this year   after they posted tweets mocking and criticizing the president,   the lawyers say.     This Twitter account operates as a designated public forum for   First Amendment purposes, and accordingly the     blocking of our clients is unconstitutional, the nonprofit   Knight First Amendment Institute wrote  to Trump on Tuesday.      We ask that you unblock them and any others who have been   blocked for similar reasons, it said.     One of the users cited in the letter, Holly OReilly, had her   account blocked after posting a  to one of Trumps tweets last month, according to   the letter.     In one tweet, she promoted the March for Truth, an     protest she said she helped organize. In another, she   posted a GIF of Pope Francis appearing uncomfortable   standing next to Trump, with the caption, This is pretty much   how the whole world sees you.     The other user, Joe Papp, was blocked   for a tweet of his that contained the hashtag   #fakeleader, the institute said.     In a  Knight Institute executive director Jameel Jaffer   acknowledged the uncharted legal territory his letter   was entering.     Though the architects of the Constitution surely didnt   contemplate presidential Twitter accounts, they understood that   the President must not be allowed to banish views from public   discourse simply because he finds them objectionable, Jaffer   said.     Having opened this forum to all comers, the President cant   exclude people from it merely because he dislikes what theyre   saying.        Whether the Knight Institutes argument would stand a chance in   court is a matter for debate     and First Amendment attorneys are   split on the issue.     Part of the issue hinges on whether Trumps personal social   media account amounts to a   public forum,   like an open   meeting. The Knight Institute said in   its letter that its arguments also apply to the presidents   official @POTUS account.     Frankly, I think thats somewhat of an open question that   needs to be resolved by the courts, First Amendment lawyer Lisa   Zycherman of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP told Business Insider.     Once you become an elected official, your social media account   is by an extension a forum for your constituents to engage with   you, she said.     But Marc Randazza, a First Amendment lawyer with the Randazza   Legal Group, said a presidents social media account isnt a   public forum, making the Knight Institutes argument meritless.     Im very expansionist when it comes to First Amendment rights,   Randazza told Business Insider. But this is a little bit of an   overreach to say its a First Amendment violation to block a   critic on Twitter.     Randazza also countered the comparison of Trumps Twitter   account to a town hall, opting for a different metaphor for the   presidents actions.     If somebody was talking to him and he stuck his   fingers in his ears and said, La la la, Im not   listening to you, thats not a First Amendment violation   either, he said.     You dont have a right to be listened to. You have a right to   speak, he said.     In a message to the Wall Street Journal, Ken Paulson, dean   of media and entertainment at Middle Tennessee State University,   called the Knight Institutes argument novel and   ambitious, but admitted it was a tough sell legally.     I do think municipalities that establish Facebook pages and   invite citizen input are in fact establishing public forums, but   Im not sure that Donald Trumps brief bursts of opinion are the   same thing,  according to The Journal.

The EU Commissions National Journalist Prize Against Discrimination was awarded to him for an article dealing with asylum seekers who are not entitled to medical care and who are therefore forced to seek medical care, as well as healthcare staff and others who still provide health care to asylum seekers, the Commission wrote in a statement. Eight years later, this Tuesday, the   journalist cried this is for Syria while hitting a policeman with a hammer in front of Frances most iconic cathedral.

"Iran Blames Saudi Arabia for Islamic State Parliament, Ayatollah Shrine Rampage - Breitbart",Breitbart,Frances Martel,6/7/2017,"The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) have accused Saudi Arabia of organizing an Islamic State attack on Irans Parliament and the shrine of the leader of the Iranian revolution, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. The Islamic State have officially taken responsibility for the attack. [At press time, Reuters reports that the IRGC say Saudi officials coordinated the attack, which left at least 12 dead and 42 wounded.  JUST IN: Irans revolutionary guards say Saudi Arabia was behind deadly attacks in Tehran     statement pic. twitter.      Reuters Top News (@Reuters) June 7, 2017,  The   Presse reports that the IRGC claim America is also involved in the attack in some way: #BREAKING Iran Guards claim US, Saudi involved in Tehran attacks,     AFP news agency (@AFP) June 7, 2017,  Let there be no doubt that we will take revenge for todays attacks in Tehran, on terrorists, their affiliates, and their supporters, Brigadier General Hossein Salami, the deputy commander of the IRGC, said in a statement, according to Russian propaganda outlet RT. Iranian state media responded to the attack by publishing articles quoting Saudi officials recent statements against Iran, implying that, at the very least, Saudi Arabia inspired the Sunni Islamic State terrorists to attack the centers of power in   Iran. An estimated eight percent of Iran is Sunni Muslim, compared to 89 percent Shiite. Saudi Arabias deputy crown prince Mohammed bin Salman in challenging remarks made a few weeks ago warned that his country would take the battle to Iranian soil, the   Fars News Agency recalled Wednesday morning. Bin Salman had reported noted in May that the Iranian government perceived Riyadh as a primary target for   terrorism, and said: We wont wait for the battle to be in Saudi Arabia. Instead, well work so that the battle is for them in Iran.  Fars also quoted Saudi Foreign Minister Adel   in a separate article, who told officials in France that reported indicated Iran was harboring   terrorists. According to Fars,   said Iran must be punished for what he claimed as interference in the region and support for terrorist organizations.    reportedly demanded Iran become a normal state, not a sponsor of terrorism, and abide by international law, in a report published hours before the Islamic State attack. The articles do note cite similar remarks from Iranian officials. In May, for example, Iranian Defense Minister Hossein Dehghan warned that Tehran would leave no area untouched of Saudi Arabia except Mecca and Medina, the holy cities, if Iran felt threatened. Irans Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has repeatedly claimed the United States, Israel, and the West created the Islamic State to keep the Middle East destabilized. In recent remarks, he mocked the West for losing control of what he claimed was their own creation: This is a fire that [Western powers] themselves ignited and now has backfired on them.  A combination of armed attackers and suicide bombers targeted the two locations in the Iranian capital Wednesday, with Iranian officials identifying one of the suicide attackers as female. The gunmen, dressed as women and carryingKalashnikov rifles, executed a siege on the Parliament that lasted four hours before Iranian law enforcement announced that they had killed all assailants.

"Israeli, American Jewish Leaders Slam UN Secretary-General For Occupation Statement",Breitbart,Deborah Danan,6/7/2017,"TEL AVIV     The   of the United Nations was roundly condemned Tuesday by both   and Israeli leaders for a statement slamming the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territories. [Marking the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War, Antnio Guterres issued a statement saying that the 1967 defensive war resulted in Israels occupation of the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza and the Syrian Golan and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians and Syrians that fueled recurring cycles of violence and retribution, while making no mention of Israels right to defend itself at the time against the threat of annihilation from combined Arab armies.  Ending the occupation that began in 1967 and achieving a negotiated   outcome is the only way to lay the foundations for enduring peace that meets Israeli security needs and Palestinian aspirations for statehood and sovereignty. It is the only way to achieve the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people, Guterres said. This occupation has imposed a heavy humanitarian and development burden on the Palestinian people, he added. Among them are generation after generation of Palestinians who have been compelled to grow up and live in ever more crowded refugee camps, many in abject poverty, and with little or no prospect of a better life for their children.  Israels ambassador to the UN, Danny Danon, accused the   of disseminating Palestinian misinformation.  Any attempt at a moral equivalency between killing innocent people and the building of homes is absurd, he said. It is preposterous to blame terror and violence in the Middle East on the one true democracy in the region, he said. The moment the Palestinian leadership abandons terror, ceases to incite against our people and finally returns to direct negotiations, then real progress can be made towards peace.  Danon later slammed UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad   for opening a session of the UN Human Rights Council by decrying Palestinian suffering. It comes as no surprise that he chose to spread lies about Israel before he even mentioned the massacres in Syria. The Commissioner has forgotten that it is his job to care for human rights throughout the world, not to incite against Israel, Danon said in a statement. Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely called on Guterres to correct the [UNs] distortion of occupation.  On the day when the UN sticks to the facts and ceases the misguided use of the term occupation it will restore its credibility as an organization founded to uphold justice and truth, she said in a statement. Israel is celebrating the 50th anniversary of the liberation of Jerusalem and Judea and Samaria, and these are the facts, she added. The   League (ADL) also slammed Guterres for what it described as an incomplete and misleading statement. We are troubled by the  s incomplete statement on the anniversary of the   War and urge him to clarify his remarks, ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement. While we share his desire for a return to negotiations to achieve a   solution, this anniversary cannot be viewed in a vacuum. It is grossly misleading to examine only the enduring effects of the war while ignoring the context in which the war took place     the belligerence of the Arab states in the spring of 1967, and the silence of the international community in the face of these threats and its failure to ensure the rights to free passage of international waterways.  Greenblatt added his appreciation for Guterres supportive statements on Israel, including recognizing the double standard with which Israel is treated at the UN, and his labeling as   the delegitimization of Israels right to exist.  We would have hoped that he would use this anniversary to address the Palestinian condition and call for peace and resolution in a   and historically accurate manner, Greenblatt concluded. The UN coordinator for humanitarian aid and development also marked the 50th anniversary of the Six Day War by condemning Israel. It should be obvious, but it bears repeating, that occupation is ugly, Robert Piper said in a statement released Tuesday. Living under foreign military rule for years on end, generates despair, suffocates initiative and leaves generations in a kind of political and economic limbo, he said."
Irans Revolutionary Guards blame Saudis for Tehran attacks,CNN,Angela Dewan,6/7/2017,"Tehran, Iran (CNN) Irans Revolutionary Guards say Saudi Arabia supported ISIS in the deadly twin attacks in Tehran on Wednesday, an accusation likely to infuriate the Saudi kingdom amid high tensions in the region. At least 12 people were killed when six attackers mounted simultaneous gun and suicide bomb assaults on Irans Parliament building and the tomb of the republics revolutionary founder, in one of the most audacious assaults to hit Tehran in decades. The targets were highly symbolic.   Saudi Arabia and   Iran have long had a sectarian feud. The rivals are on opposite sides of violent conflicts in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere, and given the tensions, Irans implication about the attack isnt a great shock. The ISIS media wing, Amaq, claimed fighters with the Islamic State carried out the assault. It was the first time that ISIS, a Sunni Muslim group fighting   militias in Syria, has claimed responsibility for an attack in Iran, which is predominantly Shiite. The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps vowed revenge for the attack, and tied it to the visit of US President Donald Trump to Saudi Arabia in May. World public opinion, especially in Iran, sees the fact that this terrorist act was perpetrated soon after the meeting of the US president with the heads of one of the reactionary regional states that has always supported . .. terrorists as to be very meaningful, the statement read, according to Irans   Fars news agency. The statement did not explicitly name Saudi Arabia, but the implication was clear.  It continued to say that the as ISISs claim of responsibility for the attacks showed the countrys complicity in this wild move. Trump issued a written statement saying he felt for Iranian civilians, but the government has itself to blame for the attack.  We grieve and pray for the innocent victims of the terrorist attacks in Iran, and for the Iranian people, who are going through such challenging times, Trump said. We underscore that states that sponsor terrorism risk falling victim to the evil they promote. The Revolutionary Guards accusation comes at a time of heightened   tensions following a regional rift with Qatar. Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Egypt and the United Arab Emirates cut ties with Qatar this week and has blocked several of the countrys media outlets. The rift was over comments allegedly made by Qatari Emir Sheikh Tamim Al Hamad Al Thani hailing Iran as an Islamic power and criticizing Trumps policy toward Tehran. The Emirs alleged comments appeared on Qatars official news agency, but Qatar said the website was hacked and the report fabricated by the culprits. Analysis: Unraveling the Qatar crisis: Sunni, Shia, Saudi, Iranian    and Trump, How the attacks unfolded, The attack shocked Tehran: Until now, Iran has largely escaped the regular assaults launched against other participants in Syrias civil war. In a region plagued by sectarian violence, residents of the capital have lived in a peaceful oasis. The violence began at about 10 a. m. local time (2 a. m. ET) when gunmen apparently dressed as women stormed the main gate of the Parliament building in central Tehran and opened fire, Deputy Interior Minister Mohammad Hossein Zolfaghari told state television. The attackers took a number of hostages and at least one detonated a suicide bomb. Sporadic gunfire was heard before Iranian authorities declared the situation under control about four hours later. All four attackers were killed by security forces, Fars reported. At the same time as the Parliament attack was launched, a shooting spree and suicide bombing targeted the Ayatollah Khomeini mausoleum about 25 kilometers (15 miles) away, on the southern outskirts of the Iranian capital. Fars reported that one person was arrested at the tomb. Gruesome video footage from inside Irans Parliament during the attack was published by Amaq and appears to have been filmed on a phone by one of the gunmen. The video opens by showing a quick shot of a man carrying an   rifle walking out of an office, while a bloodied body of a man lies on the office floor. Shots are then fired either at or near the body, even though it appears the victim is already dead. Attack is minor issue  Irans counterterrorism unit said that several terrorist groups had entered Tehran, though it did not say where they were from. Members of another group had been apprehended.  The speaker of the Parliament, Ali Larijani, attempted to play down the attack, describing it as a minor issue. As you know, some coward terrorists infiltrated a building . .. but they were seriously confronted, he said in a statement. This is a minor issue but reveals that the terrorists pursue  . Symbolic attack, The attackers chose symbolically significant targets for their assault. The tomb houses the body of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Islamic Republics founder and first supreme leader, and it is a popular destination for tourists and pilgrims. He led the revolution that overthrew the Shah in 1979 and was supreme leader for 10 years. The Parliament, the Islamic Consultative Assembly or Majlis, is Irans principal legislative body. It has 290 members, including women, and there are representatives of religious minorities including Christians, Zoroastrians and Jews.   Gun ownership is heavily controlled in Iran, raising speculation that the attackers smuggled weapons into the country. Last major attack in 2010, Iran    which is more than 90% Shiite     has been involved in military actions against Sunni terrorist groups such as ISIS, who regard Shiites as apostates, but such terror attacks in the country are rare.  Last year, Irans government said it thwarted one of the biggest plots by terror groups targeting Tehran and other major cities during the month of Ramadan. This years holy month started almost two weeks ago on May 26. The last major attack in Iran was in 2010 when a Sunni extremist group carried out a suicide attack against a mosque in   killing 39 people. Kurdish groups have carried out small scale attacks against Iranian security forces in the   of the country. Correction: Earlier versions of this article mischaracterized how long Saudi Arabia and Iran have had a sectarian feud."
South Korea suspends THAAD deployment,CNN,James Griffiths,6/7/2017,"Seoul (CNN) South Koreas new government has suspended the deployment of a controversial US missile defense system that strained relations with China and angered North Korea.  An official told CNN on Wednesday that while Seoul will not withdraw two launchers of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system that are already in action, four additional launchers will not be deployed until a   environmental impact assessment is completed.  During the recent election campaign, South Korean President Moon   called for the THAAD rollout to be halted and any decision about its future to be put before the countrys parliament.  Deployment of THAAD was agreed by his predecessor    disgraced President Park      and Washington. The system was declared partially operational a week before Moon was elected.  At the time, analysts said this was an attempt to force Moons hand and make it difficult for his government to withdraw the system from South Korea.  The THAAD rollout has been vociferously opposed by China, which fears it could be used to spy on its own defense and nuclear deterrent systems.  Relations between Seoul and Beijing have soured significantly as a result of its deployment, affecting South Korean businesses and Koreans living in China.  A spokesman for the Pentagon said the United States will work with the South Korean government throughout this process. The US trusts (South Koreas) stance that the THAAD deployment was an alliance decision and it will not be reversed, Navy Cmdr. Gary Ross said.  Gen. Mark Milley, US Army chief of staff, told the Senate Subcommittee on Defense that the system is essential to protect thousands of US troops in South Korea, as well as South Korean citizens. Well work through it, and at the end of the day I think the Republic of Korea will be properly supported by the United States, he said.   Delayed deployment, THAAD was not due to be fully operational until the end of the year. The environmental assessment    even if it ultimately permits deployment to continue    will likely delay this to at least 2018.  The system is designed to shoot down   and   ballistic missiles in the latter stages of their flight as they plunge toward their targets. While this means it cannot act against the type of   missiles North Korea has been testing in recent months, THAAD also includes a sophisticated radar that will fit into an overlapping series of US missile defense systems, including Aegis warships operating in the Pacific and Patriot missile batteries deployed in Japan. The radar could provide critical early tracking data to these missile interception systems, as well as those protecting Guam, the closest US territory to North Korea."
Top senator: The extent of Russias election attacks is much broader than has been reported,Business Insider,Natasha Bertrand,6/7/2017,"Sen. Mark Warner  on   Tuesday that the extent of Russias cyberattacks around the US   election was much broader than has been reported so far.     The comments from Warner, the ranking Democrat on the Senate   Intelligence Committee, came one day after    reported on a   National Security Agency document that   said hackers associated with Russias military intelligence   agency targeted a company with information on US voting software   days before the election.     The agency used the data to launch      cyberattacks on local government officials, according to the NSA   document.     Warner told USA Today that he was pushing intelligence agencies   to declassify the names of the states affected by those   cyberattacks so they could prepare for midterm elections in 2018.   The Senate Intelligence Committee is investigating Russias   election interference and whether any member of President Donald   Trumps campaign team colluded with Moscow to undermine Hillary   Clinton.     I really want to press the case, Warner said. This is not an   attempt to embarrass any state. This is a case to make sure that   the American public writ large realizes that if we dont get   ahead of this, this same kind of intervention could take place in   2018 and definitely will take place in 2020.      The  in August that up to 20%   of US voters would use a digital system without a paper trail to   cast votes on November 8, and 42 states would use voting machines   that were at least a decade old and had outdated hardware and   software.     The NSA document offers the clearest indication yet that Russian   hackers sought to penetrate US voting systems tied to voter   registration in the days and weeks leading up to the election.   And its most likely just the tip of the iceberg, said Jeff   Bardin, the chief intelligence officer at the cybersecurity firm   Treadstone 71.     This was the Russians way of seeing what they could get access   to, Bardin said in an interview. They realized they could get   access to the voting registration systems, which can have an   impact on state elections and primaries. And this was only one   NSA report about one [hacked] system.     If the Russians were going after this system, how many others   could they have gone after? Bardin added.     The NSA document     which the Justice Department says was stolen   and leaked to The Intercept by a    government   contractor from Georgia     concluded that Russian intelligence   obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple US state   or local electoral boards in the days leading up to the   election.     The NSA did not draw any conclusions about whether the effort had   an effect on the elections outcome. The agency declined to   comment when reached by Business Insider on Monday.     But according to the NSA report, evidence that the hackers were   also stealing the login credentials of people with administrative   access to the   systems raises concerns that the   Russians were able to do anything they wanted     including,   Bardin said, breaching voting machines.     It is possible, Bardin said. The   systems   they hacked would just have to have some tie back into the actual   voting machine.  Sen. Mark Warner told USA Today on Tuesday that. .."

Russian fake news may be behind the Middle East crisis involving a major US ally,Business Insider,David Choi,6/7/2017,"Russian hackers are believed to have breached Qatars state news   agency in order to plant a fabricated news story that may have   influenced the diplomatic crisis in the Middle East, .     US authorities said Russias goal may have been to sow discord   between the US and its allies in the region.     Intelligence from US agencies signaled that Russian hackers were   involved in the first cyberattack two weeks ago. Since then, a   team of FBI investigators have been sent to Qatars capital city   of Doha to assist the Qataris in the investigation, according to   Qatari and US officials.     Although US officials pointed to Russia as the source of the   hacking, it has yet to be determined whether the latest incident   was traced back to criminal organizations in Russia or Russian   military intelligence units, such as the GRU. However, as one   unnamed official in CNNs report said, based on previous   intelligence on Russias   activities, not much   happens in that country without the blessing of the government,   the official said.     On May 23, the Qatar News Agency published a story that they   alleged was falsely attributed to the countrys emir, Sheikh   Tamim bin Hamad  . The story quoted him questioning the   fate of Donald Trumps presidency and the US hostility toward   Iran, Qatars ally and adversary to other nations in the Gulf,   such as Saudi Arabia.      The  quoted the emir as saying There is no   wisdom in harboring hostility towards Iran. Qatar said that   report and the quote attributed to the emir were false.     Since the publication, Qatar has called the report a shameful   cybercrime. The rift between Qatar and nations like Bahrain,   Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates also reached a   diplomatic low this week, after they announced they would   withdraw their diplomatic staff from Qatar and suspend flights in   the region.     Whatever has been thrown as an accusation is all based on   misinformation and we think that the entire crisis being based on   misinformation, Qatari Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed Bin   Abdulrahman   told CNN. Because it was started based on   fabricated news, being wedged and being inserted in our national   news agency which was hacked and proved by the FBI.     As a key staging ground for US forces, Qatar contains several   military bases for the US, including US Central Commands   headquarters in the Middle East.     I think this is very dangerous, said Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida   on CNN. This is something the world community needs to be on   notice. When another country can cause this kind of a havoc and   break diplomatic ties . .. this is something we all need to come   to the table and negotiate these things.

California Democrat Who Cheered Turkey Coup Wants to Impeach Trump - Breitbart,Breitbart,Joel B. Pollak,6/7/2017,"Rep. Brad Sherman ( ) joined a fledgling effort to impeach President Donald Trump on Wednesday     even before former FBI director James Comey was set to testify on Capitol Hill on Thursday. [The standard for high crimes and misdemeanors has been met, Sherman declared to reporters, according to The Hill. He did not explain, apparently, what crimes Trump had actually committed.  In fact, Sherman seemed to admit that the evidence against Trump was flimsy: If articles of impeachment based on obstruction of justice were on the floor of the House today, they would not succeed, he told The Hill. Nevertheless, he said, he planned to draft one article of impeachment to   a process that he said would accelerate over time. Sherman is working with Rep. Al Green ( ) who is also submitting articles of impeachment to the House. Another California Democrat who has led calls for Trumps impeachment is Rep. Maxine Waters ( ). Waters was spotted in the business class section of a flight from Los Angeles to Dulles International Airport on Tuesday evening, but declined to be interviewed by Breitbart News. Last year, Sherman found himself in trouble after he appeared to endorse a coup attempt against Turkeys President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Military takeover in Turkey will hopefully lead to real democracy     not Erdogan Authoritarianism, he tweeted at the time. As the coup effort faltered, Sherman had to scramble to explain himself. Evidently, Sherman hopes his prospects for removing a president from power will be brighter this time. However, Comey is not expected to offer any evidence that Trump tried to obstruct justice. In fact, a written version of his prepared remarks indicates that Comey will corroborate Trumps claim that he told the president he was not under FBI investigation. Comey is also expected to describe his discomfort with being asked for his loyalty by the president. Joel B. Pollak is Senior    at Breitbart News.

Donald Trump Floats Idea of Border Wall Covered with Solar Panels,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/7/2017,"President Donald Trump, during his meeting with Congress on Tuesday, floated the idea of having his Southern border wall covered with solar panels. [Trump suggested that he could build a wall 40 to 50 feet high and covered with solar panels, according to a report from Axios.  The energy generated from the solar panels could be used to pay for the cost of building the wall, Trump intimated, according to three sources in the story. It is unclear how serious the president was about the proposal, but he appeared eager to discuss progress for the project. The wall will be a great help, and it will happen believe me, Trump said to reporters after the meeting."
Donald Trump: Obamacare One of the Biggest Broken Promises in History of Politics - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/7/2017,"President Donald Trump thundered against Obamacare in Ohio on Wednesday, calling it one of the biggest broken promises in the history of politics. [The president met with families who had their lives upended by Obamacare, addressing reporters at the Ohio airport before his infrastructure speech.  Obamacare is dead, Ive been saying it for a long time, everybody knows it, everybody that wants to report fairly about it does, Trump said. He delivered a speech after Anthem announced that they were pulling out of the health care exchanges in Ohio, due to prohibitive costs to the company. Thats it,  . Wave  Trump said. What a mess.  Trump commented during his speech that Democrats suffered immensely politically for their actions, as they were voted out of office. Thats why they lost the House. They lost the Senate. They lost the White House, he said. Trump warned both parties in Congress to pass an Obamacare replacement quickly, and commented that Senate Majority Mitch McConnell was working to get a proposal finished as soon as possible. He specifically called out Democrats for trying to stop Republican efforts to fix the problem. Were having no help, its only obstruction from the Democrats, Trump said. The Democrats are destroying health care in this country.  He added that the eventual bill would be a strictly Republican effort. Republicans or bust, he said."
Donald Trump Nominates Christopher Wray to Lead FBI,Breitbart,Charlie Spiering,6/7/2017,"President Donald Trump has nominated Christopher Wray as the new FBI director. [I will be nominating Christopher A. Wray, a man of impeccable credentials, to be the new Director of the FBI, the president announced on Twitter on Wednesday morning. Details to follow.   Wray served as the Associate Deputy Attorney General in former President George W.

He also served as Governor Chris Christies personal attorney during the bridgegate scandal. Last week, Christie praised Wray as an outstanding lawyer, after it was revealed that he was under consideration. He has absolute integrity and honesty, and I think that the president certainly would not be making a mistake if he asked Chris Wray to be FBI director, Christie said.

F*ck the Police 2017: Ice Cube Blasts Officers in New Song Good Cop Bad Cop,Breitbart,Jerome Hudson,6/7/2017,"Police officers in the United States are   on brutalizing minorities, accuses Ice Cube in the latest single off of his Death Certificate: 25th Anniversary album. [The song Good Cop Bad Cop sees the California rapper paint the picture of   America as being filled with crooked cops targeting minorities, falsifying police reports, planting evidence, and doing anything they can to send another young brother to jail.  Black Lives Matter, its not chit chatter. Cause all they wanna do is scatter brain matter. A mind is a terrible thing to waste. A nine is terrible in your face, Cube raps. The political track sees Cube question if a good cop is just a fantasy.  The songs hook also presents a racially charged scenario that sees the black police showin out for the white cop and the white police showin out for the black cop.  In an interview this week with Apples Beats 1 Radio host Zane Lowe, Cube described Good Cop Bad Cop as a   F*ck tha Police 2017, and explained why he decided to release the updated take on the controversial 1988 song. We had done F*ck tha Police so many years ago, he said of the N. W. A. song. With the emergence of Straight Outta Compton the movie, we realized that its still the same thing thats going on. We needed a more    version of the community talking to the police and to the authorities.  Despite how the song seems to broadly brand law enforcement officers as racist, Cube says it is an appeal to the good cops to turn in the bad cops.  Thats the first line of defense for us is for good cops to get the bad apples out of the bunch. Because theyre sucking all the respect that police used to have is being sucked away by these bad apples, he said. Last year, however, Cube said he would not stop performing the   enforcement song F*ck tha Police.  In that same Beats 1 Radio interview, Cube also said President Donald Trumps policies are hurting poor people the same way George W. Bushs did. The same weight under a Trump Administration is starting to feel the same way as it did when daddy Bush was in the White House, the rapper said. It was the weight of all those policies geared against poor people who were trying to pull themselves up. I feel like that same attack is happening against the most poor and vulnerable people. That same ugliness is starting to rear its head again.  Ice Cube is scheduled to appear on Fridays episode of HBOs Real Time as a replacement for Sen. Al Franken, who cancelled his appearance after host Bill Mahers use of a racial slur on the show last week.   Follow Jerome Hudson on Twitter @jeromeehudson"
Report: PETA Produced Fake Animal Abuse Video as Part of Attempted Viral Awareness Campaign - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/7/2017,"PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) has reportedly produced a fake animal abuse video to raise awareness of the issue online. [The animal rights group has produced a disturbing new video that depicts a cat suffering at the hands of its owner. Its difficult to watch. Its also completely fake, reports Mashable. But it looks real it is a skilled CGI work clearly meant to deceive viewers. Now, PETA is trying to enlist complicit media organizations to knowingly publish the fake video in an effort to make the lie go viral.   Through this marketing effort, PETA is trying to convince the media to report and share a fake video as if its real, in hopes of deceiving the public to create manufactured outrage, Mashable continued. As animal lovers, this is offensive. As a media outlet with a responsibility to truthfulness, this is unethical. As people with basic moral values, WTF? Mashable claims PETAs involvement in the fake video is shown in a    clip that was also emailed to them by a public relations firm allegedly working with the animal activists: What wed like to do is have Mashable debut this video of a cat, created with   imagery (CGI) being abused, which will have been planted on YouTube anonymously by the ad agency who created it for PETA. Your posting of the provocative piece would simply be to acknowledge that its in circulation     not to make any claims about its authenticity.        When the video has drawn the critical response and the number of views were anticipating (ideally, into the millions) we would then have you reveal to the world that the cat was NOT harmed, but was actually created with CGI by posting this    video. It reveals the reasons for the creation of the first video and asks people to avoid circuses that use lions, tigers, or any other live animals. Mashable called the plan to create a viral video wrong and irresponsible, while one Twitter user called them unethical for the trick. Anyone surprised? asked Daily Mail U.

"Shaun King, The Nations Whitest Black Activist, Boycotts NFL for Bigotry and Anti-Blackness",Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/7/2017,"On Tuesday, Shaun King, the senior justice writer for the New York Daily News, announced his boycott of the National Football League. The former black lives matter spokesman, deposed after the discovery that he is white and not the African American he claimed to be, accused the NFL of being bigoted against black people because it hasnt hired   protester Colin Kaepernick. [King made his proclamation after it became clear that American anthem protester and former San Francisco 49ers   quarterback Colin Kaepernick would not find a team to take him on after he became a free agent at the tail of last season.  Kaepernick spent the entirety of the   season refusing to stand for the national anthem and spoke out against the U. S. A. our police, soldiers, and other first responders. He also repeatedly said the country was never great.  But after the season ended, in February the player announced both his free agency and an end to his     protests. But despite his new status and his pledge to end his embarrassing protests, Kaepernick has not been able to find a team to hire him for the coming football season. His inability to find a berth has sparked numerous protests by   fans and   sports reporters alike. Kaepernick was even the subject of a politicians decree when a   socialist Seattle City Council member wrote an open letter demanding that the Seattle Seahawks bring him on. The demands ultimately fell on deaf ears. With Kaepernick left out in the cold,   football fan Shaun King now says he cant watch football anymore. I cant, in good conscience, support this league, with many of its   owners, as it blacklists my friend and brother Colin Kaepernick for taking a silent, peaceful stance against injustice and police brutality in America, King blathered in his June 6 column. Its disgusting and has absolutely nothing to do with football and everything to do with penalizing a brilliant young man for the principled stance he took last season.  The white man who posed as a black man for a decade fulminated at Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll for turning his back on Kaepernick and signing white quarterback Austin Davis instead. King labeled Davis a scrub over the incident. King, who admitted that he lied about being black, went on to rail at the Seahawks for hiring Davis who has far fewer accomplishments in the NFL than Kaepernick. The activist insisted that there could be only one reason that the Seahawks took a pass on Kaepernick: Its racism. Its bigotry. Its discrimination. Period. Its not football. Dont call it football. If you call the decisions by 32 teams to not sign this man a football decision, you dont know football and probably voted for Donald Trump. Nearly 100 quarterbacks   96, in fact   are usually signed to teams in the NFL. That Colin Kaepernick is not one of them is disgusting. Of course, hes one of the top 96 quarterbacks in the league. Kaepernicks longtime rival, Richard Sherman, said he believed Kaepernick was a   quarterback. King went on to add that the ridiculous fragility of the conservative white male fan base has kept Kaepernick on the sidelines. Finally, this very white black activist added that his decision was sealed when ESPN announced that it had rehired country singer Hank Williams, Jr. to once again sing his iconic Monday Night Football theme song at the start of each Monday game. Williams had been fired six years ago for being a conservative. Hank Williams, Jr. is basically Donald Trump with a guitar. Hes a bigot, King growled. Everybody knows it. His songs and statements have echoed bigotry for years, but now that Obama is out of office, hes back.  King continued, bellowing: Hank Williams, Jr. and Austin Davis are employed right now, and Colin Kaepernick isnt. Shame on this league for following Trumps lead in spirit, tone and now in actions. Im appalled. As a lifelong fan, Im deeply disappointed. What I do know is this   I cant support this product. Warming to his closing statements, King then blamed his little son for launching the boycott with a claim that his    boy told him they could no longer watch football, After what theyve done to Colin and with all of those owners loving Donald Trump so much.  So, in the face of all this purported injustice, King has set out on his road to boycotting the NFL: Maybe if Colin Kaepernick gets a deal, it would change my mind, but deep damage is already done. As a leader in the Black Lives Matter Movement, as a voice in the resistance to Donald Trump, and as a friend of Colin Kaepernick, I cannot, in good conscience, support the NFL any longer. If I did, Id struggle to look my own son in the eyes or look at myself in the mirror. As a reminder, King is boycotting a sports league that is almost 70 percent African American. It is a business where the average rookie salary is $365, 000 a year, a number that goes up by tens of thousands every year the player stays signed to an NFL team. It is also a league where the average players salary is about $1. 9 million annually. This is the same sports league that Shaun King says isnt black enough and is unfair and discriminatory to blacks. But, this is also a man who directly equates   to being tolerant and right thinking. Follow Warner Todd Huston on Twitter @warnerthuston or email the author at igcolonel@hotmail. com."
ESPN Ignores Part of Survey That Shows Viewers Do Think the Network is Too Liberal,Breitbart,Warner Todd Huston,6/7/2017,"On Monday, cable sports network ESPN breathlessly reported that a new survey it had commissioned and paid for proved that its viewers dont think the network has a problem with liberal bias. But now, a closer look at ESPNs own survey seems to show that the network completely ignored the part that said 63 percent thought the network was too liberal. [The new survey taken of ESPN viewers between May   was reported by ESPN Front Row on June 5. Network officials insisted that the survey proved that few of its viewers think the network is biased to the left. Network executives also said the perception of liberal bias has had no impact on its ratings.  The results of the Langer Research Associates survey, though, stand in stark contrast to two other surveys by two other companies not paid by ESPN for their work. The two other surveys found that ESPN has lost viewers who consider themselves   in political outlook. Regardless, ESPN claims that its new survey proves no one cares about its liberal bias. Though, a closer look at the survey seems to leave a major question about the veracity of ESPNs   proclamations. According to Sporting News, ESPN seems to have ignored the fact that its survey does, indeed, show that a large number of its viewers think the network is too liberal: One question in the survey of 1, 423 adults conducted from May   was whether they detect a political bias in ESPNs coverage. About 30 percent of the respondents said they detect bias within that group, 63 percent said its a liberal bias while 30 percent said its a conservative bias. The remaining 7 percent said they detect bias but declined to categorize it one way or the other. A look at ESPNs Monday announcement reveals that the network completely forgot to mention the 63 percent statistic. Sporting News asked ESPN why that particular statistic was left out of its press release. The network replied that they wanted to keep their press release short.  As more evidence that the network is very worried about the perception that it has a problem with liberal bias was confirmed by an insider who spoke to the website. The insider told Sporting News that the survey, the press release, and the rehiring of   country artist Hank Williams, Jr. was all just spin meant to paper over its liberal bias problem. Theyre responding to real criticism, but theres no real substance, the source said. Hank Williams is totally a PR move: We wont hire any conservative journalists, but well let Hank sing a song, the same song, for 16 weeks. The idea that theyre conducting research, and putting out press releases, shows theyre under siege and trying to counter.  The words of this anonymous insider seem to ring true when coupled with the other recent surveys that do show that the sports network has a liberal bias problem. In one case, a YouGov poll emerged in May showing that Republicans had abandoned ESPN in droves. The YouGov review, though, was an opinion poll and many dismissed it for its lack of hard numbers. Days later, a review of ESPN viewers in the Cincinnati, Ohio, market by TV research group Deep Root found that viewers from a   political viewpoint had stopped watching ESPN in significant numbers. Finally, a few weeks later, responding to criticism that its Cincinnati survey might not be representative of the country as a whole, Deep Root reviewed the data in 43 major TV markets across the nation and found that the Cincinnati results were reflected everywhere. According to Deep Root, ESPN has lost millions of viewers who consider themselves conservative or Republican. Why would these viewers have quit watching the network if they werent sick and tired of the constant liberal bias?

Oliver Stone: Megyn Kelly Didnt Know Her Stuff with Putin,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/7/2017,"NEW YORK (AP)     Film director Oliver Stone, whose series of conversations with Vladimir Putin air next week on Showtime, said he watched Megyn Kelly interview the Russian president on NBC and concluded that he knew his stuff and she didnt. [Kellys interview, which aired on the debut of her newsmagazine, Sunday Night with Megan Kelly, on Sunday, became   like, Stone said, and was an example of how American journalism frequently leaves little room for nuance.  I think she was attractive and she asked hardball questions, but she wasnt in position to debate or counter him, because she didnt know a lot of things, he said. NBC News President Noah Oppenheim shot back that no one here is interested in Oliver Stones unsolicited thoughts on Megyn Kellys appearance or his   opinion of her journalism.  But so long as were offering each other professional feedback, please let him know I dont think hes made a decent movie since the early 90s, he said. Putin was combative when asked in the NBC interview about hacking in the U. S. presidential election and relations between Russia and President Donald Trumps team. Hes more serene on Showtime, where more than a dozen interviews that Stone conducted with the Russian president between 2015 and early this year unfold one hour per night for four nights starting Monday. As an example of where he believed Kelly was mistaken, Stone said the claim that 17 U. S. intelligence agencies had concluded the Russians were behind election year hacking and used as a preface for a question had been walked back.  It was a reference to testimony from James Clapper, former director of national intelligence, about a hacking report by three specific agencies. The independent organization Politifact has produced a report that backs Kelly, however, because Clapper had earlier said that all 17 intelligence agencies he had supervised agreed about Russias involvement. Stone, a controversial figure who has interviewed Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez and produced a documentary backing Putins version of events in the Ukraine, conducts a Putin interview far less confrontational than Kellys, at least on the basis of two episodes provided for screening by Showtime. One critic, Marlow Stern in The Daily Beast, called in a wildly irresponsible love letter to Putin. The filmmakers style does include its share of ingratiating remarks. You have a lot of discipline, sir, he says at one point. You are an excellent CEO. Russia is your company, he says at another. Besides office   Putin is interviewed driving a car, walking through horse stables at his home and after he played in a hockey game. When Putin makes a claim about a letter he received from the CIA and Stone asks him to produce it, the Russian president says, My words are enough.  Yet Stone also challenges Putin on his authoritarian style and questions his claims of democratic reform. The filmmaker said in an interview that there are more direct questions about relations with the United States in the unseen third and fourth episodes. He asks Putin about assassination attempts and, while it was inadvertent in one case, captures a couple of   moments. Asked if he ever have bad days, Putin replies that I am not a woman so I dont have bad days, adding a reference to natural cycles affecting behavior. During a discussion about gay rights, Putin said about a homosexual male: I prefer not to go in the shower with him. Why provoke him? Stone is aware that hell receive criticism for not pushing Putin hard enough. Im not a journalist, he said. Im a filmmaker and I was taking a different approach.  The projects value comes in seeing Putin talking about his life and world view in an extended format, seeing the personal and political history that drives policy for the U. S.s biggest adversary, and simply how his mind works. At one point Stone asks Putin about a 13 percent inflation rate, and is quickly corrected. Twelve point nine, he said. Its crucial for the United States to understand another point of view, Stone said. Im interested in preventing a further deterioration in relations.  The film also features Stone screening a copy of the Cold   satire Dr. Strangelove for the   Russian leader. I pushed him where I felt he should be pushed, Stone said. At a certain point, you know that that person is not going to change his approach. Hes a leader. He thinks things through and hes made his point. I cant think of anything more that I could have said or done."

LinkedIn: Silicon Valley Plunges to 12th Most Attractive Job Market - Breitbart,Breitbart,Chriss W. Street,6/7/2017,"LinkedIns Workforce Report for June found that of the 20 largest U. S. metropolitan areas, Silicon Valley has plunged to 12th place in job attractiveness. [LinkedIn is Americas top job board, with 138 million workers posting profiles that can highlight over 50, 000 unique skill sets. With the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announcing on June 6 that its Job Openings And Labor Turnover (JOLTS) reached an   record of 6, 044, 000 million jobs available, over 3 million of those jobs were posted by 20, 000 companies on LinkedIn.  Workforces monthly report provides detailed data on the 20 most important metropolitan areas of the United States, including: Atlanta, Austin, Boston, Chicago,    . Worth Denver, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles,  . Lauderdale,  . Paul, Nashville, New York City, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Francisco Bay Area (Silicon Valley) Seattle, St. Louis, and Washington, DC. Workforces latest analysis of LinkedIn activity reveals that 1. 31 percent of its members took a new jobs during the month of May. That was up 2. 4 percent over the past twelve months, and the strongest month for hiring since June 2015. The industries generating the largest hiring increases in May included: architecture and engineering, up 21 percent aerospace, automotive, and transportation, up 19 percent manufacturing and industrial, up 19 percent and financial services and insurance, up 16 percent. Workforce has reported that Silicon Valley has consistently ranked near the top of metropolitan areas in job attractiveness due to a Skills Gap for experienced computer programmers, integrated circuit designers, and software developers driving up wages and signing bonuses. But the Workforce May report found that Silicon Valley plunged to #12 in job attractiveness, down another 2 notches since February. Workforce observed that only 20 percent of applicants for jobs posted on LinkedIn by Silicon Valley employers had the necessary skills to be hired in August. But over the last 9 months that percentage has jumped to 33 percent. That Skills Gap plunge explains why the percentage of LinkedIn members taking a new Silicon Valley job, usually for higher wages, dropped from 1. 4 percent a year ago to 1. 05 percent at the end of May. Workforce stated: In comparison, Seattle has seen net migration increase by 2% over the same period. Whats to blame? Cities like Seattle, Portland, Denver, Austin, and Charlotte are booming and theyre cheaper to live in.  Breitbart News reported in December that the   Geopolitical Futures Annual Forecast warned that after   of innovation and growth, the   microchip revolution will present huge economic and wage challenges for Americas   and  . Silicon Valley rode the   economic booms in personal computing, Internet, social engineering and clean energy. Google, Apple and Facebook stock prices are still hitting record highs, but Workforce reports that migration to the region has decreased by 17 percent since February."
Famed Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz: There are people in the White House trying everything to try and get him to stop tweeting,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/7/2017,"Legal experts were taken back by the level of potential     that President Donald Trump  about the controversial travel ban   currently blocked by the courts.     Trump, following the London terror attacks over the weekend,   tweeted on Monday: I am calling it what we need and what it is,   a TRAVEL BAN! He then took aim at his own Justice Department,   saying it should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not   the watered down, politically correct version it will likely   soon be arguing in favor of before the Supreme Court.     He also tweeted that the DOJ should ask for an expedited   hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court       & seek much tougher version! And he called the judicial   system slow and political.     Both supporters and opponents of the presidents travel ban were   stunned by what they saw as comments that could hurt the   DOJs defense of the executive order.     Neal Katyal,  arguing against the ban in court,   tweeted a screenshot of Trumps Monday morning tweets, commenting   that its kinda odd to have the defendant in Hawaii v. Trump   acting as our  . We dont need the help but will take   it! Ryan Goodman, a former Department of Defense lawyer in   President Barack Obamas administration, said the tweet calling   the second order watered down    unconstitutional intent.     And Jack Goldsmith, a lawyer in President George W. Bushs   administration, Harvard law professor, and cofounder of Lawfare,   highlighted a point he made in February after Trump took aim at   the judges presiding over travel ban litigation. Goldsmith wrote   then that Trump might be intentionally weakening his case to set   the scene to blame judges after an attack that has any   conceivable connection to immigration.     If Trump loses in court he credibly will say to the American   people that he tried and failed to create tighter immigration   controls, .   This will deflect blame for the attack. And it will also help   Trump to enhance his power after the attack.     Perhaps  came from George Conway, a prominent lawyer who is   married to top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway.      The lawyer, who withdrew himself from consideration for a top   Justice Department job,    that Trumps statements may make some [people] feel   better, but they certainly wont help the solicitor generals   office get a majority decision in the Supreme Court, which is   what actually matters.     Sad, he added.     He    explaining his views and clarifying that he VERY, VERY STRONGLY   supports Trump, his administration, policies, the executive order   itself, and of course, my wonderful wife. But he seemed to   plead with Trump to stop tweeting about the ban.     Every sensible lawyer in [the White House Counsels office] and   every political appointee at DOJ [would] agree with me (as some   have already told me). The [point] cannot be stressed enough that   tweets on legal matters seriously undermine Admin agenda and   POTUS     and those who support him, as I do, need to reinforce   that [point] and not be shy about it.     Trump didnt seem to follow that advice, tweeting again about the   executive order later Monday night.      Thats right, we need a TRAVEL BAN for certain DANGEROUS   countries, not some politically correct term that wont help us   protect our people! .     Renowned lawyer and Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz told   Business Insider on Tuesday that Trumps continued persistence in   going against the wishes of his own legal team is an   experience Dershowitz has had over and over again with   clients.     You tell them not to talk to the press, you tell them not to   call somebody and talk to them, they do, he said. When you have   a powerful person     I represent many powerful people     they dont   listen to their lawyers. They think that they know a lot.     Dershowitz said its clear Trump believes his tweeting was at a   major reason for his electoral victory in November, and hes   loathe to abandon the habit. Indeed, on Tuesday morning,   Trump tweeted that the FAKE MSM was working so hard trying to   get me not to use Social Media.     I think there is a sense that he got where he got by tweeting,   Dershowitz said. And how dare his lawyers tell him not to.   Theyre just too cautious and too watery and hes going to do his   own thing.     And then of course . ... the clients go why didnt you stop me!   Why didnt you stop me from doing that. Why didnt you tell me   not to!  Dershowitz said. So I think its a situation where the   most powerful person in the world is not going to be told   what to do by his lawyers.     The revised travel ban  from   Sudan, Iran, Somalia, Yemen, Syria, and Libya  from entering the country for 90 days while the   administration reviews its visa policies. It also bars all   refugee entry for 120 days. It has been blocked by federal   courts, and the Trump administration has appealed to the Supreme   Court.        In upholding a nationwide block on the order, the 4th US Circuit   Court of Appeals  drips with religious intolerance, animus, and   discrimination.     The Trump administration had withdrawn its initial travel ban       which did not make clear that existing visa holders could enter   the country and also included Iraq on the list of banned   countries     after it too was blocked by the courts.     Trumps tweets point in a different direction than what   his own DOJ lawyers argued in the case, as the Justice   Department has tried to distance itself from the original order   in defending the new one. Trump has already seen his past   statements, and those of his surrogates, used against him in   court, particularly his December 2015 call for a temporary   suspension of Muslims entering the US.     The Justice Department lawyers defending the order have   repeatedly called for Trumps statements not to be considered   when ruling on its legality, instead asking the judges to focus   on the text of the document. But that strategy has not proven   effective yet, as the courts have taken Trumps statements   into consideration.     Additionally, the lawyers have tried to create distance between   the first executive order and the one that replaced it, which   likely wasnt helped by Trumps tweets about its     nature.     But Dershowitz said he believes the latest tweets wont be a   detriment to a Supreme Court case     namely because he didnt   write the following two words: Muslim ban. He believes that   Trumps statements should not be considered in evaluating the   executive order. If Trumps statements are the reason for the   travel ban being ruled unconstitutional, Dershowitz said that   creates a scenario where a future president can present the   exact same document and have it deemed legal if that leader did   not use the same language in relation to the order.     You cant judge a statute by what people say about it, he said.   You have to judge it by its words. And I think the Supreme Court   will ultimately come to realize that.     But, Trumps not helping, he added.     And as its become apparent to Dershowitz, Trumps team is   desperately trying to get him to stop shooting himself in the   foot.     I think there are people in the White House     wouldnt be   surprised if [Kellyanne] Conway is one of them     who are trying   everything to try and get him to stop tweeting, he said,   pointing to George Conways message as one that gets to him.     At least one would think so, he added. Because they have to be   trying their best to stop this. And so far, they havent   succeeded.  Legal experts were taken back by the level. .."

Ann Coulter: All We Need Is Love ... and Deportations - Breitbart,Breitbart,Ann Coulter,6/7/2017,"In Britain, as in the U. S. when an Islamic terrorist is said to be, known to law enforcement, the translation is: He is being actively ignored by law enforcement. [After the latest terrorist attack in Britain     at least as of this writing     Prime Minister Theresa May bravely announced, Enough is enough!  What is the point of these macho proclamations after every terrorist attack? Nothing will be done to stop the next attack. Political correctness prohibits us from doing anything that might stop it. Poland doesnt admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. Japan doesnt admit Muslims: It has no terrorism. The United Kingdom and the United States used to have very few Muslims: They used to have almost no terrorism. (One notable exception was chosen as the National Freedom Hero in this years Puerto Rican parade in New York!) Notwithstanding the lovely Muslim shopkeeper who wouldnt hurt a fly, everyone knows that with every tranche of   Muslims we bring in, were also getting some number of   killers. Former Prime Minister Tony Blair dumped millions of Third World Muslims on Britain to force multiculturalism on the country. Now Britons are living with the result. Since the   attack, every U. S. president has done the same. President Bush admitted Muslim immigrants at a faster pace after   than we had been doing before  . Whatever the   attackers intended to accomplish, I bet they didnt expect that. Now we cant get rid of them. Under the rules of political correctness, Western countries are prohibited from even pausing our breakneck importation of Muslims, much less sending the recent arrivals home. In defense of the poor saps responding to every terrorist attack with flowers, candles and hashtags, these are people who have no ability to do anything else. Western leaders are in full possession of the tools to end Islamic terrorism in their own countries, just as their forebears once ended Nazi Stormtroopers. Unable to summon the backbone to defeat the current enemy, the West is stuck constantly reliving that glorious time when they whipped the Nazis. In almost every Western country     except the one with an increasingly beleaguered First Amendment     its against the law to deny the Holocaust. Are we really worried about a resurgence of Nazism? Isnt Islamic terrorism a little higher on our immediate problems list? How about making it illegal to make statements in support of ISIS,   female genital mutilation, Sharia law or any act of terrorism? The country with a First Amendment cant do that     the most that amendment allows us to do is ban conservative speakers from every college campus in the nation. But if our elected representatives really cared about stopping the next terrorist attack, instead of merely watching those on the watch list, theyd deport them. To this day, we have a whole office at the Department of Justice dedicated to finding and deporting Nazis even without proof they personally committed crimes against Jews. But we cant manage to deport hearty young Muslims who post love notes to ISIS on their Facebook pages. If the Clinton administration had merely enforced laws on the books against an Afghani immigrant, Mir Seddique Mateen, and excluded him based on his   list of terrorist affiliations, his son Omar wouldnt have been around to slaughter 49 people at an Orlando nightclub last year. If Secretary of State John Kerry, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson or anyone else in our vaunted immigration vetting system had done his job, Pakistani Tashfeen Malik never would have been admitted to this country to commit mass murder in San Bernardino a year after she arrived. Before being warmly welcomed by the U. S. Maliks social media posts were bristling with hatred of America and enthusiasm for jihad. Were already paying a battery of FBI agents to follow every Muslim refugee around the country. When they find out that one of them lists his hobby as jihad, we need them to stop watching and start deporting. Paul Ryan, Mitch McConnell, the rest of the useless GOP     and obviously every Democrat     have the blood of the next terrorist attack on their hands if they dont make crystal clear that admiring remarks about Islamic terrorism is a deportable act. But they wont do it. Thats not who we are, as Ryan famously said. True, most Muslims are peaceful. Guess what? Most Nazis were peaceful! We didnt knock ourselves out to admit as many of them as we could, screening out only the Nazis convicted of mass murder. Before we were even formally involved in World War II, the FBI was all over the German American Bund. No one worried about upsetting our German neighbors. (Perhaps because they knew these were Germans and wouldnt start bombing things and shooting people.) But today, our official position is: Lets choose love so as not to scare our Muslim neighbors. Isnt that precisely what we want to do? Facing an immobile government, two British men     by which I mean British men     were sentenced to PRISON for putting bacon on a mosque in Bristol last year. One died in prison just after Christmas, an ancient religious holiday recently replaced by Ramadan. If we cant look askance at Muslims without committing a hate crime, cant we at least stop admitting ever more refugees, some percentage of whom are going to be terrorists and 100 percent of whom will consume massive amounts of government resources? No, thats not who we are.  Until any Western leader is willing to reduce the number of Muslims in our midst, could they spare us the big talk? We surrender would at least have the virtue of honesty."
Trump pitched solar panels for his border wall to help cover the costs,Business Insider,Madeleine Sheehan Perkins,6/7/2017,"In a meeting Tuesday with Republican leaders, Trump reportedly   suggested putting solar panels on the proposed   border   wall, and letting the generated electricity from the panels cover   some of the costs.     Citing three people with direct knowledge of the talks on   Tuesday, Axios  Trump wanted the wall to be 40 to 50 feet tall, and   covered with solar panels. According to the report, Trump called   such a wall, which is intended to prevent people from entering   the US illegally, a beautiful structure.     Trump reportedly told the Republican lawmakers they were free to   talk about the wall as long as they credited him with the solar   panels idea, however it was unclear whether the proposal was   under serious consideration.     Trumps pitch is similar to one the  reported on in April that was submitted to   the government by Gleason Partners of Las Vegas. That company   said solar panels on a border wall could pay for the wall within   20 years through energy sales to the US and Mexico. Electricity   generated from the panels would provide for lighting, sensors   and patrol stations along the wall, the Associated Press   reported.

DELINGPOLE: Paris - Trump Just Dodged A $2.5 Trillion Bullet,Breitbart,James Delingpole,6/7/2017,"Heres more evidence that Trump did the right thing by pulling out of the UNs Paris climate agreement. [Had the U. S. stayed in it would have been on the hook for a fair chunk of this   pay demand from India.   Yes, you read that right. Not billion but trillion. Thats $2, 500, 000, 000, 000 which India was expecting to be paid over the next 15 years by the Western nations     ie mainly the U. S.     as a bribe for pretending to decarbonize its economy in line with the U. N. Paris agreement. And, inevitably, it wasnt just India that wanted its climate Danegeld. So did every other country which could qualify for developing world status. Here, courtesy of Chris Horner, is a document from U. S. climate negotiator Todd Stern. He clearly thinks its funny, though Im not sure I would if I were a taxpayer having to fund it       In other words, Paris was never really about climate. It was a   scheme in which rich nations were expected to shower poor nations with free money. Totally about UN socialist wealth redistribution. #IPCC pic. twitter.      Brad Rush (@OtagoGrad) June 7, 2017,  This, of course, is the real reason for the widespread global outrage at Trumps climate decision. The pigs have had their enormous trough     stamped $$$$ courtesy of Uncle Sam     pulled from beneath their snouts and their instinctive response is to go Sooooooeeeeee! Soooooeeeeee! My two favorite deranged responses so far. This one from The Nation explaining that Trump is Hitler because he sorta, kinda used a phrase vaguely like Hitler once did in one of his speeches.  On September 30, 1942, shortly after the death camps began gassing Jews, Hitler declared, In Germany too the Jews once laughed at my prophecies. I dont know whether they are still laughing, or whether they have already lost the inclination to laugh, but I can assure you that everywhere they will stop laughing. With these prophecies I shall prove to be right.  On June 1, 2017, Donald Trump announced that he was pulling America out of the Paris climate accord. At what point does America get demeaned? At what point do they start laughing at us as a country? We want fair treatment for its citizens and we want fair treatment for our taxpayers. We dont want other leaders and other countries laughing at us anymore, and they wont be. They wont be.  See the similarity? Me neither. Presumably thats why author Sasha Abramsky has to editorialize desperately: Its not a direct quote from Hitler, but its perilously close.  But I forget. When youre a liberal, everyone who disagrees with you is Hitler. So I suppose to   this article is only stating the obvious. Even better though, I think, is the announcement by the United Nations that it intends to reject Trumps offer to renegotiate Paris. Here is the Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) spelling it out: #ParisAgreement, a historic treaty signed by 194  ratified by 147 countries, cannot be renegotiated based on the request of a single Party. https:  .      Patricia Espinosa C. (@PEspinosaC) June 2, 2017,  Why is this so funny? Well its a bit like the Camp Commandant at Colditz Castle announcing sternly to the prisoners who have daringly escaped that under no circumstances will they ever be allowed inside the wire and back to their lumpy beds and freezing cells. President Trump has just made what successful escaping prisoners in World War II used to call a Home Run. I doubt he has many regrets about the camp guards he has left behind."

"Obama Warns AgainstIncome Inequality While Delivering $7,700-a-Minute Speech",Breitbart,Penny Starr,6/7/2017,"Former President Barack Obama spoke to the Chamber of Commerce in Montreal on Tuesday, warning against income inequality and the concentration of wealth   remarks from a man who reportedly commanded $400, 000 a speech, or $   at that rate, for his Canadian speech.[  Obama said the world must do more to combat income inequality, noting that the concentration of wealth fans fears that governments exist solely to benefit the powerful, NBC reported. Thats a recipe for more cynicism and more polarization, less trust in our institutions and less trust in each other, Obama said. And its part of what leads people to turn to populist alternatives that may not actually deliver, Obama said in a thinly disguised jab at President Donald Trump without naming his successor specifically. According to the Toronto Star, not everyone could afford to see the man calling for the end of income inequality. A   hall laid out for a rock star, a   stroll for giddy VIPs and video screens for the rest of the roughly 6, 000 who were neither sufficiently wealthy nor connected to get a   seat, the Star reported. This was the scene here at a   appearance nine months in the making: Barack Obamas first   address on Canadian soil   one of the few appearances hes made anywhere since handing power to U. S. President Donald Trump in January, the Star reported. Hotly contested, planned and negotiated until the final days and beamed across North America, it was a strategic investment that may have topped half a million dollars and was meant to put on the map a city in the throes of its 375th anniversary celebrations, the Star reported.

All were seated at the table of honour, surrounded captains of Quebecs business world, sipping wine at corporate tables, the Star reported. The more reasonably priced $375 seats started at a distance where Obama was just a   spec on a faraway stage.  Michel Leblanc, president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, refused to say how much they paid for Obamas visit or what other conditions might have led to their winning bid, according to the Star. Obama has reportedly demanded a $400, 000 (U. S.) speaking fee for at least two other speeches, the Star wrote. One Canadian source, who was unaware of the payment details, said such a price tag   which works out in Canadian dollars to roughly $7, 700 for every minute Obama spent on the Montreal stage   would not be a great surprise, the outlet continued. Meanwhile, NBCs report reveals Obama is now striving to be an international community organizer. Obama said that in times of economic uncertainty it can be tempting to turn to isolationism and the politics of  .  and said World War I and World War II were the result, NBC reported. He said the U. S. and other nations showed there was a better way in creating an international order that was based not just on   but also on principles."
Full Text: James Comeys Prepared Remarks for His Congressional Testimony - Breitbart,Breitbart,Breitbart News,6/7/2017,"Former FBI Director James Comey is set to testify before the U. S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Thursday regarding his firing by President Donald Trump and the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. [The committee has released the full text of Comeys prepared remarks. Read them below:  Chairman Burr, Ranking Member Warner, Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to appear before you today. I was asked to testify today to describe for you my interactions with   and President Trump on subjects that I understand are of interest to you. I have not included every detail from my conversations with the President, but, to the best of my recollection, I have tried to include information that may be relevant to the Committee. January 6 Briefing, I first met    Trump on Friday, January 6 in a conference room at Trump Tower in New York. I was there with other Intelligence Community (IC) leaders to brief him and his new national security team on the findings of an IC assessment concerning Russian efforts to interfere in the election. At the conclusion of that briefing, I remained alone with the President Elect to brief him on some personally sensitive aspects of the information assembled during the assessment. The IC leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming President to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified. Among those reasons were: (1) we knew the media was about to publicly report the material and we believed the IC should not keep knowledge of the material and its imminent release from the   and (2) to the extent there was some effort to compromise an incoming President, we could blunt any such effort with a defensive briefing. The Director of National Intelligence asked that I personally do this portion of the briefing because I was staying in my position and because the material implicated the FBIs   responsibilities. We also agreed I would do it alone to minimize potential embarrassment to the  . Although we agreed it made sense for me to do the briefing, the FBIs leadership and I were concerned that the briefing might create a situation where a new President came into office uncertain about whether the FBI was conducting a   investigation of his personal conduct. It is important to understand that FBI   investigations are different than the   known criminal investigative work. The Bureaus goal in a   investigation is to understand the technical and human methods that hostile foreign powers are using to influence the United States or to steal our secrets. The FBI uses that understanding to disrupt those efforts. Sometimes disruption takes the form of alerting a person who is targeted for recruitment or influence by the foreign power. Sometimes it involves hardening a computer system that is being attacked. Sometimes it involves turning the recruited person into a   or publicly calling out the behavior with sanctions or expulsions of   intelligence officers. On occasion, criminal prosecution is used to disrupt intelligence activities. Because the nature of the hostile foreign nation is well known, counterintelligence investigations tend to be centered on individuals the FBI suspects to be witting or unwitting agents of that foreign power. When the FBI develops reason to believe an American has been targeted for recruitment by a foreign power or is covertly acting as an agent of the foreign power, the FBI will open an investigation on that American and use legal authorities to try to learn more about the nature of any relationship with the foreign power so it can be disrupted. In that context, prior to the January 6 meeting, I discussed with the FBIs leadership team whether I should be prepared to assure   Trump that we were not investigating him personally. That was true we did not have an open   case on him. We agreed I should do so if circumstances warranted. During our    meeting at Trump Tower, based on   Trumps reaction to the briefing and without him directly asking the question, I offered that assurance. I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the   in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after    conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)     once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine    conversations with President Trump in four months     three in person and six on the phone. January 27 Dinner, The President and I had dinner on Friday, January 27 at 6:30 pm in the Green Room at the White House. He had called me at lunchtime that day and invited me to dinner that night, saying he was going to invite my whole family, but decided to have just me this time, with the whole family coming the next time. It was unclear from the conversation who else would be at the dinner, although I assumed there would be others. It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. The President began by asking me whether I wanted to stay on as FBI Director, which I found strange because he had already told me twice in earlier conversations that he hoped I would stay, and I had assured him that I intended to. He said that lots of people wanted my job and, given the abuse I had taken during the previous year, he would understand if I wanted to walk away. My instincts told me that the    setting, and the pretense that this was our first discussion about my position, meant the dinner was, at least in part, an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. That concerned me greatly, given the FBIs traditionally independent status in the executive branch. I replied that I loved my work and intended to stay and serve out my   term as Director. And then, because the   made me uneasy, I added that I was not reliable in the way politicians use that word, but he could always count on me to tell him the truth. I added that I was not on anybodys side politically and could not be counted on in the traditional political sense, a stance I said was in his best interest as the President. A few moments later, the President said, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty.  I didnt move, speak, or change my facial expression in any way during the awkward silence that followed. We simply looked at each other in silence. The conversation then moved on, but he returned to the subject near the end of our dinner. At one point, I explained why it was so important that the FBI and the Department of Justice be independent of the White House. I said it was a paradox: Throughout history, some Presidents have decided that because problems come from Justice, they should try to hold the Department close. But blurring those boundaries ultimately makes the problems worse by undermining public trust in the institutions and their work. Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, I need loyalty.  I replied, You will always get honesty from me.  He paused and then said, Thats what I want, honest loyalty.  I paused, and then said, You will get that from me.  As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase honest loyalty differently, but I decided it wouldnt be productive to push it further. The term     honest loyalty     had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect. During the dinner, the President returned to the salacious material I had briefed him about on January 6, and, as he had done previously, expressed his disgust for the allegations and strongly denied them. He said he was considering ordering me to investigate the alleged incident to prove it didnt happen. I replied that he should give that careful thought because it might create a narrative that we were investigating him personally, which we werent, and because it was very difficult to prove a negative. He said he would think about it and asked me to think about it. As was my practice for conversations with President Trump, I wrote a detailed memo about the dinner immediately afterwards and shared it with the senior leadership team of the FBI. February 14 Oval Office Meeting, On February 14, I went to the Oval Office for a scheduled counterterrorism briefing of the President. He sat behind the desk and a group of us sat in a   of about six chairs facing him on the other side of the desk. The Vice President, Deputy Director of the CIA, Director of the National CounterTerrorism Center, Secretary of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, and I were in the   of chairs. I was directly facing the President, sitting between the Deputy CIA Director and the Director of NCTC. There were quite a few others in the room, sitting behind us on couches and chairs. The President signaled the end of the briefing by thanking the group and telling them all that he wanted to speak to me alone. I stayed in my chair. As the participants started to leave the Oval Office, the Attorney General lingered by my chair, but the President thanked him and said he wanted to speak only with me. The last person to leave was Jared Kushner, who also stood by my chair and exchanged pleasantries with me. The President then excused him, saying he wanted to speak with me. When the door by the grandfather clock closed, and we were alone, the President began by saying, I want to talk about Mike Flynn.  Flynn had resigned the previous day. The President began by saying Flynn hadnt done anything wrong in speaking with the Russians, but he had to let him go because he had misled the Vice President. He added that he had other concerns about Flynn, which he did not then specify. The President then made a long series of comments about the problem with leaks of classified information     a concern I shared and still share. After he had spoken for a few minutes about leaks, Reince Priebus leaned in through the door by the grandfather clock and I could see a group of people waiting behind him. The President waved at him to close the door, saying he would be done shortly. The door closed. The President then returned to the topic of Mike Flynn, saying, He is a good guy and has been through a lot.  He repeated that Flynn hadnt done anything wrong on his calls with the Russians, but had misled the Vice President. He then said, I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go.  I replied only that he is a good guy.  (In fact, I had a positive experience dealing with Mike Flynn when he was a colleague as Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency at the beginning of my term at FBI.) I did not say I would let this go.  The President returned briefly to the problem of leaks. I then got up and left out the door by the grandfather clock, making my way through the large group of people waiting there, including Mr. Priebus and the Vice President. I immediately prepared an unclassified memo of the conversation about Flynn and discussed the matter with FBI senior leadership. I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. I did not understand the President to be talking about the broader investigation into Russia or possible links to his campaign. I could be wrong, but I took him to be focusing on what had just happened with Flynns departure and the controversy around his account of his phone calls. Regardless, it was very concerning, given the FBIs role as an independent investigative agency. The FBI leadership team agreed with me that it was important not to infect the investigative team with the Presidents request, which we did not intend to abide. We also concluded that, given that it was a    conversation, there was nothing available to corroborate my account. We concluded it made little sense to report it to Attorney General Sessions, who we expected would likely recuse himself from involvement in   investigations. (He did so two weeks later.) The Deputy Attorney Generals role was then filled in an acting capacity by a United States Attorney, who would also not be long in the role. After discussing the matter, we decided to keep it very closely held, resolving to figure out what to do with it down the road as our investigation progressed. The investigation moved ahead at full speed, with none of the investigative team members     or the Department of Justice lawyers supporting them     aware of the Presidents request. Shortly afterwards, I spoke with Attorney General Sessions in person to pass along the Presidents concerns about leaks. I took the opportunity to implore the Attorney General to prevent any future direct communication between the President and me. I told the AG that what had just happened     him being asked to leave while the FBI Director, who reports to the AG, remained behind     was inappropriate and should never happen. He did not reply. For the reasons discussed above, I did not mention that the President broached the FBIs potential investigation of General Flynn. March 30 Phone Call, On the morning of March 30, the President called me at the FBI. He described the Russia investigation as a cloud that was impairing his ability to act on behalf of the country. He said he had nothing to do with Russia, had not been involved with hookers in Russia, and had always assumed he was being recorded when in Russia. He asked what we could do to lift the cloud.  I responded that we were investigating the matter as quickly as we could, and that there would be great benefit, if we didnt find anything, to our having done the work well. He agreed, but then   the problems this was causing him. Then the President asked why there had been a congressional hearing about Russia the previous week     at which I had, as the Department of Justice directed, confirmed the investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign. I explained the demands from the leadership of both parties in Congress for more information, and that Senator Grassley had even held up the confirmation of the Deputy Attorney General until we briefed him in detail on the investigation. I explained that we had briefed the leadership of Congress on exactly which individuals we were investigating and that we had told those Congressional leaders that we were not personally investigating President Trump. I reminded him I had previously told him that. He repeatedly told me, We need to get that fact out.  (I did not tell the President that the FBI and the Department of Justice had been reluctant to make public statements that we did not have an open case on President Trump for a number of reasons, most importantly because it would create a duty to correct, should that change.) The President went on to say that if there were some satellite associates of his who did something wrong, it would be good to find that out, but that he hadnt done anything wrong and hoped I would find a way to get it out that we werent investigating him. In an abrupt shift, he turned the conversation to FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, saying he hadnt brought up the McCabe thing because I had said McCabe was honorable, although McAuliffe was close to the Clintons and had given him (I think he meant Deputy Director McCabes wife) campaign money. Although I didnt understand why the President was bringing this up, I repeated that Mr. McCabe was an honorable person. He finished by stressing the cloud that was interfering with his ability to make deals for the country and said he hoped I could find a way to get out that he wasnt being investigated. I told him I would see what we could do, and that we would do our investigative work well and as quickly as we could. Immediately after that conversation, I called Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente (AG Sessions had by then recused himself on all   matters) to report the substance of the call from the President, and said I would await his guidance. I did not hear back from him before the President called me again two weeks later. April 11 Phone Call, On the morning of April 11, the President called me and asked what I had done about his request that I get out that he is not personally under investigation. I replied that I had passed his request to the Acting Deputy Attorney General, but I had not heard back. He replied that the cloud was getting in the way of his ability to do his job. He said that perhaps he would have his people reach out to the Acting Deputy Attorney General. I said that was the way his request should be handled. I said the White House Counsel should contact the leadership of DOJ to make the request, which was the traditional channel. He said he would do that and added, Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know.  I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing.  I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended. That was the last time I spoke with President Trump."
Mayor Of First Ladys European Hometown: Melania Put Us On The World Map,Breitbart,John Binder,6/7/2017,"First Lady Melania Trumps small hometown in central Slovenia is booming with business thanks to her ascendance to power and fame in the United States, according to the towns mayor. [In Sevnica, Slovenia, Melania Trump was born Melanija Knavs before she came to the U. S. eventually marrying future U. S. President Donald Trump. Now, Sevnica, with a population of about 5, 000 people, is enjoying its position of having a connection to one of the worlds most famous women.  Melania put us on the world map, Sevnica Mayor Srecko Ocvirk told NPR in an interview. A lot of people are coming from Europe, Japan, China and the U. S., Ocvirk said in the interview. From an anonymous little town, we are now on the world tourist map.  Now, tourists to Sevnica can visit Melanias hometown elementary school and apartment building, and can take a   walking tour of the neighborhood in which she grew up, for just $90. The    tour is just one of many that tourists can choose from in the tiny town. Also, the Kruhek bakery in Sevnica now offers a   apple pie, known officially as the First Lady Apple Pie.  The bakery also offers a   sweet cake. We wanted to do something that is a mix of America and Sevnica, Maja Kozole Popadic, whose family owns the bakery, told NPR. Additionally, the Kopitarna shoe store in Sevnica has gotten in on the Melania craze, creating White House slippers that retail for $60 a pair. The designer of the slipper, Maja Stamol, told NPR he has made 300 pairs and is almost sold out at this point. Melania has not gone back to the region in more than a decade, though her parents reportedly still own a home in Sevnica.   John Binder is a reporter for Breitbart News.

DOJ: Drug Overdose Now Leading Cause of Death for Americans Under 50 - Breitbart,Breitbart,Alex Clark,6/7/2017,"Drug overdose is now the leading cause of death for Americans under the age of 50, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said Tuesday morning. Rosenstein, along with acting head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Chuck Rosenberg, and other prominent officials in law enforcement addressed the media at the DEAs headquarters in Arlington, VA to discuss the ongoing response to the nations staggering opioid epidemic. [Were not talking about a slight increase. Theres a horrifying surge of drug overdoses in the United States of America. Some people say we should be more permissive, more tolerant, more understanding about drug use. I say we should be more honest and forthcoming with the American people on the clear and present danger that we know face, opened Rosenstein.  Fentanyl is especially dangerous. It is 40 to 50 times more deadly than heroin. Just two milligrams, a few grains of salt, an amount you could fit on the tip of your finger, can be lethal. Fentanyl exposure can injure or kill innocent law enforcement officers and first responders. Inhaling a few airborne particles can have dramatic effects, he continued.  Above: Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein speaks with law enforcement at the DEA HQ in Arlington, Virginia, Rosenstein, Rosenberg, and their colleagues used the event to roll out new precautions for first responders in dealing with fentanyl. Such measures predominately featured hazmat suits as a means of avoiding airborne inhalation. [Fentanyl]s everywhere and its killing people, Rosenberg solemnly remarked. Despite such a bleak update, Rosenberg claimed reasons for careful optimism in the midst of this epidemic. He has spoken extensively with his Chinese counterparts in law enforcement, given that China is the major source of Fentanyl that enters America. According to Rosenberg, the Chinese government banned 116 synthetic opioids for export and 4 more after his trip to China this March. Additional synthetics are scheduled to be banned as well. I do not want to understate such gains, nor do I want to overstate them, he cautioned. More progress in international cooperation, he said, still has to be made in cutting off fentanyl shipments from China. Rosenberg and other law enforcement officials such as Jonathan Thompson of the National Sheriffs Association assessed the difficulty associated with training first responders in such new duties and admitted that such efforts would strain already stretched resources in fighting what is an overwhelming epidemic.  Above: DEA Head Chuck Rosenberg discusses first responders new preventative measures for fentanyl exposure, Rosenbergs daunting assessment of fentanyl put in perspective the existential danger of the ongoing opioid crisis that, according to Rosenstein, has contributed to the largest yearly increase in overdose deaths on record in America. Rosenberg pointed out that such statistics tend to wash over you.  To grasp the enormity of the epidemic he claimed that if three   as deadly as the Pulse Nightclub Attack occurred three times every day for 365 days, then the death toll would roughly reach that of drug overdoses in 2015.

Texas Dem Arrested for Alleged DWI after Safe Driving Seminar,Breitbart,Merrill Hope,6/7/2017,"Dallas police arrested the Texas House Democrat voted Freshman of the Year late Tuesday night for driving while intoxicated. [Officers, responding to message that a vehicle hit a tree, later learned that the allegedly drunk driver was state Representative Victoria Neave ( ).  Reportedly, she did not cooperate with law enforcement who arrived on scene. The arrest warrant described Neave, 36, as having a strong odor of alcohol, unsteady, and with bloodshot eyes and slurred speech, WFAA reported. Officers also documented the state lawmakers behavior as uncooperative, refusing to perform field sobriety tests, and give breath or blood samples. According to police records, Neave repeatedly told officers in slurred speech: I love you and I will fight for you and Im invoking my Fifth Amendment rights.  Officers booked her into the Dallas County Jail at 3:30 a. m. (CDT) on Wednesday where she remained, waiting to see a magistrate. However, on Wednesday, shortly before 2 p. m. Neave took to social media with a public Facebook apology. She stated: Last night, I disappointed my family, my constituents, and my supporters. I disappointed myself. Im deeply sorry. Im so grateful that no one was hurt. I will accept full responsibility for my actions and I will work to make this right.  Ironically, Neave participated in a   event promoting safe driving on Sunday, June 4. The often outspoken freshman representative has maintained a highly visible profile during the states 2017 legislative session. In April, she marched in Dallas against Texas sanctuary city legislation, Senate Bill 4, which Governor Abbott since signed into law. Breitbart Texas reported she tweeted: Eleven years ago, I marched   family. This time, I march as a State Representative fighting   legislation at #txlege.  A few weeks later, she led a hunger strike to oppose SB 4, asking other Democrat lawmakers and open border advocates to join her, as was reported by Breitbart Texas. She was also the organizer of the Dallas Womens March and Texas House Democratic Caucus recently named her Freshman of the Year.  On Wednesday morning, Dallas County Democratic Party Chair Carol Donovan responded to the news of Neaves arrest by issuing a statement: We understand, and are thankful, that no other person was involved or injured in the accident. Nevertheless, we look forward to speaking with her regarding the facts of her case and to insure she is alright. We wish her the very best and pray for her swift recovery so that she can resume her strong representation of the citizens of House District 107. Neaves district encompasses East Dallas, Mesquite, and Garland. By trade, she is a lawyer with a practice in Dallas. Follow Merrill Hope, a member of the original Breitbart Texas team, on Twitter."
Allah Will Get You: London Nursery Worker Attacked With Blade,Breitbart,Liam Deacon,6/7/2017,"Counter Terrorism Police have been alerted after three women, alleged shouting Allah will get you and quoting the Quran, stabbed a nursery school worker in North London. [The victim was waiting at a junction in Wanstead at around 9. 30am when she was attacked from behind by the trio, pulled to the ground, and attacked with a blade.

Belts are often cheaply made, using bonded leather that can break down easily under the stress of a waistline. Instead, buy a belt made from   leather, which will last much longer. Similar to a suit, a tuxedo never needs to be bought more than once. Though styles do fluctuate, they never really change that much. Buy one tuxedo, and as long as you dont grow out of it, you can wear it for a very long time. Buying quality costs more, but its often worth. .."
Jeff Sessions reportedly suggested he resign amid growing rift with Trump,Business Insider,Allan Smith,6/7/2017,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently suggested he could   resign amid a souring relationship between himself and   President Donald Trump, sources .     The news outlet reported that the friction between the   president and his attorney general stems from Sessions March   decision to recuse himself from the investigation into Russian   election meddling and all   inquiries.     Multiple sources told ABC that the recusal is one of the top   disappointments of Trumps presidency. ABCs sources said Trump   has remained fixated on it, and two sources said Trump has   lashed out repeatedly at Sessions privately, pointing at his   decision to recuse himself as the reason for the escalation in   the Russia investigation. Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who   last month was appointed special counsel by Deputy Attorney   General Rod Rosenstein, now oversees the investigation.     The tense relationship between the two men runs both ways, ABC   wrote, adding that Sessions sentiment prompted his resignation   offer. Sessions was the first senator to publicly endorse Trump   and has been one of his most loyal backers. Trump rewarded   Sessions after his election with one of the most coveted jobs in   any administration, the opportunity to lead the Justice   Department.     Sarah Isgur Flores, a Justice Department spokesperson, declined   to comment on the ABC story when emailed by Business   Insider.      Earlier Tuesday, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said he   could not answer when asked if Trump still has confidence in   Sessions.     I have not had that discussion with him, Spicer said. He later   added, after being pressed again on the matter: I said I have   not had a discussion with him on the question. I dont, If I   havent had a discussion about a subject, I tend not to speak   about it.     The reportedly deteriorating relationship between Trump and   Sessions  which   said Monday that Trump was placing blame on Sessions for   various problems that faced his administration.     On Monday morning, Trump took aim at the Justice Department on   Twitter for its defense of his controversial travel ban on six   Muslim countries, which is currently blocked by the courts. Trump   seemed to blame the DOJ for the politically correct revised   version of the order, which Trump himself signed, posting that   the Justice Department should have stayed with the original   Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version   they submitted to the Supreme Court.     The Times reported that Trump has intermittently fumed for   months over Sessions recusal from all Russia matters, citing   individuals close to the president. That recusal is connected in   some way to much of the past two months of discomfort and     pain for Trump, the Times wrote.  Attorney General Jeff Sessions recently. .."
The 17 most useful new features coming to your iPhone and iPad this fall,Business Insider,Alex Heath,6/7/2017,"Apples next major software update for the iPhone and iPad, iOS 11, was unveiled on Monday during the companys annual conference for app developers. There are plenty of important changes coming in iOS 11, like . But the most notable new features, such as the ability to send money to a friend with iMessage, will make your iPhone and iPad more useful. Here are the best new features in iOS 11 that you can look forward to when Apple makes the update available for everyone this fall: Apples next major software update for the. .."
"Apple announced the future this week, and you probably didnt even notice",Business Insider,Steve Kovach,6/7/2017,"Apple revealed its   plan for the future this week.     If you dont remember that slide from the hours of presentations   Apple execs made on stage during the companys developer   conference on Monday, youre not alone.      Apple didnt explicitly call it a   plan. And the   company was very subtle about how it showed this roadmap.      But look closely, and its easy to see.     Instead of introducing flashy new products that will change your   life today, this years WWDC conference was all about putting the   pieces in place for what comes next.         A new augmented reality platform, virtual reality development   tools, the HomePod speaker, and improvements to iOS 11 on iPad   may not feel revolutionary or even particularly useful right now,   but they are the building blocks for the technologies Apple is   betting will power our future.     Lets break it down:        Ask most tech companies today what product will replace the   smartphone and the answer will probably revolve around a wearable   device for augmented reality, the tech that overlays digital   images on the real world.     Microsoft has . Google has  and, one day, headgear like Google   Glass. Facebook announced its AR ambitions a few months ago, and   Mark Zuckerberg even said  one day.      Apples approach is different.     There werent any AR goggle demos or TED     prophecies about how a pair of glasses will soon be the only   computer you need. Instead, Apple is starting with something   already very familiar: the iPhone and a new way for developers to   build AR apps for the phone. When iOS 11 becomes available   on tens of millions of Apple devices this fall, Apple will   immediately have the largest AR platform. Even better, itll be   on the devices that people already use, not futuristic   glasses or headsets. Apple will get a major advantage over   its AR competitors with one simple software update.     That  of course, and it certainly   wont deliver the kind of   experience being developed   by companies like Magic Leap.   iPhones will mostly mean   some cool games and entertainment apps at first. Pikachu   will look more realistic in Pokmon GO. Youll be able to build   virtual Lego models on your coffee table. The rainbow puke in   your Snapchat selfies will look even better.     But AR on the iPhone sets Apple up for the long run by   building a base of developers already dedicated to the   platform who want to make stuff for the largest amount   of users they can. If and when Apple decides to take AR to   the next level with a pair of smart glasses or something else,   itll be in a better position than companies trying to win over   developers.        Apple has been  even as the   rest of the tech industry seemed to be . But now the time   feels right for Apple, and its offering a new set of tools in   the the upcoming macOS Sierra software that lets developers   connect VR headsets and create 3D and VR content.     This isnt about attracting gamers and VR enthusiasts to the   Mac. This is about making sure Apples most dedicated class of   users have the tools they need to create the content of the   future. Apple has historically been the platform of choice for   digital artists, filmmakers, and other professionals, and adding   VR development tools will make sure those users have what they   need and dont abandon Apple.        HomePod, the new Amazon Echo competitor, is Apples biggest new   Trojan horse of all.     Even though Apple  and pitched it as a   new kind of home stereo, it undersold the rest of the real   potential. HomePod is also Apple putting Siri in your home   in a new way and making a   play for the concept of   ambient computing, where everything you own is connected and   powered by an underlying artificial intelligence.     HomePod is a way to put Siri everywhere else when youre not   looking at your iPhone, typing on your Mac, listening to your   AirPods, or tracking your workout on your Apple Watch. HomePod is   Apple creeping into the rest of your life under the guise of a   really nice WiFi stereo. Apple may be focusing on music now   with HomePod, but its also sneaking in a lot of Amazon     features like controlling your connected appliances and getting   updates from Siri.     That said, its pretty clear why Apple would want to bury the AI   features of HomePod. Pitching it as a digital assistant instead   of a music player will only open up Apple to more criticism about   how its falling behind in AI compared to Google and Amazon.   Apples Siri is still much less capable as a virtual assistant   than the rival offerings from Amazon and Google, and Apple has a   lot more work to do to catch up. But theres no question   that AI is a big area of investment for Apple, and HomePod will   play an important role in this strategy as Apple makes progress.        The biggest news with iOS 11 wasnt on the iPhone. It was on the   iPad.     Apple has finally started making improvements to the software   that help turn the iPad into the laptop replacement the company   has been . Theres a new file storage system, an   app dock similar to the one on Mac, the ability to drag and drop   content in between apps, and apps that float in separate windows.   The iPad is starting to feel less like a giant iPhone and more   like a touchscreen Mac.     Theres still a lot of work to do. The iPad Pros keyboard isnt   as good as the one on a normal laptop, and its now up to   developers to build compelling apps that take advantage of   all the new iOS 11 features and give people a better reason to   ditch their laptop for an iPad. The new 10.  iPad is a small   move in the right direction since its larger size allows for a     keyboard, but its still not enough.     But Apple is inching closer towards its ultimate goal of creating   a super thin and portable laptop replacement, and iOS 11   feels like huge milestone.      A lot of this stuff may not work out. Were in a period of   relatively flat innovation across most of the tech industry,   where new gizmos only improve incrementally year to year. Its   impossible to tell which wild idea will actually end up taking   off and which will fizzle. (Two years ago everyone thought   smartwatches were going to revolutionize the tech industry, after   all. Now thats barely part of the conversation.)     In some sense, Apples latest batch of WWDC announcements   feels underwhelming, like Apple is dabbling in various areas   rather than making a bold move in any one direction. But the   companys vision for the future is already being etched   into its products. Just look closely, its right in front of   you.  Apple revealed its   plan for the future. .."
Social Justice Warriors Have Become a Trendy Demographic for Advertisers - Breitbart,Breitbart,Lucas Nolan,6/7/2017,"Advertisers have begun appealing to the social justice wing of liberalism in an attempt to increase sales, according to the Guardian. [The Guardian reports that advertisers are using social justice related advertising campaigns to appeal to liberals across America. One ad celebrating   comes from a very unusual source, the car company Kia. In the ad, actress Melissa McCarthy is driving in a Kia car when she gets a call to save the whales,   In an ad for the home rental app Airbnb, a message flashes across the screen reading, We believe no matter who you are, where youre from, who you love, or who you worship, we all belong.  The video was shared across social media with the caption, acceptance starts with all of us.  Acceptance starts with all of us. #weaccept pic. twitter.      Airbnb (@Airbnb) February 6, 2017,  These ads are examples of a growing trend within advertising which seeks to appeal to liberal demographics. The Guardian spoke to urbanist Richard L Florida who thinks that the ads are representative of a divided country with advertisers catering to voting groups often based on location alone. As richer people became more liberal, advertisers began attempting to appeal to those with the largest wallets. Advertisers used to wonder how a spot would play in Peoria, says Florida. Now they wonder how it would play in Brooklyn.  Rob Baiocco, a creative executive at BAM Connection who has produced ads for major brands such as Pringles and Starburst, believes that many of these ads are highly suspect in their aims, often pretending to care about social issues to appeal to liberal millennials without really bothering to research the issue whatsoever. Companies are avidly and aggressively trying to get involved in a socially responsible space, and they are doing it horribly     they are grabbing at straws. They are entering a complex conversation they have no right to be in, yet they are forcing their way in, Baiocco said. These creatives are trying to make their toilet paper save the world.  Sometimes a Pringle is just a Pringle.  stated Baiocco. Sarah   an advertising expert at the University of Southern California, took issue with the faux compassion that many of these ads show. Empowering girls becomes a product unto itself. Thats commodity activism: theres no real connection to structural change, said  . Read the full article in The Guardian here.

Fired TV Reporter: Ive Received Thousands of Sexual and Violent Threats,Breitbart,Katherine Rodriguez,6/7/2017,"A Philadelphia television reporter who lost her job after she was caught screaming expletives at a police officer outside a comedy club said she is now receiving thousands of sexual and violent phone messages and threats. [Colleen Campbell, 28, said she is the one being targeted now after she claimed she was ruined when the video of her   tirade went viral and caused her to lose her job as a reporter at PHL 17.  From the time the video was made public, Ms. Campbell has been the recipient of thousands of lewd and threatening phone calls, texts, messages, and emails ranging from angry, profane, and defamatory insults to deeply disturbing sexual and violent threats, Campbell family spokesman and attorney Wayne Pollock told the New York Post in a statement. Ms. Campbell and her family are still sorting out the events of that night. Their highest priority is the health and   of Ms. Campbell.  Pollock added that Campbell is trying to reach out to the Philadelphia police officer to offer an apology for her behavior. The video showed Campbell verbally lashing out at the officer while the officer just asked her to walk away. Or what? Or what, motherf   ker? Lick my a   hole, Campbell says in the video. How about that? F   king piece of s   t. Thats why nobody likes f   king police        idiots in this f   king town.  Police told Philadelphia magazine that Campbell faces assault charges for allegedly kicking the unidentified officer as well as the doors and windows of the police cruiser multiple times after her arrest. The assault charges are in addition to the charges of resisting arrest, criminal mischief, and disorderly conduct that she already faces. Campbell originally claimed to have consumed two drinks at the comedy club and believes she was drugged. The Post reports that she later admitted to having five drinks, including two shots she consumed before the show and a few drinks she had while bartending at the Devils Den in South Philadelphia earlier in the evening."
MILO Fan Sues UC Berkeley for $23 Million over Abuse Against Conservatives on Campus - Breitbart,Breitbart,Charlie Nash,6/7/2017,"A fan of former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos is suing UC Berkeley for $23 million, claiming routine abuse against conservative students on campus. [The fan of Milo, whose book Dangerous reached #1 on Amazons best sellers list within a day of being made available to   this week, claims that her First Amendment rights were infringed after she was forced to evacuate Milos speech   in February when a   protest turned into a violent riot.  The suit, filed in federal court in California on Monday alleges that the defendants have subjected UC Berkeley students and invitees who do not subscribe to the radical, left wing philosophies sanctioned by Defendants to severe violence and bodily harm for merely expressing a differing viewpoint, in clear contravention of their rights under the First Amendment to the U. S. Constitution, reported SF Gate on Tuesday. In addition to the UC Berkeley Regents, the suits many defendants include UC president Janet Napolitano, the UC Berkeley police department, the Berkeley police department, frequent conservative target George Soros and California representative Nancy Pelosi.  In the lawsuit, the fan claims that The University of California Berkeley (UC Berkeley)        has acted to unconstitutionally curtail the First Amendment rights of its students and invitees thereof.  Several people, including Plaintiff Robles, were intentionally and violently attacked by both masked and unmasked assailants and the UC Berkeley campus incurred over $100, 000 worth of damage, the suit continues. Plaintiff Robles was attacked with extremely painful pepper spray and bear mace by masked assailants amongst the protestors because she chose to exercise her right to freedom of speech and show support for the planned speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos.  In addition, the lawsuit also claims no campus police were around to defend students, attendees, and the speaker when violence from protesters started to erupt. Nearly 100 campus police and SWAT members waited in the Student Union building, within eyesight of the violence happening outside, watching the protestors become more belligerent and dangerous, the suit claims, adding that the defendants should have been fully prepared for violence from   protesters.   from   groups started several fires, smashed windows and ATMs, looted downtown stores, attacked cars, and assaulted dozens of Milo fans, male and female, who they falsely accused of being Nazis during the riot on February 1. The San Francisco Chronicle reported that rioters caused around $100, 000 in damages at UC Berkeley, while the damage to downtown Berkeley was reported to be around $400, 000 to $500, 000. An organizer for the   group BAMN called the violent Berkeley riot against Milo stunningly successful, before warning that MILO could expect the same response should he return to the city. Milo is currently planning a free speech week at UC Berkeley, where he will return with other speakers. Charlie Nash is a reporter for Breitbart Tech.

Katie Couric Beats Defamation Lawsuit over Edited Gun Control Documentary,Breitbart,AWR Hawkins,6/7/2017,"A district judge has dismissed a defamation lawsuit brought against Katie Couric over what the Yahoo News anchor herself described as misleading edits in her 2016 gun control documentary, Under the Gun. [The $12 million defamation suit was filed the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL) in September 2016, as they claimed that responses from their members were edited in a way that made them appear stumped by Courics questions on gun laws and regulations. The suit was dismissed by District Judge John Gibney Jr. Wednesday.  On May 25, 2016, Breibart News reported that Couric was busted for manipulating the responses of   advocates in Under the Gun through selective editing. Footage from the documentary appears to show an   pause between the time Couric asked a question concerning gun control and the time in which VCDL members answered: But the Washington Free Beacon obtained the actual audio of the VCDL members interacting with Couric, and that audio makes clear they responded to Courics question immediately. The pause had apparently been inserted to make it appear as if the   advocates featured in the film were stumped by Courics question.  Couric released an statement of apology in light of the compelling evidence that a pause had been inserted between her question and the VCDL members responses. She wrote: As executive producer of Under the Gun, a documentary film that explores the epidemic of gun violence, I take responsibility for a decision that misrepresented an exchange I had with members of the Virginia Citizens Defense League (VCDL). My question to the VCDL regarding the ability of convicted felons and those on the terror watch list to legally obtain a gun, was followed by an extended pause, making the participants appear to be speechless. She went on to admit that the   pause was a misleading edit that [did] not accurately represent the response of VCDL members. Despite Courics admission, Judge Gibney dismissed the defamation suit against her last week. He ruled that the depiction of VCDL members did not meet the threshold of making them appear unfit as a gun rights advocacy organization.  On June 6, the VCDL announced that it would appeal Gibneys decision. VCDL president Philip Van Cleave posted a statement to Facebook: The VCDL Board of Directors, after careful consideration, has decided that the recent ruling dismissing the VCDL case against Katie Couric, et al, CANNOT STAND! The lawsuit has far reaching implications for all Americans. If the media can be allowed to change a persons words to suit the medias own needs or beliefs, then a grievous blow will have been struck against the very core of the freedom that the United States stands for! NO! We are going to fight this because too much is at stake. AWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of Bullets with AWR Hawkins, a Breitbart News podcast.

"Political Hospice Is Way Forward For White Working Class, Says WashPo Editor - Breitbart",Breitbart,Neil Munro,6/7/2017,"A   advocate says the   mostly white   communities in the United States must be wheeled into political hospice care, and a Washington Post columnist commended his solution as a way forward. [Economic dislocation and demographic changes are fueling discomfort and desperation among white   voters, wrote WashPo columnist and editorial board member Jonathan Capehart, continuing:  While [university professor and author] Justin Gest says that both Republicans and Democrats have exploited these voters, he sees a way forward. The only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care, [Gest] said. These are communities that are on the paths to death. And the question is: How can we make that as comfortable as possible? Capehart declined to answer questions from Breitbart about his statement that hospice care for mostly white   communities is a way forward for the nation. He declined to suggest alternative policies or to suggest which of the progressives political goals could be traded to win support for white   voters in 2020. The offer of political elimination to   communities has prompted anger even from some   writers, such as Martin Longman at The Washington Monthly. Im not saying the whole Democratic Party feels this way, but the default position among a lot of progressives since the election has been that to even talk about these folks is to pander to their racism and dilute the partys commitment to civil rights, womens rights, gay rights, and the environment. If we want to draw up our battle lines like that, then they sure as s*** are going to take the hint       I dont recognize a [political] left that has no better solution for struggling people than to make their inevitable deaths more comfortable. Thats not just a political loser. Its an indefensible position to take as human beings. Every single community needs a left that will represent them and that doesnt mean it will tolerate them or give them just enough to ease the worst of their pain. Gest responded to Breitbarts questions by doubling down, saying immigrants can replace American consumers, workers, and children, and also that expert advice will soothe American communities during their   exit: Declining towns need immigrants to reinvigorate their markets, take on unwanted labor positions, and add youth to aging demographies. Once these communities understood the benefits immigrants bring and were consulted about the terms of their integration, they would feel more comfortable with their arrival. Breitbart asked if Americans communities can be strengthened by   curbs on immigration or trade, but Gest, a strong advocate for globalism, offered only a series of additional government programs to offset the current   policies of cheap labor and cheap imports. Public policy can help ease the pressure on outmoded   communities and facilitate their integration into the modern economy       States can incentivize apprenticeships and job training by the private sector like they do in Montana. They can provide universal health care like they do in Vermont. Other ideas have yet to be pursued: What if welfare benefits increased when recipients were enrolled in university programs or trade schools, so that we subsidize   and innovation? What if the quality of school districts werent correlated with the income of their neighborhoods, entrenching people into intergenerational poverty? What if minimum wage laws, workplace protections, and family leave policies allowed people to live on the jobs that already exist in the United States today? These ideas dont require a revolution they require courage and political will       Higher wages can be mandated by policy, and so can more accessible, high quality education. Policy can therefore reduce wage competition at the bottom and help level the playing field for poorer Americans. Gest, an assistant professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University, sharply opposed cuts to current high level of immigration, which now imports one immigrant for every four Americans who turn 18. Gest also argued that immigrants are more inventive and hardworking than Americans and are also more useful to the prosperous   saying: Immigration is one of the principal engines of [economic] growth in the United States because immigrants disproportionately start new businesses (which hire people) and innovate (by filing patents). They also often take unwanted jobs in meatpacking, cleaning, and agriculture. Would it have been better if Albert Einstein stayed in Germany? What if Jerry Yangs family stayed in Taiwan?        [also] reducing immigration would actually hurt the middle class. Gest made his hospice comments when Capehart invited him to talk via his podcast about his book on white   communities, titled The New Minority: White Working Class Politics in an Age of Immigration and Inequality.  Their conversation was revealing because Gest repeatedly admitted that the fight over   communities is also a political fight over who gets higher social status. Democrats, he argued, want to grant higher status to their diverse coalition of progressives and various minorities, and are willing to reduce the social status of the white  . Many   whites supported former President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but pulled the lever for Donald Trump in 2016 because Trumps support for   communities was a huge contrast to the disdain from Democrats. It has become okay [among Democrats] to become classist against poor white people and the [white voters] see it, said Gest. The partys coalition includes environmentalists, lawyers, Latinos, hippies, and   drivers, Gest said, adding there are many people in there who like the privileged status that the Democratic Party gives to certain ethnic groups.  For the party to welcome the white working class, he added, it would be cheapening the privileges given to others.  Capehart did not disagree and did not counter Gests comments during the podcast interview.  Capehart did push the claim that white   support for Trump is based on mere nostalgia for prior decades, not on a rational hope that Trumps   policies are better than the Democrats   immigration policies, and might even revive struggling American communities in Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania and other states.  Gest did not suggest any political fixes for   immigration or global trade, saying: For many white working class people, and this is going to be controversial, for many white working class people, not all of them but many, you have a community of people who are advanced in age, whose skill set is for a different economy, who are living in communities that are losing population, losing resources, and so in many ways, the only way of addressing their plight is a form of political hospice care. These are communities that are on the paths to death, and the question is how can we make that as comfortable as possible        Gest inadvertently admitted that the targets of his pity, white   communities, actually have a broader,   view of their economic circumstances, saying: How can we truly level the playing field? And what is so remarkable Jonathan, is that that is the language many of my white working class respondents used. It is the language that weve heard the civil rights movement use     Leveling the playing field, Finding equality. That is where Gest defaulted to the palliative policy of giving more taxpayer funds to his peers in the   education industry: How can we make an America that has greater mobility        independent of your race, independent of your ethnicity. How can we create avenues for people who start off in these communities in hospice care to live vibrant and dynamic lives of possibility, and I think that so much actually returns to education        education is that avenue to mobility, intergenerational mobility. It allows a steel town to raise children who are not necessarily predestined for manufacturing        our system of education is not allowing us to create a break, an intervention, where we actually prevent these communities destined for death, to be revived. Education cant be the only answer for Americans if the U. S. labor market is also being flooded with cheap foreign workers, said a highly skilled worker contacted by Breitbart. I know you dont know me from a can of paint, but I had to throw in my 2 cents in your article about the WashPo editor, said the woman, who tunes and operates   machine tools in Cincinnati, Ohio. She continued: I work in manufacturing. I have a high school diploma and a   associate degree from Wyotech that currently has as much worth to me as toilet paper (and its just as disposable). I am a [Computer Numeric Control] Machinist. I set up, tool, program, and operate CNC mills and lathes to make precision parts out of Teflon (polytetrafluoroethylene, that nonstick stuff on your frying pan) and can hold tolerances to +   0. 0002. So Im wondering, since I am working in a field of a bygone economic era, how dumb do they think I really am that I need more education? What is more education going to do for me? So I can sit around and be a great   thinker as a white (non) working class individual? What is the threshold of intellectual satiation? How many degrees do we need to be indebted to the federal government before they deem the white working middle class smart enough to associate with people like THAT? I have a hard time understanding how someone like Gest or Capehart can look down their noses at someone like me because I dont share their desire for overpriced toilet paper. Could either of them program a machine to cut an arc into a piece of material? No, but I can. Could either of them change their oil, replace their brakes, or change their front differential fluid? (Id be surprised if they knew where the dipstick is to even check it.) No, but I can. Im a    white working class woman that could outsmart them on a common sense basis and on a highly technical basis, and somehow I am the one that needs more education? People like that think that working class white voters is a descriptor of who we are as a socioeconomic group, with a dash of race and political functionality. Working class (white) voters are machinists, assemblers, machine operators, mechanics, nurses aides, waitresses, small retail store managers, bus drivers, taxi drivers, truck drivers, and all the jobs that they wouldnt dare do themselves, being so much smarter than the rest of us (doubtful they know which end of a wrench to use). Being a working class white voter does not make us inferior or intellectually stunted so much that we need to be (re) educated in liberally biased schools of doublespeak and thoughtlessness. All we want to do is work a good job that does present a modest challenge, that does feel rewarding, keeps the lights on and our bellies full and after all of that, we just want to come home, drink some beers, pet the dog and enjoy the sunset in our small suburban slice of heaven. For us, that is what life is all about. We dont care about revolutions, microaggressions, or how many physical and economic descriptors we can apply to a sub group of a sub group of a sub group. People like Gest and Capehart are more important to themselves, like Narcissus was to his reflection eventually, they will drown in their obsession. And when they do, theyre still gonna be at the counter of a Mom and Pop shop asking some white working class voter with grease on his or her face Whats wrong with my Prius?

Oldest Homo sapiens fossils discovered,CNN,Ashley Strickland,6/7/2017,"(CNN) The oldest fossil remains of Homo sapiens, dating back to 300, 000 years, have been found at a site in Jebel Irhoud, Morocco. This is 100, 000 years older than previously discovered fossils of Homo sapiens that have been securely dated. The discovery was presented in a study in the journal Nature on Wednesday.  This marks the first discovery of such fossils in north Africa, and widens the cradle of mankind to encompass all of Africa, the researchers said. Previous finds were in south or east Africa. The fossils, including a partial skull and a lower jaw, belong to five different individuals including three young adults, an adolescent and a child estimated to be 8 years old. Stone tools, animal bones and evidence of fire were also found within the same layer at the site. But what the researchers found to be most remarkable about these fossils is that they capture a moment in time of evolution. The facial features of the skull look like a modern human, but the brain case is very elongated and archaically characteristic of early humans.  There has been increasing evidence that the modern human lineage diverged from Neanderthals and Denisovans 500, 000 years ago, making us close relatives rather than direct descendants. Before this discovery, it was believed that the early modern humans we evolved from were in Africa 200, 000 years ago and looked very similar to modern humans. But what happened in between that time? This is still unknown, although the researchers suggest the possibility that there were multiple groups of hominins, or human ancestors, overlapping and having complex relationships. Because they didnt previously have fossil evidence of Homo sapiens from 300, 000 years ago, this helps to fill a small part of that gap in the fossil record. The fossils provide insight about this evolutionary time for Homo sapiens before the early modern stage 200, 000 years ago.  Our analysis convinced us that this material represents the very root of our species, the oldest Homo sapiens ever found in Africa or elsewhere, said   Hublin, lead study author, paleoanthropologist and professor at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology.  We confirmed that they display this surprising combination of very advanced features and more archaic conditions. It allowed us to envision a more complex picture for the emergence of our species with different parts of the anatomy evolving at different rates, some features being fixed very early in a modern way and others taking a longer time to reach the modern condition.  If we could see these Homo sapiens from 300, 000 years ago walking around today, they would look very similar to us    if they were wearing a hat, Hublin said. Their faces would be short, flat and retracted compared to Neanderthals, and even some of the dental aspects are similar to ours.  But that elongated skull would give them away as being not quite like us. Their brains, and specifically the cerebellum, wasnt shaped like ours. But based on the brain case they discovered, these Homo sapiens did have a larger cerebellum than Neanderthals. The story of our species in the last 300, 000 years is mostly the evolution of our brain and in this time period, a number of mutations occurred affecting brain connectivity, Hublin said. How the fossils were discovered, East Africa has been considered the cradle of life for the origins and evolution of humans, but north Africa has been largely ignored in this aspect. A skull was found in Florisbad, South Africa, in the 1930s and originally dated to 260, 000 years ago, but its fragmentary and the exact date is subject to debate, the researchers said. During the 1960s, mining began on top of a large hill of limestone in Morocco and when the miners hit a pocket of sediment, it partially collapsed to reveal a human skull, bones and stone artifacts. Initial research revealed the artifacts to be 40, 000 years old, although that didnt align with the features of the bones.  In 2004, efforts were made to clean up the site and excavate it in order to figure out its true age. Its been an active site ever since, and there is still more to be discovered, the researchers said. Hublin and Abdelouahed   of the National Institute for Archaeology and Heritage in Rabat, Morocco, found human and animal bones, stone flints and evidence of fire in a preserved layer of the site.  While this isnt the oldest evidence of fire, not many sites can document this back to 300, 000 years ago. And these fires were controlled, being created and used easily. The fire evidence on the animal bones and burnt flints were key.  Through a dating technique called thermoluminescence, which measures how long its been since a material with crystalline minerals was heated or exposed to sunlight, they determined that the site was anywhere between 300, 000 to 350, 000 years old. This included other previous discoveries at the site.  This was a big wow, Hublin said. We realized this site was much older than anyone could imagine. This discovery, combined with a Homo sapien skull found in South Africa, challenges the theory that Homo sapiens were confined to east Africa.  Im not claiming Morocco became the cradle of modern humankind, Hublin said. Rather, we would support the notion that around 300, 000 years ago, very early forms of Homo sapiens were already dispersed all over Africa. This is facilitated by the fact that between 330, 000  to 300, 000 years before present, Africa did not look like it does today and there was no Sahara Desert. There was a lot of connections between other parts of the continent. The Sahara was effectively green at the time, with open grasslands, groupings of trees, rivers and huge lakes and more wet and humid than it is today. This supported animal life like gazelles, zebras, wildebeests, lions and other big cats    all of which were discovered at the site through fossil evidence of animals that these Homo sapiens hunted.  The tools and fire evidence also point to this being a site linked with the Middle Stone Age. A period spanning a million and half years before this involved the use of large, heavy stone tools like hand axes and cleavers.  What distinguished the Middle Stone Age is a shift from large,   stone tools to an emphasis on producing stone flakes that were smaller and lighter, said Shannon McPherron, archaeologist  at Max Planck and one of the study authors. They would transform these flakes into pointed forms that most archeologists think were part of weaponry, increased sufficiency in hunting at a distance, which was more effective and safer for the hunter. During the time these Homo sapiens lived, the site at the collapsed hill was actually a cave that provided shelter. Their findings paint a picture of a hunting encampment where people passing through the landscape would spend the night, take shelter and clean and consume the animals they hunted, McPherron said. There are also no nearby sources for flint, meaning that the Homo sapiens found their high quality raw materials elsewhere. McPherron believes that the flakes indicate that the hunters were sharpening and transforming the flints while they were in the cave.  Whats next, Sequencing of the Neanderthal and Denisovan genomes happened at the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology, but that wont happen with these fossils. Although they tried to extract DNA from them, it wasnt there, Hublin said. Ancient DNA has yet to be recovered from Africa because the fossils are too old and the conditions are too hot.  The researchers hope to return to Jebel Irhoud because there is still more to be excavated. But this discovery creates more questions about how, when and where we evolved.  Evolution was not a sudden shift, but a gradual accretion of features and a series of mutations affecting development, the researchers said. And due to environmental changes, it was happening sometimes in isolated populations other times, exchanges of genes and innovation occurred when populations came together, causing favorable mutations to spread through populations due to positive selection, Hublin believes.  This is the oldest known fossil to date    for now, Hublin said. And the center of origin for us as a species is still unknown. But this discovery widens the cradle of life from East Africa to the whole continent, Hublin said, and suggests that these evolutionary changes were happening across the continent at the same time. Our results challenge the preconceived notion of early modern humans in East Africa in many ways regarding the date of emergence of our species, the geographical conditions of this emergence and the conditions of the evolution of the early forms of Homo sapiens, Hublin said."
House Dem plans to begin impeachment proceedings,CNN,Deirdre Walsh,6/7/2017,"(CNN) The day before former FBI Director James Comey testifies before Congress about his interactions with President Donald Trump regarding his probe of Russias interference in the 2016 campaign, a House Democrat plans to draft articles of impeachment. Texas Rep. Al Green, who was the first House Democrat to call for the Presidents impeachment on the House floor last month, plans to move forward with the next legislative step at a Wednesday news conference on Capitol Hill.  This is obstruction of justice, Green said in a statement Tuesday evening. This will continue to be obstruction of justice regardless of testimony given by Mr. James Comey. This will remain obstruction of justice regardless of the findings of any investigation. Top Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill have specifically urged members to not raise the specter of impeachment, arguing that they need to allow investigations already underway to uncover more details about the president and his teams actions. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, appearing on ABCs The View on Monday, didnt seem to want to utter the I word.   When that word comes up I always say to my colleagues in the Congress, my constituents, and people across the country what I said before: anything you do has to be based on data, evidence, facts, Pelosi said. So you can speculate but its got to be the law and the facts and how they match up. Green did not give Pelosi or others any advance warning that he decided to move ahead with formally introducing the charges in the House, according to two senior House Democratic leadership aides. The Texas Democrat revealed that after his public call for impeachment he received threatening voicemails and messages and told CNN the United States Capitol Police was investigating them.  During his May speech on the House floor, Green noted this is about my position. This is about what I believe. And this is where I stand. I will not be moved. The President must be impeached. He also explained that this was the beginning of the process, For those who do not know, impeachment does not mean that the President would be found guilty. It simply means that the House of Representatives will bring charges against the President. Its similar to an indictment but not quite the same thing."
Democrats furious at evasive answers at hearing,CNN,Jeremy Herb,6/7/2017,"(CNN) Senate Democrats grew increasingly incredulous and visibly frustrated Wednesday with intelligence chiefs testifying at a hearing after Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats and NSA Director Adm. Mike Rogers  repeatedly said they would not discuss their private conversations with President Donald Trump. Coats and Rogers said they did not feel the public setting of the Senate intelligence committees hearing was an appropriate venue to discuss their conversations with Trump, which have reportedly included talk of the FBI investigation into former national security adviser Michael Flynn. But that did not satisfy Democrats, who said there was no reason for them not to divulge the details. Director Coats, youve said as well that it would be inappropriate to answer a simple question about whether the President asked for your assistance in blunting the Russian investigation, said Sen. Martin Heinrich, a New Mexico Democrat. I dont care how you felt. Im not asking whether you felt pressured. Im simply asking did that conversation occur? And once again, senator, I will say that I do believe its inappropriate for me to discuss that in an open session, Coats responded. You can clear an awful lot up by simply saying it never happened, Heinrich later said. I do not share with the general public conversations that I have with the President or many of my colleagues within the administration that I believe should not be shared, Coats repeated. Well, I think your unwillingness to answer a very basic question speaks volumes, Heinrich said. Sen. Angus King of Maine, an Independent who caucuses with Democrats, picked up on Heinrichs questions, demanding a legal justification for why Rogers and Coats were not answering questions. Why are you not answering the questions? Is there an invocation of executive privilege? King asked. Not that Im aware of     because I feel its inappropriate, Rogers said. What you feel isnt relevant, admiral, King shot back. The question is why are you not answering the question? King also went after acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe for invoking the probe of special counsel Robert Mueller, when McCabe said he wouldnt comment on issues in the special counsels lane. I dont understand why the special counsels lane takes precedence over the land of the United States Congress King responded. Interactive: The many paths from Trump to Russia, Virginia Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, tried to push back on that argument, asking whether Mueller has told the witnesses they should not testify. If youve not had questions waived off with Mr. Mueller, I think frankly     and I understand your commitment to the administration     but Sen. King, Sen. Heinrich and my questions deserve answers, and at some point the American public deserve full answers, Warner said. Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein responded that when theres a Justice Department investigation, their default position is not to discuss that publicly. Is that the rule for the President of the United States as well? Warner responded. Because that is what the questions are being asked about, reports that nobody has laid to rest here that the President intervened directly in an ongoing FBI investigation. And weve gotten no answer from any of you. During California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris questioning of Rosenstein, Sens. John McCain and Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr both spoke up to tell her to give the witnesses a chance to answer her questions. The chair is going to exercise the right to allow the witnesses to answer the question, Burr said after cutting off Harris questions. And the committee is on notice to provide the witnesses the courtesy     which has not been extended all the way across     extend the courtesy for questions to get answers. In an interview on CNNs Erin Burnett OutFront following the hearing, Republican Sen. Susan Collins joined her Democratic colleagues taking issue with the lack of answers from Coats and Rogers. There was no assertion of executive privilege, and thus I dont understand why these individuals did not answer all of our questions today, Collins said. If the special counsel Bob Mueller had put constraints on them, or if the President had made the mistake of asserting executive privilege, then I wouldve understood their failure to respond. She said it appeared the intelligence officials were in a limbo where executive privilege had been discussed, but not yet decided on. Wednesdays hearing was not scheduled to discuss the Russia investigation, and both Coats and Rogers indicated they might be more forthcoming in a classified setting with an intelligence panel. There was a classified session for Wednesdays hearing scheduled for the afternoon, but the witnesses were not among those supposed to appear. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia asked if they could show up in the SCIF, the secure facility for classified hearings, but Intelligence Chairman Richard Burr said that was not an option. I think we need you in the SCIF sooner than later, Manchin said."
Welcome to Lebanon ... in the United States,CNN,Jenni Marsh,6/7/2017,"(CNN) On Valentines Day 2005 when Rafic Hariri, the former prime minister of Lebanon, was assassinated by a huge blast of TNT in Beirut, Fadi Boukaram was just moments from the bomb. Having already spent part of his childhood living in a Beirut bomb shelter during the final years of the Lebanese Civil War, Boukaram, now 38, expected the explosion, which also killed 21 others, to spark a second conflict.  He decided it was time to get out. That was February. In March he applied to a state university in San Francisco. In April he was accepted. By August he had left. America was, naturally, a culture shock. I didnt expect to go there and see students burning flags, and drawing swastikas on them, he tells CNN, of the campus protests against the Iraq war.  What did Americans have to be angry about? he thought back then. Pining for home, Boukaram called up the   Google Maps, intending to fondly gaze at road maps of his country from afar. He typed in Lebanon. But he wasnt taken to familiar streets in the Middle East. Lebanon, Oregon, was the first suggestion.   Visiting the Lebanons, Boukaram stayed on Google Maps for hours. I found out that there are tons of them, he says    47 Lebanons in America, by his calculations. Some ghost towns, others cities, most small communities in Middle America.  I just wanted to visit them, he says, find out what they would look like. Back in 2007, money was in short supply for him. But by 2016, after nearly a decade of working in banking and as a tech consultant back in Lebanon, he had enough savings to swap all the boring stuff for a career in photography and take a year off work. In October 2016, just as Trumps campaign trail was sweeping the nation, Boukaram embarked on his own   tour of the Lebanons    his route devised by an algorithm he had programmed to calculate the shortest way round. Lebanon, Oregon, was his first stop. Its pretty much the only Lebanon they have in west America, he says.  Initially, the novelty factor was high, with signs for the road to Damascus, games of Lebanopoly for sale, and priests who wanted to baptize him all providing entertainment.  The first Lebanon was the funniest, because you see signs everywhere saying Lebanon this, Lebanon that. But after the first one, the initial joke    the shock factor    wears off. Why Lebanon? The first thing Boukaram would do in any Lebanon was head to the archive or library and pose a key question: why was this American town or city called Lebanon? The answer, he says, was invariably the same in each place. The word Lebanon is mentioned a lot in the Bible, he explains, and when the Puritans from England landed in America in the 15th and 16th centuries, they were pretty religious people. In the Old Testament, the cedars of Lebanon are a recurring theme    The righteous man will flourish like the palm tree, He will grow like a cedar in Lebanon, for example, is from Psalm 92:12    and, indeed, today the Lebanese national flag bears the cedar tree. So these people, the settlers, would see a forest and think: Those are cedar trees, even though the cedars of Lebanon didnt exist in the New World. But theyd see the cedars and say: Lets call this place Lebanon. For that reason, most of the Lebanons are clustered in the eastern side of the US, where the Puritans first made their homes. By the time they started settling on the West theyd grown less religious and didnt care that much, he only half jokes.  Throughout his journey, Boukaram says he didnt meet a single other Lebanese person, but when he divulged his nationality he was often pleasantly surprised to discover residents of the various Lebanons were aware of his country, and its chequered politics. Theyd say: Oh youre the country without a president! That was shocking. We hadnt had a president at that point in two years. Trump towns, When Boukaram embarked on his   road trip, he    like many others    did not think Trump was going to win the presidency. But as Boukaram tracked east crossing state lines in Oregon, Dakota, Wisconsin, the Republican candidates campaign gained momentum.  It changed the whole course of the trip, he says, referring to the mood not the route. Boukaram is Catholic    Lebanon being a   nation, with considerable Islamic and Christian populations    but he is often presumed Muslim, even in other Middle Eastern countries. In March that year, Trump had famously declared: I think Islam hates us.  Given that climate, what was Boukarams experience encountering Americans in exactly the sort of Middle American towns, some of them entirely white, that were a stronghold for  the property magnate from Queens? The people they were talking about in the news, Clintons basket of deplorables, I was actually interested in talking to. My main purpose wasnt to see if they would discriminate against me. I just wanted to see why (they wanted Trump). The Lebanons that Boukaram visited were often simply too small for locals to discriminate against or avoid residents different to themselves, he says. Everyone had to play nice. As such, Boukaram says his ethnicity virtually never brought him any trouble. Trump supporters were some of the most welcoming people Ive ever seen in my life, he says. In Kentucky, Birmingham Alabama, Kansas, I was bought drinks and dinner. Take Lebanon, South Dakota. Population 47. They have one bar and its owned by the municipality. Every Thursday they go there to play darts, apart from two people who are under 18. There are three barmaids, all in their 70s. As soon as I walked in, one barmaid yelled, Hey hey, stop, this is Fadi! Everybody yelled, Hey! like in an episode of Cheers. Boukaram had been in town four days.   As to why people voted Trump, it was understandable, he says. I went to Nebraska where its all farming communities that are being taken over by big agri companies. Farmers all have second jobs because farming doesnt make money.  Or in Lebanon, Virginia, it was people who used to work in coal, who had been out of a job for years. So even though Trump promised them things hell never be able to do    coal isnt coming back    he was the only one who promised them anything. Islam, he says, was beside the point. Seeking the cedar trees, While his main mission was to capture Americas Lebanons on camera, Boukaram also had another assignment. In 1955, the then Lebanese President Camille Chamoun invited delegates from seven towns called Lebanon    those in Oregon, Nebraska, Indiana, Tennessee, Missouri, New Hampshire, and Ohio    to visit his country for two weeks. As a parting gift, Boukaram says, each visitor was given a cedar tree sapling. Boukaram wanted to locate the trees, and so went through the local newspaper microfiche archives from 1955 to 1958 in each of these towns looking for reports about the gifts, apart from in Nebraska where he met a woman who had been present at the planting ceremony. In the end, he was only able to locate one, in Ohio, where all the saplings had initially been sent.  When you import trees they have to be fumigated and then stay in a nursery for a couple of years, he explains. All but one of the trees died in the nursery in Ohio. The other towns were sent a replacement Virginia juniper tree, also referred to as a red cedar. That single surviving cedar tree still stands today. A symbol of friendship between Lebanon, a country of 4. 3 million people in the Middle East, and the United States, a global powerhouse with a population of 321 million in the West.  For Fadi, though, the two places today have much in common. In rural America, all the villages reminded me so much of the villages we have in Lebanon. In Beirut and other big cities, people are individualist. But the sense of community in the rural Lebanons was the same as the village where I grew up."
"North Korea launches 4 anti-ship missiles, fourth test in a month",CNN,Ben Westcott,6/7/2017,"(CNN) North Korea fired four   missiles into the sea east of the Korean Peninsula Thursday, which the South Korean military said was intended to demonstrate its precise targeting capability. South Koreas joint chiefs said the projectiles, launched near the eastern port city of Wonsan, were believed to be    cruise missiles. We assess that North Korea intended to show off its various missile capabilities, display its precise targeting capability, in the form of armed protests against ships in regard to US Navy carrier strike groups and joint naval drills, Roh   a spokesman for South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staffs told reporters. North Korea has launched 16 missiles in 10 tests so far in 2017, and Thursdays test was the fourth since new South Korean President Moon   took office in May. Analysts say each launch, successful or not, improves missile technology and ultimately provides information that helps bring North Korea closer to its goal of building a missile that could reach the US.  The launch comes one day after Moons government suspended the deployment of a controversial US missile defense system which had strained relations with China and angered North Korea.  The missiles flew about 200 kilometers (124 miles) South Koreas military said in a statement, adding the US military was undertaking a more detailed analysis.  Our military has strengthened surveillance and alertness readiness in cases of additional provocation by North Korean military and is maintaining all readiness posture while we are tracking and monitoring related situation, the statement read. A US defense official confirmed a launch had been detected but told CNN the Pentagon was unlikely  to release a statement as these were not ballistic missiles capable of posing a   threat. North Korea warns Japan, North Korean state media made no mention of the reported launches Thursday, but earlier warned Japan not to gamble on its destiny. If Japan is concerned about its security, it should not act (as) a poodle of the US but withdraw its hostile policy toward the DPRK and remove the US military bases for aggression (sic) from its territory, the statement said. Speaking at a doorstop interview, Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida condemned North Koreas latest missile launch. These provocative actions are intolerable, he said. North Koreas missile program: What you need to know, Analyst: Projectiles could take out carrier, Carl Schuster, a Hawaii Pacific University professor and former director of operations at the US Pacific Commands Joint Intelligence Center, told CNN that this type of missile could, if they got really lucky, immobilize a US aircraft carrier. Two US aircraft carriers, the USS Carl Vinson and the USS Ronald Reagan, have recently departed the Korean Peninsula after conducting exercises there in what a US official described as a message to North Korea. Cruise missiles typically fly in a straight line while a ballistic missile flies miles into the air in an arc to reach its target, he said. Schuster said North Koreans fire missiles usually for three reasons    international posturing, domestic propaganda and military training.  If you really think youre under threat you might want to do a test firing to be ready     so think of it as both a political statement and a training demonstration, he said. Fourth missile test in a month, Thursdays launch is the first since the United Nations Security Council unanimously passed new sanctions last week. The vote came after North Korea fired what it claimed was a new type of ballistic missile from Wonsan that Japanese and South Korean monitors said flew 248 miles (400 kilometers) east of the Korean Peninsula. The resolution slapped additional sanctions on North Korea and condemned the regimes continued proliferation of its nuclear and ballistic program.  The sanctions also extend a travel ban and asset freeze on   North Korean officials and state entities that deal with the program.  China has called on Pyongyang to suspend its testing while calling on the US to stop military exercises on and near the Korean Peninsula, which North Korea sees as a threat to its sovereignty."
Meet NASAs newest Astronaut recruits,CNN,Amanda Jackson,6/7/2017,"(CNN) Many children dream of one day strapping on an astronaut suit, buckling in to a rocket ship and counting down until the spacecraft launches into outer space. For 12 people that dream is becoming a reality.  NASA, along with Vice President Mike Pence, on Wednesday at the Johnson Space Center in Houston announced the newest class of astronaut recruits:  Kayla Barron, 29, Zena Cardman, 29, Raja Chari, 39, Matthew Dominick, 35, Bob Hines, 42, Warren Woody Hoburg, 31, Dr. Jonny Kim, 33, Robb Kulin, 33, Jasmin Moghbeli, 33, Loral OHara, 34, Dr. Francisco Frank Rubio, 41 and Jessica Watkins, 29. These are 12 men and women whose personal excellence and whose personal courage will carry our nation to even greater heights of discovery, said Pence. And who I know will inspire our children and our grandchildren every bit as much as your forebears have done so in this storied American program. The 12 recruits rose to the top of the   18, 300 applications NASA received this year. They wont be launching into space anytime soon, but instead starting their two years of training at Johnson Space Center in August.  Once trained they could be assigned a variety of missions, including: deep space missions, researching at the International Space Station and launching into space on spacecrafts built by commercial companies. Children all across the United States right now dream of being in their shoes someday, said astronaut and Johnson Space Center Director Ellen Ochoa. We here at NASA are excited to welcome them to the team and look forward to working with them to inspire the next generation of explorers."
James Comey just went nuclear on Donald Trump,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/7/2017,"(CNN) James Comeys written testimony regarding his interactions with President Donald Trump regarding the Russia investigation blows a massive hole in the story the president has been telling about the duos interactions. The testimony, which Comey is set to deliver Thursday in one of the most   Congressional hearing in decades, reads like a    dismissal of Trumps version of events    casting Comey as wary from the   of a chief executive who seemed to presume too much and know too little. In the wake of their first interaction, ever, on January 6, Comey decided that it was necessary to have written documentation of any time he spent with Trump.  Read the full testimony here.  Writes Comey: I felt compelled to document my first conversation with the   in a memo. To ensure accuracy, I began to type it on a laptop in an FBI vehicle outside Trump Tower the moment I walked out of the meeting. Creating written records immediately after    conversations with Mr. Trump was my practice from that point forward. This had not been my practice in the past. I spoke alone with President Obama twice in person (and never on the phone)    once in 2015 to discuss law enforcement policy issues and a second time, briefly, for him to say goodbye in late 2016. In neither of those circumstances did I memorialize the discussions. I can recall nine    conversations with President Trump in four months    three in person and six on the phone. Read between the lines there. From the day he met Trump, Comey felt the need to always document everything they talked about    a practice he had never undertaken with President Obama. And, more amazingly, Comey recalls that he had two    conversations with Obama in four years he had nine(!)    conversations with Trump between Jan. 6 and when he was fired on May 9. Nine!  It only gets worse from there for Trump in Comeys opening statement. Comey says that he was surprised to learn that a dinner invitation extended to him by Trump on Jan. 27 was for just the two of them (It turned out to be just the two of us, seated at a small oval table in the center of the Green Room, Comey writes. Two Navy stewards waited on us, only entering the room to serve food and drinks. ) and that the goal of the meeting was an effort to have me ask for my job and create some sort of patronage relationship. Twice in that meeting Trump, recounted Comey, made a direct request for loyalty from the FBI director. I need loyalty, I expect loyalty, Trump told Comey. Later, he returned to the subject. Heres Comeys recollection: He then said, I need loyalty. I replied, You will always get honesty from me. He paused and then said, Thats what I want, honest loyalty. I paused, and then said, You will get that from me.  Comey also confirmed in his written testimony that Trump directly asked him to let go of the investigation into deposed national security adviser Michael Flynn. Quoting Trump, Comey writes of the Feb. 14 meeting in the Oval Office: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go. I mean. Holy crap. Then there is this, from Comeys   report of that meeting: I had understood the President to be requesting that we drop any investigation of Flynn in connection with false statements about his conversations with the Russian ambassador in December. While Comey noted that he did not believe Trump was asking for the entire Russia investigation to disappear, that the sitting FBI director did believe the sitting president was asking to have a federal investigation of any sort dropped is, well, stunning. Related: A timeline of the   relationship, In their final conversation    a phone call from Trump to Comey on April 11    the president again sought to secure Comeys loyalty, according to the former FBI Directors  .    After Comey tells Trump that he should contact the deputy Attorney Generals office in regards to his repeated request to get out the news that he was not a target of the federal investigation, heres how Comey remembers the presidents response: He said he would do that and added, Because I have been very loyal to you, very loyal we had that thing you know. I did not reply or ask him what he meant by that thing. I said only that the way to handle it was to have the White House Counsel call the Acting Deputy Attorney General. He said that was what he would do and the call ended. We had that thing you know. If there is a single sentence that will become the symbol of Comeys testimony    or even of Trumps broader interactions with the FBI director    its that. Trump trying to establish some rapport or, really, some sense of you owe me while Comey stares blankly. The broader picture presented by Comeys testimony is deeply damaging to Trump.   That Trump and Comey had nine    conversations in the space of just over three months    as opposed to the two    chats Comey had with Obama in four years    is hugely telling. And, in those conversations Trump is repeatedly cast as attempting to secure Comeys loyalty    and, at times, suggesting his job depends on it. (FBI directors are appointed for 10 year terms but, as we know, can be fired at any time by a president.) That he asks for Comey to end the probe into Flynn is, at minimum a massive breach of protocol. Trump and his allies will work to dismiss Comeys testimony    and his answers in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee tomorrow    as, at best, a he said, he said situation and, at worst, fake news. Read Comeys testimony yourself. Make your own decision. My read: Trumps   presidency is headed to even rougher waters. And soon."
Heres the single most telling line in James Comeys Trump testimony,CNN,Chris Cillizza,6/7/2017,"(CNN) James Comeys   opening statement in advance of his testimony before the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday about his relationship with Donald Trump in the months before the president fired him as FBI director reads like a novel.  Its the sort of document that will go down in the annals of political history    a sweeping condemnation of Trumps conduct in regard to both Comey and the ongoing federal investigation into fired national security adviser Michael Flynn. (You can read the whole thing here or my analysis of the whole thing here.) But, theres one exchange between the two men in the testimony that stood out to me as a perfect encapsulation of how radically different they are. Here it is in its entirety: Near the end of our dinner, the President returned to the subject of my job, saying he was very glad I wanted to stay, adding that he had heard great things about me from Jim Mattis, Jeff Sessions, and many others. He then said, I need loyalty. I replied, You will always get honesty from me. He paused and then said, Thats what I want, honest loyalty. I paused, and then said, You will get that from me. As I wrote in the memo I created immediately after the dinner, it is possible we understood the phrase honest loyalty differently, but I decided it wouldnt be productive to push it further. The term    honest loyalty    had helped end a very awkward conversation and my explanations had made clear what he should expect. Talk about two ships passing in the night. Trump, aggressive and oblivious to the rules of engagement, making a direct pitch to the FBI director for loyalty    and suggesting strongly that his future employment depended on the answer. Comey, all nerdy bureaucrat well aware of the lines being crossed, insisting all he could offer Trump was his honesty. Trump, a dealmaker used to always getting his way, hearing what he wants to hear and deciding the   phrase honest loyalty means Comey is good with the deal. Comey, knowing he wasnt good with any sort of deal, says nothing to end a very awkward conversation. And, scene.  Everything you need to know about the two men is contained in that single exchange. Everything. As is all the evidence you need to understand why they would never have any sort of working relationship. And why this was always fated to end badly."
Nunes wont say if he stepped aside in Russia probe,CNN,Tom LoBianco,6/7/2017,"(CNN) House intelligence committee Chairman Devin Nunes declined Tuesday to say if he had stepped aside from the House Russia probe    deflecting questions about his role one week after he signed off on the first subpoenas in the investigation.  Good try, Nunes said, when asked if he had stepped aside and if he would continue signing subpoenas. Nunes announced in April he was temporarily stepping aside from leading the investigation into Russias meddling in the 2016 elections, citing a series of ethics complaints filed against him. When asked again about his role in his committees investigation, the California Republican said, Im not going to talk about intelligence committee business. Rep. Michael Conaway, the Texas Republican now overseeing the Russia investigation in Nunes place, sounded unbothered about Nunes continued role.  Well get the ones issued that we need issued. Devin has the broader responsibilities on the committee than I do, Conaway told CNN Tuesday. So, well get every subpoena that (ranking Democrat Rep.) Adam (Schiff) and I want. Top Democrats in the House raised their ire last week after Nunes signed off on four subpoenas in the Russia investigation    and sent three more subpoenas focused on leaks and unmasking.  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi raised the issue of Nunes continued involvement in the probe in conversations with House Speaker Paul Ryan. And Schiff said Nunes role clearly violated his promise to step aside.  But other Democrats downplayed concerns Tuesday.  I just think its a big distraction, the jostling between Nunes and Conaway and whoever else, said a Democratic committee source. Its just getting in the way."
